I\u2019d like to welcome you to Adobe Systems First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; and Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO.","In the call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We\u2019ve also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, financial targets, and an updated investor datasheet on Adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to the Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links.","Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets, and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, March 17, 2016, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. ","For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure in the earnings press release we issued today, as well as Adobe\u2019s SEC filings. During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is available in our earnings release and in our updated investor datasheet on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website.","Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live in Adobe Connect, and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days, and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks Mike and good afternoon. Adobe\u2019s year is off to a strong start, with first quarter revenue of $1.38 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66. Adobe\u2019s opportunity has never been greater. Every brand, government agency, and educational institution is undergoing large-scale digital transformation. Creating a compelling experience for their customers and constituents across every touch point is paramount to their success, and they are turning to Adobe for help.","In Digital Media, Creative Cloud momentum continued in Q1 with strong adoption across all segments. There have never been more people creating content. Whether it\u2019s creative professionals, photographers, students or hobbyists creating compelling images, videos, websites, or mobile applications, our opportunity is to provide them with a one-stop shop for all their creative needs.","There are three primary growth drivers for Creative Cloud as we target a $17 billion addressable market: continuing to migrate our core base of Creative users, market expansion into new segments, and value expansion through new services. Our migration strategy focuses on driving Creative Suite users to our core offerings, Creative Cloud for individuals, teams and enterprises. In Q1 we executed well against this opportunity driving adoption across all routes to market, including Adobe.com, our channel partners, and Adobe direct sales.","Our market expansion strategy is to bring in new users, including photo enthusiasts and hobbyists with our Creative Cloud Photography plan. Over 30% of Creative Cloud subscribers are new to Adobe, and many are coming to us through our mobile apps. Over 23 million new Adobe IDs have been created through our mobile apps to date.","In terms of value expansion, we have begun to see the positive effect of Adobe Stock, our stock content marketplace, on our Creative revenue and ARR. Millions of Creatives use stock content and we believe Adobe has a tremendous opportunity to deliver additional value by seamlessly integrating Adobe Stock directly into the Creative Cloud service.","We intend to become the leader in this space through further product integration and new offerings, including stock video. In February, we added more than 100,000 native 4K video assets to Adobe Stock, which already includes more than 1 million video assets and more than 45 million images and graphics.","The primary benefit of a Creative Cloud subscription is access to Adobe\u2019s continuous innovation. Earlier this week, we announced the preview release of a brand new product, Adobe Experience Design CC, a design and prototyping product that empowers user experience designers to deliver new mobile apps and web sites quickly and easily. User experience design is one of the fastest growing creative disciplines. According to data from our Behance Creative Community of over 6.6 million Creatives, interaction design projects grew by 52% in 2015, more than any other creative field. We look forward to hearing feedback from our community as we work toward launching the product later this year.","Adobe\u2019s momentum continues in the video space, where we are now the leader in video production and editing. Over 175 films debuting at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival used Adobe Premiere Pro CC and other Creative Cloud tools. \u201cDeadpool\u201d is the latest blockbuster film to be edited exclusively with Adobe Premiere Pro.","Our footprint is extending beyond Creative pros to Creative consumers. In February, we introduced Adobe Post, a free mobile app that allows consumers to quickly and easily turn photos and text into beautifully designed graphics and share them on social media. It joins our other consumer mobile apps, Adobe Voice and Adobe Slate, in bringing fast and fun storytelling capabilities to a broad audience, including students and small businesses.","Adobe Document Cloud is becoming critical to the paper-to-digital transformation of document processes. More than 6 billion digital and electronic signature transactions are now processed through Document Cloud each year. Global businesses like The Royal Bank of Scotland, Scottrade, and NetApp rely on Document Cloud and Adobe Sign for fast, secure and mobile e-signatures.","In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $199 million and we exited the quarter with $393 million in ARR. Across our Creative and Document Cloud businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $3.13 billion as of the end of Q1.","We are the leader in the exploding digital marketing category. In Q1 we achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings, with revenue of $377 million which represents a 21% year-over-year increase. We continue to drive large-scale, multi-solution engagements with Marketing Cloud customers. Significant customer engagements in Q1 included RR Donnelly, Samsung Electronics, MGM Resorts International, Nissan, Workday, and Goldman Sachs.","At Adobe, we are focused on product innovation and Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions continue to garner accolades from industry analysts. Earlier this month, we were recognized by IDC as a Leader in its Worldwide Marketing Cloud Platforms vendor assessment, and Forrester Research recognized Adobe Analytics, the data and analytics backbone of Adobe Marketing Cloud, as a leader in its Customer Analytics Solutions Wave report. In January Gartner named Adobe as a leader in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs.","Adobe managed over 51 trillion customer data transactions through the Marketing Cloud over the past four quarters, and our Adobe Digital Index reports are increasingly being viewed as the source for reporting and predicting major retail and consumer trends. Yesterday, we launched our new Digital Economy Project, which includes three digital indicators of the U.S. economy \u2013 a digital price index, a housing index and a job seeking index.","Next week we will hold our Adobe Summit event in Las Vegas and we\u2019re expecting record-breaking attendance, including hundreds of our partners and main stage speakers from top brands including Cirque de Soleil, McDonald\u2019s, Comedy Central, Mattel, and Royal Bank of Scotland. Adobe Summit is the industry\u2019s leading digital marketing conference and the venue to learn where the industry is headed and see Adobe\u2019s latest technical advancements in mobile, video and data science.","For over 30 years, Adobe employees have demonstrated a sense of purpose and commitment to our communities and we\u2019re proud of the recognition we received in Q1 as both an employer and a good corporate citizen. We were included as one of the Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations and were recognized as Fortune\u2019s Most Admired Company within the software category.","While Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud, and Adobe Marketing Cloud are all leaders in their respective categories, our true opportunity is in bringing these solutions together. We have been unwavering in our mission to use content and data to deliver world-class experiences to our customers, whether they're on the web, in an app, in a retail store, or in a car.","Adobe is the only software company with deep history in content and vast data capabilities to deliver consistent, continuous, and compelling experiences. We have a robust technology platform, a thriving ecosystem of partners and developers, and a strong brand that has affinity worldwide with the world's largest enterprises, agencies, governments and educational institutions.","Our Q1 results demonstrate strong execution against this vast opportunity. Our market leadership, product differentiation, and continued momentum give us confidence to raise our fiscal 2016 revenue and earnings targets. Mark.","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. Before I comment on Q1 results, as a reminder, 2016 is a 53 week fiscal year with a 14 week first quarter. This was factored into all of the targets we provided in December.","In the first quarter of FY16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.383 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. We estimate the extra week added approximately $75 million of revenue to the quarter, but this was mainly offset by a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue of approximately $69 million. ","GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.50 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.66. These strong results reflect the continued momentum across our Cloud businesses. Highlights in our first quarter include: better-than-expected growth in Digital Media ARR, exiting the quarter with $3.13 billion, record Creative revenue of $733 million, which represents 44% year-over-year growth, record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million, which represents 21% year-over-year growth, strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $498 million, and exiting Q1 with a record 81% of Q1 revenue as recurring.","In Digital Media, we grew Q1 segment revenue by 33% year-over-year, and exited the quarter with Digital Media ARR of $3.13 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $733 million which represents year-over-year growth of 44%. We increased Creative ARR by $238 million during Q1.","Driving this strong performance was demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market, including the addition of 798,000 net-new Creative Cloud subscriptions during the quarter. Migration continues to represent a large opportunity. Creative Cloud continues to distance itself from Creative Suite, and Creatives are migrating as well as renewing at non-promotional pricing.","New customer adoption continues to increase our installed base. Creative Cloud mobile apps are driving new top-of-funnel traffic and first-time customer adoption. Market expansion is being driven by offerings such as the Creative Cloud Photography Plan which targets photo enthusiasts. Value expansion with new services like Adobe Stock are increasing ARPU and ARR.","Our performance across all of these offerings and the health of the business is best reflected in ARR. Because of this, moving forward we have decided to provide forward-looking quarterly ARR targets to help you better model the total business.","With respect to subscriptions, it has been our stated goal to attract tens of millions of customers at widely-varying price points. We reviewed this strategy with you back in October at our analyst meeting. Creative Cloud Photography Plan was our first market expansion offering, and has resulted in well over a million subscribers. New SKUs such as the recently announced K-through-12 education offering will make Creative Cloud available to millions of students. And as we said at the analyst meeting, we are also considering a mobile-only offering. All of this further dilutes the relevance of the number of subscribers as a measure of the health of the business.","In addition, with respect to Acrobat, customers have been able to choose to subscribe to Acrobat either through Creative Cloud, which has been reflected as Creative Cloud subscriptions and Creative ARR or via Document Cloud, which has been reflected in Document Cloud ARR. For all these reasons, while we might choose to periodically report subscriptions, we no longer intend to provide actuals on a quarterly basis. ","With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $199 million with Document Cloud ARR exiting the quarter of $393 million. Adoption of our new Acrobat DC offering was strong in Q1 both through the perpetual offering as well as in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings on Adobe.com, all of which is captured in Digital Media ARR.","In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $377 million. We delivered strong bookings during the quarter, and both the revenue and bookings in Q1 put us on pace to achieve our annual targets of approximately 20% revenue growth and 30% bookings growth. ","Other Marketing Cloud highlights in Q1 include: Strong year-over-year revenue growth across all Marketing Cloud solutions, continued growth in multi-solution adoption by our biggest customers, and mobile data transactions grew to 49% of total Adobe Analytics transactions. Our Digital Marketing segment revenue also includes LiveCycle and Connect, which declined as expected.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY16, versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY15; thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $7.6 million.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $48.1 million. We had $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY16, versus $23.7 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY15; thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $68.6 million.","In Q1, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 13% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the 2015 R&D tax credit. Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 14,154 versus 13,893 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 42 days, which compares to 44 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $498 million in the quarter.","Deferred revenue grew to $1.61 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.10 billion, compared to $3.99 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.5 million shares at a cost of $133 million. We currently have $1.48 billion remaining under our latest repurchase authority granted in January, 2015.","Now I will provide our financial outlook. When considering our targets for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, it is important to remember that the first quarter had an extra week of revenue which we estimate had an approximate benefit of $75 million. Based on Q2 being a standard 13 week quarter, we are targeting a second quarter revenue range of $1.365 billion to $1.415 billion dollars. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $275 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q2, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth.","In Digital Marketing, as we said in December, we expect Marketing Cloud quarterly year-over-year revenue growth will fluctuate below and above our annual FY16 target of approximately 20% growth based on the amount of perpetual revenue achieved in the prior year-ago quarter. Given this, we are targeting approximately 17% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q2, with continued momentum in bookings.","We expect our Q2 share count to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 23% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.42 to $0.48 per share, and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.64 to $0.70.","Based on Q1 upside and the benefit of strong Digital Media ARR momentum, we are raising certain full year financial targets. In Digital Media, we are increasing our Digital Media ARR exiting FY16 to approximately $4 billion, which is above our prior target of approximately $3.875 billion. We are increasing our targeted revenue for the year to approximately $5.8 billion, up from our prior target of approximately $5.7 billion. ","FY16 targeted EPS is now approximately $2 on a GAAP basis, and approximately $2.80 on a non-GAAP basis. Our prior FY16 EPS targets were approximately $1.80 on a GAAP-basis and approximately $2.70 on a non-GAAP basis.","In terms of color for the rest of the year, in Q3 we expect a slight sequential increase in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. We also expect Q3 Marketing Cloud revenue growth of less than 20% year-over-year due to the large amount of perpetual revenue in the year-ago quarter. In Q4 we expect seasonally strong sequential growth in both total revenue and Digital Media ARR. And we expect Q4 Marketing Cloud revenue growth greater than 20% year-over-year. In summary, Q1 was a great start to what will be another strong year for Adobe. Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks Mark.

Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. ","Brent Thill","Thanks and Mark on operating expenditures, you were running flat to low single-digit growth, this quarter you were up 15% year-over-year. Can you just give us a sense of where these incremental investments are going and maybe talk a little bit about the build out of the direct distribution team around the Marketing Cloud and your aspirations there?","Mark Garrett","Sure Brent, first off keep in mind we did have the extra week which impacts expense just like it impacts revenue. So a large chunk of that is based on just having the extra week. In addition we have merit increases that happened in the beginning of the year and you have got the full quarter effect of hires that you did in the fourth quarter. As you look out over the rest of the year, OPEX it won't be up sequentially just because of that extra week that you had in the first quarter and then you will see some growth in Q3 and Q4. And to your point that is more around driving sales and marketing capacity for the growth that we are seeing in all three clouds and the need to have that sales capacity on board as we get closer and closer to FY17. ","Brent Thill","Thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Ross MacMillan","Thanks very much and congratulations on a strong start. Shantanu on Mobile, our recent survey work suggest that mobile apps are actually driving some new subscribers to the Creative Cloud and I would love if you can maybe cast some light on how mobile was influencing the business going forward and especially around maybe monetization of mobile-only users? Thanks. ","Shantanu Narayen","Yeah Ross, and I saw your survey as well, that was good work. I mean clearly what we are finding is that the over 20 million people who are first coming to us on Mobile. It is serving as a great top of the funnel in terms of the new creators getting interest in Adobe and they experience our mobile apps and then they both subscribe to as well as download all of our desktop applications. And part of it is because they all recognize that the content that they are creating is going to be consumed in Mobile and in terms of working in groups that\u2019s the other thing that\u2019s driving both tablet, mobile, as well as PC usage. ","The new experience design project as well initial feedback has been very positive. People have been asking about how they can get that also as well on Mobile and Touch. And so we just look at the explosion of mobile devices and where both content is created and consumed and it\u2019s clearly being a tailwind, not just in the digital media business but also in the digital marketing business. And things like being able to take a picture and move that from camera into Photoshop, people just love the fact that they now have independence of where they can create content when inspiration strikes. ","Ross MacMillan","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. I was wondering Shantanu if you could talk a little about the educational SKUs that you guys have announced recently. If I recall correctly I think education was about with 25% of the units before you guys started this transition, can you just talk a little bit about where perhaps we are in that transition within education and some of the opportunities still see in front of us on that front? Thanks very much.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure Kirk. I mean as you correctly pointed out, education has always been one of the largest verticals in terms of the Creative products and we have multiple offerings. We certainly offer site licenses for both K-through-12 institutions as well as higher Ed. I mean the student and teacher addition and then there is lab usage of our products. So, big picture what we are trying to do is make sure that in any setting that exists that we have the right Creative products. Creative in the education season tends to be Q3. We certainly believe that there is tens of millions of Creatives as they come into the market as part of the education segment, that\u2019s a growth for us and that\u2019s part of the reason why in Mark's prepared remarks also he talked about as we continue to offer our Creative products as a site license that we don\u2019t talk about sub. So, it\u2019s going well. More and more people are using our Creative products. Internationally also we are starting to have education be adopted. But big picture we look at it and say whether it\u2019s a student teacher single edition, whether it\u2019s an institution, or whether it\u2019s a lab usage. We want to make sure that our offering is applicable in all of those settings. ","Kirk Materne","Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. ","Kash Rangan","Hi, thank you guys. I am curious if you can give us some feel for the momentum for stock in this particular quarter, can you roughly quantify how many in terms of subscribers you added for stock? And Shantanu maybe a quick refresher on what are your longer term attached rate targets for stock perhaps netting three to four years within the Creative family? And if you have the time what was that Marketing Cloud bookings in this quarter, bookings growth rate in this quarter? Thank you. ","Shantanu Narayen","So multiple questions there Kash, let me try and pass them one by one. The first is as it relates to revenue for stock during the quarter it was in line with our expectations so it\u2019s doing well. Again just to refresh folks, we offer on demand stock as a way for people to buy particular stock assets. We certainly offer a stock only subscription and we then offer a combined subscription which allows people to both access stock as well as our desktop products. And so across all of them we are continuing to see accelerated usage of the stock subscriptions. We don\u2019t break that out Kash in terms of what it is and that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re focused on just continuing to make sure we gain market share in the stock and deliver value. I think big picture as we\u2019ve always said over 80% of the people who are buying or selling stock are using our products and that\u2019s the opportunity. ","From a roadmap point of view we look at integrating the stock service more directly within our applications as a way to both increase awareness for our customers and to improve their workflow. So as the year progresses we continue to expect to do better in stock moving forward. So off to a good start and it's only in the entire marketplace strategy for Adobe. And with respect to bookings I think Mark also alluded to the fact that they were strong. We did not see any seasonal slowdown from Q4 to Q1 in terms of how we look at the business. And one of the things I should probably state is when you look at the Digital Marketing revenue for Q1. It is actually being driven primarily by the bookings that we had last year, now translating into things getting live. There really wasn\u2019t much perpetual revenue in the quarter. So, the good news is that marketing is all as a result of the strong bookings we experienced last year. ","Mark Garrett","In fact to add on to that when you see the Q you will see the Digital Marketing segment, the whole segment subscription revenue is up 25% year-over-year for the whole Digital Marketing segment which is great. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open. ","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Just want to follow up on the Adobe Stock portfolio items, so specifically it sounds like you are gaining traction. Wondering what that\u2019s going to do to the ARPU in the Creative side versus the offset that you still have because of the expanding \u2013 with photography bundle and things like that so what's that tug of war look like and what should we be thinking around ARPU trends from here?","Mark Garrett","Hi Sterling, it's Mark. You know that\u2019s why frankly this average ARPU number gets very difficult to use as a gauge for the business. If you look at just Creative, we certainly expect that Stock will raise the ARPU for the Creative Professional, the people that are going to buy Stock. It just doesn\u2019t make sense to look at the average any more especially for all the reasons we articulated around subs with millions of people potentially buying this K-through-12 education bundle or as you said millions of people buying CCPP. But Stock will add to ARPU for the Creative Professional. ","Shantanu Narayen","And as it relates to the overall ARPU in the quarter again Sterling we continue to see for the core creative product an increase in ARPU very much in line as people renew at non-promotional pricing. ","Sterling Auty","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. ","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you. I just had a couple of questions. I was wondering now that you have a multiple years under your belt if you\u2019ve seen with the change to subscription if you\u2019d seen any change in the level of piracy and have you been able to combat that in any way with the new way of subscribing to the software? And then secondarily I might have missed this but did you give out the percentage of subs that were suite subscriptions versus single app?","Shantanu Narayen","So Heather let me take both. The first is when you look at the number of new users that we\u2019ve stated who are part of the Creative platform which is 30% of the people who are doing business with us, there is no question that our surveys and anecdotal evidence speak to the fact that people who may have formally pirated or used our products casually are paying for the service because its far more affordable. As you know we are seeing increased growth in international markets where there was more piracy. The reality is we still haven't offered the Creative Cloud product in China as Creative Cloud. So all of that is upside for us in terms of combating piracy, there is so much opportunity in the developed markets that\u2019s where we focus. So, making progress and we continue to think as we roll it out in other markets around the world it's going to impact it. With respect to the single app versus the complete, as we said it's going to gravitate towards 50:50 in the quarter. I think it was 52% CC Complete. ","Mark Garrett","Right. ","Heather Bellini","Okay, great. Thank you so much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein. Your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Hi, this is Dan calling in for Mark, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the opportunity for ARPU expansion outside of Stock. Obviously Stock is a homerun in terms of driving up ARPU and I know you mentioned the average ARPU in subs numbers becoming less meaningful as the mix becomes more complex but if you can just talk about what you see as opportunity for ARPU expansion outside of stock that will be really helpful? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Well the opportunity for ARPU expansion around Stock is as we are attracting people to the platform we\u2019re certainly attracting them at what we would call promotional pricing. So that\u2019s one big opportunity and we\u2019re clearly seeing as people come onto the Creative Cloud platform they typically come from CS6 and prior versions where we give them a promotional pricing and then convert it into the full pricing. The other opportunity for ARPU expansion is moving from single app to the entire product. The third opportunity for ARPU expansion is Acrobat. We\u2019re certainly seeing a lot of people and that\u2019s why we\u2019re moving them more through the Creative Cloud funnel as opposed to the Document Cloud funnel, up selling them into the entire product. And last but certainly not least while it is not called ARPU within the enterprise as well as we move from selling what used to be custom like solutions of Creative Suite into the entire Creative Cloud Complete. ","So, even on the core desktop products there is ARPU expansion against all of those four. Then in addition to that it\u2019s the new services that we\u2019ve introduced and will continue to introduce that represents ARPU expansion. And as you know in our Analyst Meeting we provided therefore the entire TAM available for us on both the Creative Cloud as well as the Document Cloud as part of Digital Media. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Fantastic, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. ","Keith Weiss","Excellent, thank you guys and again congratulations on a great quarter. Shantanu I want to follow on something that -- the comment that you made about the lack of seasonality in the quarter going from a Q4 to Q1 which is a lot different than what we saw last year at the time particular when it came to a subscriber add. Anything in particularly you could point to for why that happened or what was different this year than last year and the efforts you guys do to sort of sustain that level of any subscriber so much better? ","Shantanu Narayen","Well, I think there are a couple of things. I think at the macro level Keith firstly the solutions that we are providing I think are playing to what is a very key need in the marketplace which is everybody is dealing with digital transformation, everybody is trying to bring their businesses online. So there is no question in the marketing side as it relates to the kinds of solutions we offer. But the demand is only getting greater in organizations around the world. So I think that\u2019s one issue. Certainly the fact that we are doing less perpetual also factors into this and so as you think about the traditional Q4 to Q1, they would be big perpetual pushes and then it would sort of fall off. The third thing I would give is our marketing group is doing a much better job of having consistent demand and growing demand so we\u2019re looking at it not just as fiscal boundaries but as a continuous process of driving demand for our particular solution. So I think there are a number of things and then on the Creative side, I think it just continues to be opportunity to migrate customers and attract new customers. So I think for all of those four reasons we feel good about our business and we feel like they are in the sweet spot of what customers need right now. ","Keith Weiss","Excellent, thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. ","Brendan Barnicle","Good afternoon and Happy St. Patrick's Day. Thanks for taking my questions. Shantanu there is a lot of concerns about the macro economy particularly in the most recent quarter I was interested what you saw in the quarter in the U.S. and globally, particularly given your new Adobe Digital economy project? And just a quick one for Mark, can you remind us of the distribution breakdown between Adobe.com, the Channel, and Adobe direct sales right now? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Well clearly we saw a strong demand and we did not see any issues from the macro economy and that\u2019s the reason for both the strong quarter as well as the strong outlook not just for Q2 but for the rest of the year. So if there is macro economic conditions that are impacting other peoples businesses, we haven't seen that yet. I think even should that happen as you know we are far more near to that as a result of the recurring business, but we didn\u2019t see any demand weakness anywhere in the world. ","Mark Garrett","As it relates to route to market there is no doubt that we want Adobe.com to be the premier place people come to do business with us and it's becoming a much bigger piece of the business than it has overtime. As well our business from a direct sales perspective would come in right behind that. And then channel while its always going to be important to us it has just been shrinking consistently. I think at some point of levels off its not going to go away. But we really want to go direct and we want to go through adobe.com.","Brendan Barnicle","Great, thanks so much. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you, good evening, couple questions for Mark. I noticed that in your prepared remarks you didn\u2019t make any mention of ETLAs and could you comment on how those performed within the context of the increase in Creative ARRs sequentially. Your total subject were substantially ahead of our forecast but your Creative ARR was right in line, so I am wondering if perhaps you had somewhat flatter performance relatively in ETLAs? And then secondly you had quite substantial growth margin improvement sequentially in both businesses both Digital Media and Digital Marketing, if you could comment on what's driving the improvement in Digital Media gross margin including a sequential decline of your cost revenue there? Thanks. ","Shantanu Narayen","Sure Jay, you\u2019re right. As it relates to ETLAs there is some seasonality and you\u2019ll see that reflected in the ARR numbers for Creative and for doc services. So there is some seasonality in the ETLAs. On the gross margin side, a lot of that just has to do with the stacking effect frankly of having these subscribers build up overtime and not needing to add as much cost structure to support them because you\u2019ve got critical mass. So, it\u2019s a benefit of the stacking effect on the Creative side. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. ","Steve Ashley","Alright, terrific, thanks so much. I'd like to talk about the Adobe Experience Design products that have been previewed now, seems have gotten a very nice response in the market and I am just wondering the users of that product, I am assuming as current customers do you foresee this as being an incremental purchase for these people or is it something that you would use in place of other Adobe products they\u2019ve used in the past? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Steve I think what we\u2019re seeing as big phenomenon in the Creative market is more people doing design and prototyping. It certainly is the traditional Creatives who\u2019ve been doing design and prototyping and they may have used products like Photoshop or Illustrate or Fireworks from Adobe in the past. But I actually think that there is a new community of people, product managers all around the world, the way we are designing products right now is they are doing a prototyping of what that product looks like, whether that\u2019s on mobile or on the web. And so I think this inherent need for people to have designed far more as a part of product creation I think will lead the experienced design product to be used not just by our existing customers but also by a whole new set of customers who are thinking about how do they use design to create a new generation of Experience product. So I am very excited about it, the feedback has been really good, but I do think product managers, the new breed of product managers that exist in startups they will all need to use a product such as the Experience Design product. ","Steve Ashley","Great, thanks. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian Wieser","Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about Marketing Cloud and the competitive environment as you\u2019re seeing it attach rate of different products and if what you think your customers are taking full suite versus individual products and maybe at the same time if you might be able to comment about how your recent issues of data, the data marketplace might be impact from the business at this point?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, with respect to the marketing cloud I think we continue to be the most both unified as well as comprehensive offering that\u2019s out there in the market. The results are driven not just by new logos and the new logos are increasingly using multiple solutions when they start off but also with certainly up selling existing customers to new solutions. So I think we\u2019re seeing that across the space. In terms of competition as we said even at the analyst meeting when you have a $27 billion opportunity you are going to attract other customers but I think we\u2019re so far ahead of them, we continue to be rated and we continue to innovate. On the data market stuff, stay tuned. Next week is our Summit and we\u2019re going to be talking a lot more about some of the exciting areas that we have on data. And so hopefully you are going to be at Summit and we\u2019ll share more at that time. ","Brian Wieser","I will be there, curious so maybe to your point as new entrants and obviously I was thinking of Google but try to push harder into this space, do you see that they are -- whether it's them or others that they are really tapping into other marketers and maybe you are not and that its helping contribute to growth is totally consistent?","Shantanu Narayen","Well I think with respect to what's happening we used to target the Chief Revenue Officer, the Chief Digital Officer, the Chief Marketing Officer within the enterprise and I think that has now expanded to being a C level issue all the way up to the CEO in terms of the customer journey. I think there are companies who are certainly providing the ad stack for this customer journey. There would be people who provide the experience for the customer journey and the analytics. So in that sense you are right, I mean it is -- the opportunity is dramatically expanding because this is becoming front end and center not just for the marketing function but also at the C level function. ","Brian Wieser","Great, thank you. ","Mike Saviage","Carl we\u2019re approaching the end of the hour, why don\u2019t we take two more questions. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Rogers from Citi. Your line is open. ","Walter Pritchard","Hey guys, I am Walter, just wanted to see if you can get some more color on net adds and just the strength there, is that more internationally or is that kind of the net new to the franchise ads or potentially kind of Acrobat stuffs that are coming through the Creative Cloud funnel, just some color there would be great?","Shantanu Narayen","I think it\u2019s all of the above in terms of where the net ads were. You\u2019re right, it was strong net ads. We certainly as it relates to the document businesses or Acrobat there was a fair amount. We definitely have a clear preference for customers to adopt Acrobat DC through the Creative funnel so that shows up as net adds in the Creative funnel because that gives us permission to up sell them to the Photography plan. But team did well, team continues to do well and so we\u2019re seeing strength. International, Japan and Germany that we\u2019ve identified as areas for growth are growing nicely. There still is a significant opportunity there to migrate existing customers and attract new customers. So I would say those markets are a couple of years behind but we haven't seen any slowdown in the U.S. yet. ","Walter Pritchard","Thanks. ","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Nandan Amladi from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Nandan Amladi","Hi, good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. So Mark question for you on metrics, since you are no longer going to be providing the Creative Cloud subscriber count historically we\u2019ve sort of used your commentary on ARPU and the units to back into LA number or ETLA number. Going forward as you provide just the ARR number would you be providing any finer segmentation of that?","Mark Garrett","Not right now. The best way to do the model from my perspective would be to take ARR which we\u2019re now going to guide to quarterly, so we did say we will add some additional guidance by giving you ARR every quarter. And you can take that ARR and do a waterfall flowing that into revenue to get a sense of what revenue is. To be honest with you, using what you were using which was a sub number that was incomplete and an average ARPU number, it really doesn\u2019t work anyway. We\u2019ll periodically give you more insight into what's going on like we do at analyst days and things like that. But the best way to do it is to take that ARR number and flow it through into revenue. ","Shantanu Narayen","And Nandan I think as Mark said, the goal is to continue to help you model the business and provide more color on ARR so that you get a sense not just for the overall health of the business but the various components. And since that was the last question, I mean just a couple of comments, as I am travelling around the world meeting both customers and partners, it is really clear that consumer expectations and what's happening with technology is causing every business to rethink how they interact with customers. And I think that\u2019s a digital first strategy right now for every one of them. From our point of view that great experience starts with great content. We\u2019re clearly the company that\u2019s helping bringing their concepts to life for Creatives and Creative Cloud is clearly the one stop shop for these customers providing everything from inspiration to monetization. ","I think the other thing we see is delivering that experience to the right person at the right time requires a technology platform that deals with large volumes of content and data but more importantly with the right intelligence and that\u2019s the goal of the Adobe Marketing Cloud. ","All of these tailwinds we see now benefiting our businesses and I think in Q1 we saw a strength across Creative Cloud adoption and ARR growth, DC and Acrobat adoption as well as strong bookings and revenue, and implementations that are going live with the Adobe Marketing Cloud. And that\u2019s the reason why our Q1 upside and Q2 outlook gave us confidence to raise the revenue as well as earnings target. We think we are in great shape, we remain focused on driving innovation, and strong financial results and I want to thank our customers and partners worldwide for their ongoing commitment and to our employees for continuing to drive innovation in our industry. We hope to see you folks next week at Summit and otherwise we will look forward to our next call. Thank you for joining us today. ","Mike Saviage","And this call concludes our call, thank you.

Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO was approximately $8.37 billion exiting Q2, which compares to $8.13 billion exiting Q1.","Deferred revenue exiting Q2 was $3.13 billion. The sequential decline in deferred revenue was a result of timing rather than business performance due to fewer billing cycles in our second quarter. The impact was more than offset by an increase in unbilled backlog. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $3.48 billion, and cash flow from operations was $1.11 billion in the quarter.","In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares at a cost of $659 million. We currently have $6.6 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018 which goes through 2021.","Now I will discuss our financial targets. As a reminder, our Q3 includes the summer months of June, July and August and we expect normal seasonality to influence our results during the quarter.","In Q3 FY2019, we are targeting revenue of approximately $2,800,000,000, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $360 million, Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 34%, other expense of approximately $22 million, tax rate of approximately 11% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, share count of approximately 491 million shares, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.40, and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.95.","As usual, we are not updating annual targets at this time of the year. We are pleased with our first half performance and we expect our first half momentum to continue in the second half, with typical seasonality in Q3 and strength in Q4. We continue to expect sequential operating margin growth as we move through the second half of the year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, John.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Good afternoon. Shantanu, just on Magento and Marketo, just curious if you could give us your updated thoughts on the integration? How you're doing in the field? And some of the customer traction on both those acquisitions, that would be helpful? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Brent. Both of them are actually big picture going really well. We have, as you saw, started to integrate the products, the delivery of the Adobe Commerce Cloud that was based on Magento Commerce. We announced some good partnerships there as well as it relates to what we are doing with Amazon to allow multiple small and medium businesses to be able to deliver their storefronts based on this combined technology.","We did some good work as it related to integration between the Adobe Experience Manager as well as the Adobe Commerce Cloud, so you can now have in a single digital foundation the ability to do web content management, analytics as well as commerce. So product integration with Magento is going well.","I think on the go-to-market efforts, the enterprise motion that we have, which is clearly a strength of Adobe, we are putting the Magento solutions through that enterprise go-to-market motion. We've also done a good job, I think of integrating the mid-market, small and medium business, whatever you want to call it, the Magento and Marketo because the combination of both of them give us a little bit more heft in the marketplace.","And on Marketo as well, I mean, it's clearly a fabulous SaaS platform for engagement as it relates to B2B marketing, the focus there has been on both integration with Adobe Analytics as well as making sure that the combination of Campaign and Marketo will be the best B2E, which is what we call sort of the business to everyone engagement platform.","So pleased with it, results are good, continued focus and I think that's one of the reasons why we are aligning the organizations more rapidly to make sure that we get the appropriate alignment.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jennifer Lowe with UBS. Please go ahead.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. It was nice to see the net new ARR outperformance this quarter. So it sounds like it was a few different things there, but just any more color on what drove the upside would be great. In particular, I know last quarter there were some unusual items in there. I just want to check was there anything unusual this quarter. And maybe just around it out, as we think about seasonality into Q3, it looks like the guide implies a bit more seasonality than what we saw last year, anything to keep in mind there as well? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. I think big picture, Jennifer, Digital Media, we continue to do really well. We had, as you point out a great Q2 achieving I think $406 million in net new ARR, which is a record for Q2. Certainly, I think in terms of the different offerings, as John mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are seeing traction on the video offerings, we're seeing traction with enterprise adoption, services, both Stock and Sign are continuing to perform quite well, international expansion continues to be an area of opportunity as well as new customer acquisition through the marketing campaigns that we have.","And if you think about, as you pointed out again, the $360 million target that we're putting for Q3, which would be a record for a Q3 and then you add to that what the $750 million plus in ARR for the first half, I mean it's clear that the momentum continues in the business, I think to your question around seasonality and color.","I think it's our expectation that net new DM ARR in Q4 would be similar to what we had last year in Q4. And so, if you add that all up, it implies that we will have record new ARR again in 2019. And I think underlying all of that, as we've outlined to you is the DDOM model that we have, it allows us to optimize our marketing spend, it allows us to engage better with customers, and MAX should be another great show for that business. One thing I should also mention, sorry, is that, Acrobat continues to, as you clearly saw from the results, do really well.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Hi, Keith, your line is open. You may be on mute.","Keith Weiss","Sorry about that, I was on mute. Thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter. I wanted to touch based on kind of leadership on the Digital Experience side of the equation. I'm kind of \u2013 what the current thought process is, I'm sure Shantanu, you're doing a great job sort of with leadership there, but are we planning on replacing Brad and kind of what's the sort of the game plan for rolling out new leadership and how sort of the new assets are going to sit under that new leadership plan?","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Keith, for the question. It's such a large opportunity that we're completely convinced, I am that the focus on the aligned organization was the right choice. It's been great. I focus a lot of time on the customer, just I think over the last 10 days three Fortune 100 CEOs have come in to talk to us about our view and our vision for digital transformation, spent a lot of time on the product to make sure that we get great alignment.","You've seen the general availability of the Adobe Experience Platform, the Artificial Intelligence features that we're now in beta attribution and customer journey. We've signed some great partnerships with Software AG and ServiceNow. And really, I've been trying to focus also the organization on a lot more with respect to customer centricity.","I think as we've aligned the two acquisitions of Magento and Marketo, which we've outlined to you, Keith, was a priority. We brought the same rigor that we have in DDOM for creating that cadence and customer centricity for pipeline progression, for marketing demand generation, as well as for the software delivery lifecycle. And so, I'm really also pleased with how the current management team, which is extremely strong and has stepped up and is executing an alignment.","So, while the search continues, we haven't missed a beat and I've been spending a lot of time, which just continues to give me a lot of faith in the long-term opportunity associated with the business and it's not hampering the progress at all in terms of what we need to do.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Sounds great.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent. Thanks so much, and congrats as well on a great quarter. Shantanu, on customer data platforms, there's been a lot of recent news from Adobe as well as some of your competitors launching their own CDP offerings. How will Adobe Experience Platform differentiate from peers? And why is your product going to be better and wining the market?","Shantanu Narayen","It's a good question, Brad. And I think fundamentally it stems from the fact that when you have the leading content management platform, we have the data and I think that continues to differentiate us in terms of the customer interaction across different channel points.","We've been talking to you for a couple of years of the investment that we've made in the Adobe Experience Platform, the vision there has always been not only to integrate all of our existing solutions, so we have a platform across content and data to win it, but to frankly stitch together all that customer profile in real-time.","And when you have all that customer interaction that's happening as a result of mobile access to the website or website access or as customers are giving us access to the other channel data, that's just as unique differentiator that no other company has. So we start off from that being a huge advantage.","I think the effort that we've put into an ecosystem of partnerships there in terms of ingesting that data, the common taxonomy that we've agreed to the partnership with SAP and Microsoft on ODI, and, frankly, the credibility that we just continue to get associated with the fact that when you're processing these hundreds of trillions of transactions on an annual basis that we have more insight to be able to activate it, I think all of that gives us hope.","I think with the whole Experience Cloud, I will continue to reinforce that when we talk about it being north of a $70 billion addressable market, you should look at this as it's not a win\/loss kind of situation, there's just so much opportunity. But starting with what we had with Audience Manager and DMP that we had with Demdex combined with what we are doing in CDP and making sure that that all operates in real-time, I think that is just a unique combination for Adobe.","Brad Zelnick","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Saket Kalia","Hey, thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for you, Shantanu, just to dig into one of the prior questions on Creative, Adobe Spark seems to be doing very well. So can you just talk a little bit about why you think that's doing so well? And maybe more specifically talk about what you've seen in the last couple of years that Spark has been available? What you've seen in terms of lifetime value and customer acquisition cost qualitatively? ","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Saket, I mean I think it stems from this fundamental assertion and hypothesis that we have \u2013 beliefs that we have that everyone has a story to tell. And when you have K-12 student all the way to the largest enterprises in the world wanting to use social media, wanting a quick template-based approach to start to be able to express themselves and then grow that expertise into using our products, it's just a fantastic on-ramp.","And so the millions of customers that we have, the penetration in the education segment is both an opportunity in itself, but frankly great brand building and awareness of what the Adobe Solutions can do across the spectrum. And so, I think it really \u2013 we've been talking about this for a while, but it's the golden age of creativity and design and it doesn't matter whether you're studying history or geography, I mean, the ability to express yourself visually and graphically and to do that across social channels is just such an intrinsic part of what it is and I think we've really struck a chord with the great, great product across both mobile.","I think the fact that we're exploring different platforms and previously we used to look at print and web as a platform, now we look at even channels like YouTube as a platform. It's just a great in addition to mobile, way to attract new customers. So I think that's why it really resonates with customers and while it'll continue to be both from an ARR perspective of growth as well as from overall brand and awareness, just a significant ability for us to continue to keep Digital Media ARR momentum going.","Saket Kalia","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Maybe I can bring John into the conversation here, kind of curious, as you look at the growth in Creative Cloud for the quarter? Is there a way to disaggregate how much of that growth has actually come from, the price changes that you've made over X number of quarters versus how much that growth is actually coming from pure volume?","John Murphy","Yes, sure. It's really coming from both. And when you think about the North America price increase that we did last year in Q2 that as we said was going to be accretive and certainly through the year as we now anniversary that price increase.","And then earlier this year, in February, we did a price increase for a Dark Cloud and also in EMEA for Creative. So all these things are accretive, but one of the things that we've talked about for a long time now is, attracting new users to the platform is really our biggest growth opportunity and we're able to do that through the various new products that are attracting folks to our platform because some of these newer products are easier to use and then as they get comfortable with those, they end up \u2013 we're able to upsell them into full suite of products for multiple applications.","So we had this opportunity to really kind of tack load from many different ways. And we've been successful now in growing the number of users across the platform and also leveraging the mobile app on ramp.","Shantanu Narayen","But if you think of it in terms of material, it's primarily new user growth and new subscriptions, Sterling, is how you should think about it. I think the value that we're providing enables us to keep driving at the anniversary of people moving over to the new pricing, keep them as loyal customers and improve their engagement. But as it relates to the photography and video, it's primarily new user growth that's driving the Digital Media ARR.","Sterling Auty","Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kash Rangan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kasthuri Rangan","Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations. I'm curious given the strength in the quarter. You had a very nice quarter on net new ARR, and on the Experience Cloud side, you had very good bookings as well. But when I look at the guidance, you didn't change the guidance for the year. But Q3 numbers look a little bit right relative for the Street, it's just a function of conservatism given, maybe a questionable macro environment, or is it just that the seasonality of the business?","We've had the firsthand chance to model the seasonality of the business, including the acquisitions and that we may have been a little off relative to what is the new seasonality of Adobe? Just wondering what your thoughts are there? Thank you so much, and congrats.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, I think, Kash, thanks first. I mean, big picture, it's clear. We're having another record year and great execution against both growth opportunities across all of the three marketing clouds, Creative, Document and Experience. And as you point out, the results, revenue growth of 25%, the significant cash flow as well as the strong EPS, while we're increasing margins.","I think on Digital Media, I gave some color as it related to what will certainly be a record Digital Media ARR year and I think we factor in seasonality, and so that's I think part of how you should be thinking about Q3 versus Q4.","And in DX as well, I mean the subscription revenue growth, if you look at that, when you see the revenue growth of 34%, the subscription revenue growth certainly has exceeded that and it's closer to 39%. And so I think that also reflects the success that we continue to have and the fact that we have the leading SaaS enterprise platform for enterprises to engage digitally with their customers.","And so, I think big picture, the two opportunities continue to be significant tailwinds. We're executing well against it. I think we'll give you more color as it relates to Q4 in September as well as 2020 at MAX. But continue to be really optimistic. And I think where we are in the quarter, just updating annual numbers for a year is akin to giving Q3 and Q4 targets and that's why, as you know, typically we don't do that. But that should not change the fact that we have momentum in the business and optimism for the future.","Kasthuri Rangan","Congrats, Shantanu and team. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you so much. I really appreciate, and congrats also on the quarter. So you've guided to 34% digital marketing growth for the back half of the year. What's the more difficult set of compares as you lap Magento's acquisition and lap a bit of the Marketo? Can you give us a bit more color on what's driving that strength? I appreciate.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. I think as it relates to the Digital Experience business, we've always outlined, Mark, that the focus has been on driving subscription bookings. I think as the deferred revenue also starts to taper off, that's certainly going to factor into what happens. But it's just a large addressable opportunity. We have the market leading products and we continue to be excited about how we execute against that. So that's how I would think about that particular business.","Mark Moerdler","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Yes. Thank you, good evening. Shantanu, a technology strategy question, I was hoping we could parse through with plethora of three-letter acronyms that Adobe has been sharing with us at Summit and on other occasions. We now have CDP, CXM, CXP, XPM and so forth.","The question is, ultimately does Adobe have a single underlying data model that is the Adobe Data Model, or could you foresee two or more principal data models, particularly in DX? I ask in part because at Summit in EMEA last month, there was some mention in one of the sessions about you are having a new purpose built B2B data model, and so maybe you could put this in the context of the complexity of the architecture or the technology as it might relate to any implications for R&D and sales efficiency?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. You forgot ODI and maybe a couple of other TLAs, Jay, but it's a good question. And I think as it relates to how we think about the technology underpinnings, we think about it from two strategic points of view. The first is, are we able in our own products to have a common way in which people can really provide integration for our existing applications better than any other individual point product vendor can provide?","And I think our track record, as you know better than most in terms of what we have done on the Digital Media side of having colors and types and font faces work well, that is the reason why the underlying data model allows us to have things like campaigns or segments or audiences work better across our applications than anybody else. And so, we did that heavy lifting associated with having a common way to define the taxonomy, the customer journey across our products.","We clearly saw that that was not going to be adequate in terms of the aspirations we had to actually being the underlying sort of infrastructure for how all companies deal with digital transformation and the reasons for the partnership with both Microsoft as well as with SAP is to actually through ODI and make that true not just for customer behavioral data where we clearly have access to all of that data, but also to extend that to financial data, to transactional data over time to IoT data.","And so, the way I would think about it is, it's a common taxonomy, it's a common way for people to extend it, but we don't have to do the heavy lifting of defining everything. The beauty of the model is that actually we defined the framework, we defined the API, we defined the services and other people can actually extend and augment that, and so it enables the entire ecosystem to partner. So it's exciting.","We delivered that through the Adobe Experience Platform. I talked in the prepared remarks about how we have early beta customers who are starting to see it. Certainly, Adobe is using it in our own offering. But I think it's really going to be the underlying infrastructure for our next generation enterprise who wants to engage with their customers. So we're excited about that.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks, Shantanu.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. Shantanu, I want to ask a little bit about Sensei in the context of, is that coming up at all and it's under conversations on the Experience Cloud side. I know there's a lot of factors that go into those decisions from a product portfolio perspective. I was just kind of curious, if Sensei is adding to the conversation if you view that as sort of a needle mover for you all at this point? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","I'm really glad you asked that question, because we talk a lot about the Adobe magic that we've had in the Digital Media products and we certainly touched on what we've done with Content-Aware Fill, which is magic as it relates to being able to do that across frames and reduce a whole bunch of complexity for the video products.","We are investing very heavily in the same technology Sensei in the Experience Cloud. Let me maybe give you a couple of examples to make it more tangible. I mean, the first is when you're doing search, the way you do search when you're doing it in Digital Media trying to find an object in Stock where we have the best technology is still substantially different from the way you would do search, in Commerce where you're looking for an object maybe based on a color or based on a type of preference.","So I think in Commerce, that's one area where Sensei and the ability to do search and find the right shopping good that you're interested in. That's a game changer in targeting and in what we can do around how we can optimize targets and recommendations, that's another area where AI is certainly beneficial. When you're talking about a subscription model and customer preference and a prediction score of who's likely to churn and what are the best way to engage with them across channels, that's another area where we have AI technology.","But in addition to that, as part of the experience platform, we actually now have modules. I talked a little bit about attribution.AI and things like that, which are AI modules and frameworks for people to actually augment the Experience Cloud. So I think, unlike other companies, we believe that the AI is best built in into each of the existing solutions and through frameworks, but our track record of delivering against that has been strong and it's only getting better.","Kirk Materne","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Thomas Roderick","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. John, let me throw this one at you, just looking at the Digital Experience segment itself, we saw a nice bounce back in the segment gross margins and part of that, of course came into scale and some of the deferred revenue write-downs rolling off.","But the other part, of course, is realizing some of the integrations between the components. And I was hoping you could speak to what you're seeing with some of the leverage between the properties of Magento and Marketo, and the core of Digital Experience, in particular on the COGS side, are there elements of architectural leverage that are starting to show up and then even below that line are you seeing much sales leverage between the acquired properties? Thank you.","John Murphy","Yes. No, absolutely. For sure, we're seeing the ability in both properties that we acquired for us to be able to unify development across the platform and that in of itself provides us some efficiencies. In addition, from the go-to-market perspective, as we've talked about, we've unified and aligned our go-to-market strategy with the existing Adobe Enterprise sales organization under Matt and so that's been able to bring a lot more efficiency as we cross-sell not only the existing Digital Experience products, but also Magento and Marketo.","Not to mention then our partner ecosystem where we are selling alongside Microsoft, for example, and being successful in having multi-solution sales with them as well. So it's been something that through scale and through continued focus on the integration that we're able to get some leverage out of that.","Thomas Roderick","Excellent. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","The one thing, maybe, I'd like to add to that, I know there was some question around seasonality and while this question was specifically around operating margins, I think cash Adobe, so maybe we'd give you color on how we think about our investment as well as what's happening as it relates to margins.","I think it's clear that despite the revenue growth and investment that the operating margin of the company has improved throughout the year and I think we remain very focused on profitability. If you look at seasonally how that should play out over the second half of the year, our guide for Q3 shows EPS increasing by approximately, I think $0.12 despite seasonality. And we certainly expect Q4 to be a strong seasonally finish to the year.","And I think to give you some color on that while we are not updating our annual targets, we would expect that sequential EPS growth from Q3 to Q4 to be about 3x the growth from Q2 to Q3. So hopefully, that gives you some color on how we think about the investments. We certainly continue to believe in investing for the revenue growth that we're seeing and it also clearly gets us back to north of 40% margin. So hopefully, that gives you some color on seasonality as well as while the question was on gross margins how we think about operating margins and expenses.","Thomas Roderick","Really helpful, Shantanu. Thank you.","Mike Saviage","Operator, I think we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our final question from Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Thanks. Question on the Digital Experience side, you've been talked in the past about a 25% growth in the book of business, including the two acquisitions. I'm wondering, sort of how things are tracking so far this year and what you've learned in terms of first half growth as that trend progresses into the second half?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. As you know, Walter, we don't update how we're doing against the bookings during the year as we think about the underlying dynamics of the industry and the need for Digital Experience solution. Nothing diminishes the belief that we have that that continues to be a large growth opportunity.","I think as you could see from the subscription revenue growth that we see, we continue to focus on executing against that. And so we'll certainly provide more color as we've said on that on an annual basis. But I just big picture the \u2013 available opportunity, I think continues to be large.","And given Mike said that that was the last question, maybe just as a quick summary again, it's clear that we have the right strategy and the focus on delivering great customer value. We're pleased with the first half financial results, so we expect that momentum to continue in the second half. The strategy of empowering people to create and helping businesses transform. We believe that continues to be a north of 100 billion addressable market opportunity.","And we're really pleased with the attendance that we saw at the customer events in the DX, and whether it was the Summits in the U.S. and Europe, whether it was Marketo Marketing Nation, whether it was a Magento Imagine. I think that just reflects both the leadership that we have in product strategy and vision as well as the strength of the customer and partner community. And FY2019 is shaping up again and we expect it to be another record year for revenue and I think the innovation roadmap and opportunity positions us really well for future growth.","We appreciate all of you joining us today. Thank you.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call. Thanks everybody for joining us."],"631":["Adobe, Inc.

Fiscal 2019 is off to a strong start for Adobe as we delivered another record quarter in Q1. We achieved $2.60 billion in revenue, representing 25% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.36 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.71.","Adobe empowers people to create and transforms how businesses compete, a highly differentiated strategy that we continued to execute well on in Q1. Across all industries and geographies, we are helping customers large and small transform themselves and their businesses with Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud.","In our Digital Media business, we achieved strong revenue in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q1. Net new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR was $357 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q1 grew to $7.07 billion. Q1 Creative revenue was $1.49 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. Adobe Creative Cloud is democratizing creativity by delivering innovative new ways for everyone, from businesses to students, to creative professionals, to hobbyists, to tell their story. Our flagship digital imaging and video solutions, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro and After Effects, have long been the go-to tools for indie and feature filmmakers and editors.","At this year\u2019s Academy Awards, both Adobe Photoshop and After Effects received Scientific and Engineering awards for their contributions to the filmmaking industry. It\u2019s a tremendous honor for Adobe, and we\u2019re very proud of the product and engineering teams who contribute to the development and ongoing innovation in these iconic products. Most recently, Photoshop was used in the making of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which won this year\u2019s Oscar for Best Animated Film. Our photography business including mobile usage continues to show strong momentum. The number of Lightroom CC mobile subscribers has increased by more than 400% over the past year.","Beyond film and photography, Adobe is pushing the boundaries of creativity onto new canvases and broadening the appeal of Creative Cloud to entirely new segments of users. New media types, including 3D, video and augmented reality continue to emerge, which will enable more immersive and engaging digital experiences. In January, we acquired Allegorithmic, the industry standard in tools for 3D material and texture creation for gaming and entertainment. The addition of Allegorithmic further expands Creative Cloud into interactive content design and allows us to better equip video game creators, Visual FX artists working in film and television, designers and marketers, to deliver the next generation of immersive experiences.","Premiere Rush CC, our popular video editing app for social media creators, is expanding its footprint to Android, and was recently showcased at Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S10 event. We continue to innovate with Adobe XD, our solution for designing and prototyping Web sites and apps, adding expanded collaboration, prototyping and voice capabilities, all supported by a growing ecosystem of plug-ins and integrations with companies like Microsoft, Slack and Atlassian. We feel passionately that creative skills are a critical component for success across K-12 and higher education classrooms. We recently announced a partnership with the Royal Shakespeare Company in England. Together, we\u2019ll make new creative teaching resources and tools, including Creative Cloud and Adobe Spark, available to teachers, and to millions of students learning the works of Shakespeare in schools throughout the UK. This quarter we partnered with the California State University System to give students and staff at 21 campuses access to our full suite of Creative Cloud tools. Since Adobe launched Spark for Education in April 2018, over 7 million licenses have been provided to students and teachers worldwide. With Adobe Document Cloud, we\u2019re reinventing how people create, scan, edit, collaborate, sign and share documents, and leading the paper-to-digital revolution. Document Cloud revenue in Q1 was a record $282 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $856 million.","Overall momentum for Acrobat is fueled by strong demand for Adobe PDF among individuals and businesses worldwide. Our mobile footprint continues to grow. Adobe Reader and Adobe Scan downloads have now surpassed 600 million, and our partnership with Samsung contributed significantly to downloads of Adobe Scan in Q1. In addition, Adobe Reader is now available in the \u201cMade for Samsung\u201d section of the Galaxy App Store, increasing our potential reach to millions of Samsung smartphone users. We recently launched the \u201cPDF Like a Boss\u201d global advertising campaign to drive further awareness for new Document Cloud, Acrobat and Adobe PDF capabilities. Last month, we announced a partnership with the PGA TOUR, which will feature our new campaign in TV coverage for 10 tournaments this year. Adobe Sign has strong momentum and has become the e-signature solution of choice for organizations across all industries. We continue to enable resellers such as Nintex to sell Adobe Sign to thousands of partners, public, private and government organizations on their platforms.","In our Digital Experience business, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $743 million for the quarter, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. The success of our Digital Experience business is bolstered by several industry tailwinds: the mandate for enterprises and organizations to digitally transform their businesses, and the need to deliver the world-class end-to-end customer experiences consumers have come to expect. More and more businesses are choosing Adobe Experience Cloud, the industry\u2019s only end-to-end solution for marketing, advertising, analytics and commerce, serving both B2C and B2B customers.","Key Experience Cloud customer wins in the quarter include HSBC, NBC Universal, Bass Pro Shops and WebMD. Delivering exceptional experiences requires a lot more than tapping into a customer database to deliver a personalized email. Businesses need a full range of capabilities from creation through commerce and acquisition through renewal. For today\u2019s digital businesses, it\u2019s not enough to have data, you need the right data, behavioral, transactional and operational, to understand your customer and the intelligence to act on it in context. With our Adobe Experience Platform and breadth of Adobe Experience Cloud solutions, Adobe is enabling enterprises to achieve a unified, real-time view of their customers, and harness these insights to deliver engaging digital experiences.","Last year, we made several significant investments to further expand the range of capabilities we offer to Experience Cloud customers with the acquisitions of Magento, with its best-in-class ecommerce capabilities and Marketo, the leader in B2B marketing engagement. We\u2019re off to a strong start with both Magento and Marketo, and we\u2019re successfully integrating them into Adobe Experience Cloud. This is creating an unmatched value proposition for customers, and growing Adobe\u2019s addressable opportunity in the Customer Experience Management category. We are focused on product integration while driving acceleration of the Magento and Marketo businesses, leveraging Adobe\u2019s brand, enterprise sales and go-to-market organization, while maintaining a strong global footprint in the mid-market. With Magento, we are driving momentum by cross-selling our commerce offering to existing Adobe Experience Manager customers. With Marketo, we delivered our first integrated deployment of Adobe Experience Platform Launch, our tag management system. We are seeing strong interest from strategic Adobe accounts, many of which are B2C, who have significant B2B operations as part of a broader digital transformation strategy.","Industry analysts continue to recognize Adobe Experience Cloud as the market leader. This quarter, Adobe Experience Cloud was named a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms and once again achieved the strongest position in the quadrant out of 17 vendors for \u201cCompleteness of Vision\u201d. Our upcoming Summit in Las Vegas will be our largest to-date, and we will welcome the Marketo Marketing Nation community to the event. We are excited to share our Customer Experience Management vision, strategy and technology roadmap with our customers and partners.","At Adobe, our employees are our greatest asset and we are proud to have a brand that continues to be recognized for its innovation, progressive workplace practices and commitment to the communities in which we do business. For the third consecutive year, we were named one of Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies. Forbes recently recognized Adobe as one of its Best Employers for Diversity. And Fortune included Adobe on its annual Most Admired Companies in Software list again this year. Adobe is the clear leader in empowering people to create, and helping businesses transform to deliver the customer experiences needed to compete and win in today\u2019s competitive climate. These two tremendous market opportunities are fueling our business. With the world\u2019s best employees, customers and partners, we are well positioned for further growth and continued success in 2019. John?","John Murphy","Thanks, Shantanu. Our strong results in Q1 reflect a solid start to fiscal year 2019. As we discussed on our Q4 FY18 call in December, we provided targets for Q1 FY19 based on ASC 605. We are reporting results today based on our adoption of ASC 606 as required. Where applicable, we will call out differences in our results between 605 and 606 for comparison purposes against our prior 605-based targets.","In Q1 FY19, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.6 billion under 606, which represents 25% year-over-year growth when compared to $2.08 billion reported in Q1 FY18 under 605. Q1 FY19 revenue would have been $2.58 billion under 605, which represents 24% growth. Based on 606, GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.36 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.71. Based on 605, GAAP diluted EPS in Q1 would have been $1.31 and non-GAAP EPS would have been $1.65. This compares to our EPS targets based on 605 of $1.14 on a GAAP-basis and $1.60 on a non-GAAP basis.","Business and financial highlights in Q1 included: Digital Media revenue of $1.78 billion, including Creative revenue of $1.49 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $282 million; net new Digital Media ARR of $357 million; Digital Experience revenue of $743 million; exiting the quarter with deferred revenue of $3.22 billion; cash flow from operations of $1.01 billion; repurchasing 2.1 million shares of our stock through stock buyback; and approximately 91% of our revenue in Q1 was from recurring sources.","In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 22% year-over-year under both ASC 606 and ASC 605. The addition of $357 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $7.07 billion. Exiting Q1 ARR included an approximately $20 million cumulative adjustment from adoption of ASC 606. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year in Q1 and we increased Creative ARR by $292 million. Notable growth drivers in Q1 included: new customer acquisition across all offerings and geographies; subscription momentum and strength with Creative Cloud enterprise deployments; continued growth in emerging markets; ARPU increases, particularly in markets where price optimizations were introduced last year; and services adoption including continued momentum with Adobe Stock, which again achieved greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth.","We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $282 million in Q1, which represents 22% year-over-year growth, and we added $65 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. In addition to delivering another strong quarter with Acrobat and Document Cloud, some of the revenue strength in Q1 is attributed to a benefit from the move to ASC 606 revenue recognition. Notable drivers of Document Cloud growth include continued strength with Acrobat subscription adoption, helped by a steady on-ramp and conversion of free mobile app usage to paid subscriptions, strength with enterprise adoption of Acrobat and Document Cloud services, and strong performance with Adobe Sign.","In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record quarterly Experience Cloud revenue of $743 million, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. There were minor benefits from adoption of ASC 606, and year-over-year growth would have been 32% under ASC 605. Experience Cloud subscription revenue was a record $612 million. In addition to new revenue from our recent Magento and Marketo acquisitions, Experience Cloud performance in Q1 was driven by success across many offerings, with strength in Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager. Cross-sell of Magento within existing Experience Cloud accounts was notable, and Marketo delivered solid results in their first full quarter as part of Adobe.","Our Publishing segment, which includes OEM contracts, saw a sizable benefit from the move to ASC 606, and benefited from a large renewal deal in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $6.6 million. We had $8.5 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY19, versus $30.5 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY18. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $28.6 million.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.7 million. The $8.5 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY19 versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY18 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $7.2 million. In Q1, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 4% on a GAAP-basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter and 49 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $3.22 billion, up 25% year-over-year.","Remaining Performance Obligations, RPO, a financial measure required with reporting under ASC 606, was approximately $8.13 billion exiting Q1. RPO includes approximately $600 million of non-cancelable and non-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements. These funds do provide our customers options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses, or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products or services. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $3.23 billion, and cash flow from operations was $1.01 billion in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at a cost of $491 million. We currently have $7.35 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which goes through 2021.","Now, I will discuss our financial targets. We are providing ASC 606-based annual fiscal 2019 targets that reflect our Q1 results. In FY19: we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $11,150 million dollars; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.5 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 34%; Digital Experience subscription bookings growth of approximately 25%; a GAAP tax rate of approximately 10% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 11%; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $5.59; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $7.80. We anticipate Q3 and Q4 year-over-year revenue growth rates to be similar to the growth rate implied in our Q2 revenue target.","As in prior years, we expect summer seasonality which can lead to sequentially lower net new Digital Media ARR in Q3, followed by normal year-end strength in Q4. As the impact of lost deferred revenue due to purchase accounting from our acquisitions of Magento and Marketo tapers off during FY19 and as we grow our business, we expect quarterly operating margins to increase in the second half of the year.","In Q2, we are targeting: Q2 revenue of approximately $2,700 million dollars; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $370 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 32%; other Expense of approximately $36 million; tax rate of approximately 12% on a GAAP basis, and 11% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 495 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.20; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.77. As a reminder, Q2 continues to be impacted by lost deferred revenue and acquisition-related costs.","In summary, Q1 was a great start to what we expect will be another record year for Adobe. We look forward to seeing many of you at Summit. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, John. Adobe Summit is just around the corner.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks so much, and congrats on a good start to the year. If I'm limited to one question, my question is for John. John, how should we think about the impact of 606 on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year? Will it be a tailwind to both revenue and margins for each quarter relative to 605? Thanks.","John Murphy","Sure. No, I think as we have talked about at Analyst Day and further in December at our Earnings Call. Overall, 606 does not have a material impact to our results. What we're seeing in Q1 is the pull forward of revenue by recognizing some OEM contracts upfront that otherwise would have been recognized throughout the year. But otherwise we don\u2019t expect a material impact for the year.","Brad Zelnick","And if I could slip in a quick follow up. The $20 million ARR benefit from ASC-606. How does that split between Document Cloud versus Creative in the quarter? Thanks again.","John Murphy","So that was a cumulative catch-up adjustment against the $7 billion base of ARR. So really quite immaterial and the split that's really more in the Creative versus Document.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill","Shantanu, there were some questions about some of the promotional activity towards the end of the quarter. And I think then you noted that Creative Cloud ARR was more in line and historically you've been beating that number. So can you just talk to the promotional activity and what happened, was that just a coincidence at the end of the quarter, or is this just ongoing promotional activity you've seen historically that we shouldn\u2019t read too deeply into? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","The short answer, Brent, is you shouldn\u2019t read too deeply into it. The slightly longer answer is when I think about the business and the momentum that we saw across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud, it's clear we're off to a strong start. With respect to the Creative and Document businesses, specifically, we talked to you about the state of the art DDOM model that we have, the Data Driven Operating Model. And the fundamental strategy continues to be to acquire new customers. We're very aware of what is the activity that enables us to attract them, how we can make it a compelling event. But if you look at our success that we've had associated with attracting new customers to the platform, up-selling them, and if you look, Brent, also at the Q2 targets that we are providing, as well as the raise in ARR for the year, I think that should reflect the continued confidence and momentum that we have against the overall addressable market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Ross MacMillan","Just along the same lines I guess. Just if I pool $20 million of that cumulative benefit, I think your net new ARR would have been a little bit better than your initial guide. But then I look at your Q2 net new ARR guide, and it's certainly a lot better than I would have thought given that adjustment off of Q1. And I wondered if you could just maybe talk about why that second quarter guide is where it is and relative to Q1 and is there certain things you'd highlight? So for example, the price changes on international and Doc cloud, I think go into a full effect for the current quarter. But I was just curious as to that transition adjusting out the $20 million cumulative adjustments from Q1 to Q2. Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Ross, I think when we look at the business from a seasonal perspective, we do see traditional change between Q2 and Q1 that's been something that you can go back and look at fiscal '18 as well and you see the same trends. Remember in fiscal '18, there was that catch up as it related to the systems. So you see a nice growth in Q1 '19 over Q1 '18 and you see the same sequential change then if you look at it, whether it was in '18 or it was in '19. And I think where we continue to see momentum in the business, John, certainly alluded to some of those in his prepared remarks. Enterprise continues to do well. Mobile and the adoption of mobile continues to do well. Acrobat, we're seeing tremendous trend in the Acrobat business. If you look at the 22% revenue growth that we talk about, both in the Creative part of the business, as well as in the document part of the business, we're continuing to see that. And remember, in addition to new customer acquisition, there's a very significant installed base that exists with the perpetual version of Acrobat as we move them to the subscription offering. That's part of the reason why we're spending money in advertising and awareness of the new document cloud features. And this is the traditional, December slowing a little bit as it relates to the Creative, you start to see the momentum in the business. So, nothing different from what we've seen in past years.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Saket Kalia","Shantanu, just to maybe switch gears off of Digital Media towards Digital Experience. Given the change in management there with Brad Rencher moving on can you just talk a little bit about the search for his replacement and perhaps just as importantly how that organization can change structurally now with a bigger slate of things to sell and a bigger team?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes first, Saket, let me talk a little bit about the momentum that we're seeing in the business. I was actually with customers the last two weeks on the road in both U.S. and Europe. And all the meetings that you have, whether it's with CEOs, CMOs and CIOs, they're absolutely reflecting the urgency of digital engagement and an appetite really to work with Adobe, because we are viewed not just as a leader in the technology strategy part of it, but a company that can share results, lessons as a result of our own transition. So very pleased with the success that we saw in that business in Q1. I think it was 34% growth under the 606, 32% under the 605, so really strong part of that. And I think we highlighted as well the success that we're seeing with both Magento and Marketo; and so Magento, the integration with AEM and the success that we're seeing there; Marketo, which is the leader in B2B. So, fundamental market dynamics continue to be very favorable.","My immediate and direct involvement and frankly, the alignment of the entire DX organization that was previously matrixed at Adobe, the whole goal was intended to accelerate the momentum in what is very clearly a large and growing opportunity for Abode. And so, Saket, what we've done is we're actually integrating the two recent acquisitions quicker where appropriate, Magento and Marketo, to enable the synergies between the businesses. I touched on what was happening there. Operationally, Matt's been running the combined go-to-market. Abhay, has been running and helping us with the product roadmap. And so, I think the scale and the momentum of that business, that's now north of on a $3 billion run-rate, allows us the luxury of attracting world-class executives and growing internal talent. But net-net I would say the direct involvement that I have and the alignment of the entire organization is frankly allowing us to operate at a faster pace.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alex Zukin","I want to ask about the partnership with Microsoft and maybe just if you could give us an update on the impact that had on the digital experience business, and then maybe how you're thinking about that partnership given the Marketo and Magento integration as well?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, I mean, big picture, it's clearly one of the most successful partnerships we've had. I'll make a little bit of a plug for Adobe Summit for those of you are there, Satya, will be joining us on day two, and so on Wednesday. So I think you'll hear from him as well, his perspective on not just the current partnership and what we've been able to do, but some of the new opportunities that are emerging ahead of us whether it's ODI where we're continuing to make progress. And I think speaking for Adobe, we're certainly excited about the ability to have Magento and Marketo as well work on their cloud platforms. The current success is all based on what we've done with AEM, Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign. But the go-to-market alignment, I mean again, when I was on the road in Europe as I was mentioning as well as in America. Executives all around, the fact that they are all moving to a cloud-based environment for native applications and they see not just rhetoric but actual evidence of how Adobe and Microsoft have partnered to make our technology work together and for us to connect the desperate SaaS based systems. It's working. It's actually exceeded our targets. As I think we mentioned for '18, we expect the same success in '19.","Operator","Next question comes from the Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is now open.","Jennifer Lowe","So as we look at through the incremental investments into the business in terms of sales and marketing and R&D at this point. How much of that is going towards the traditional Creative business, the Document Cloud business versus the Marketing Cloud? And has that shifted at all, particularly in creative as you start to go on for a broader set of users or continue to expand?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Jennifer. And as you look at the OpEx and if you look at the margins, I mean just recall again the impact of Marketo and Magento. But big picture unless you're trying to get me in trouble with my product organization, I would say we see so much opportunity across each of the three businesses. And I think we're investing in all three. On the creative side certainly, we've touched on the new applications that are coming out on iPads. We've talked about the innovation in the fundamental desktop applications. We've alluded to with the acquisition of Algorithmic, our excitement around what we can do with immersive media. On XD, what we've done with respect to fundamentally changing the nature of collaboration and allowing people to collaborate in a meaningful way. We talked about some good partnerships there with Slack and Atlassian, in addition to Microsoft, the new voice enabled application.","So on Creative, there's absolutely significant amount of product innovation that's underway that\u2019ll be delivered to customers, Acrobat, what we are doing the strategy around delivering more functionality with verbs around documents, things that we've done with scan and create and sign. Document Cloud had a really successful business. And clearly with Experience Cloud, the delivery of the platform, I hope you're going to be at summit where we\u2019ll share more and show more. And I think underlying all of this, the investments that we're making in the core cloud infrastructure for us, to not only deliver value but over time reduce the COGs, because we're going to get more efficient there, as well as on AI and ML, so really comprehensive roadmap that exists against all of those, Jennifer. And given the opportunity, when you have a $100 billion addressable market, I think we've done a good job of balancing the long-term while continuing to deliver great value for shareholders.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Kirk Materne","Yes, thanks very much and congrats on a nice start to the year. Shantanu, you mentioned that that\u2019s running the combined go-to-market efforts for the Experience Cloud. And in your prepared remarks, you mentioned some good initial cross-sell of Magento. Can you just maybe remind us about how the go-to-markets is working right now? Are Adobe sales reps able to sell Magento and Marketo? Are you leaving those somewhat apart for now? Can you just remind me of how that playing out in the early stages and where you maybe have to have that size the end of the fiscal year? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","I mean, I think when we first acquired both Magento and Marketo, we had the field organizations a little distinct. They were part of the business unit as part of the -- as opposed to part of the field organization. What we've done is we've got a complete aligned pipeline generation right now for the entire Experience Cloud. And so the marketing initiatives, the partner initiatives and the organic sales initiatives, are aligned around getting a very healthy pipeline. And what we are doing is really now then with the enterprise sales force focused on delivering the entire value to the customers. I mean, so many of these customers are already customers of other Adobe solutions and so the ability to plug-in commerce and to plug-in B2B marketing directly into that pipeline. We had a really strong quarter with Magento in the enterprise segment. And while we're doing that, we want to make sure that the mid-market motion that exists globally is not impacted. And so I think having this really unified single message, single sales kickoff, I think is showing success. And Steve, who is CEO of Marketo and Mark Lavelle, they are helping us make sure that we understand the nuances of how to best market Magento and Marketo, but to leverage again, as I said, the Adobe brand. And so, having that one unified running the business is definitely accelerating the integration and presenting a very unified view to the customer.","Kirk Materne","Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Maybe the one other thing I would mention there is the number of partners actually having a single unified view is enabling us to get all of our existing partners in addition to I think as we said the hundreds of thousands of people on the Open Source community, having that all aligned enables us to paint a much bigger picture as well very quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Shantanu, I would like to ask you to comment on three internal programmatic initiatives that Adobe clearly seems to be investing in or ramping up, those being; first, retention, which you described at the MAX meeting as both the new growth; number two, monetization; and then thirdly, self-service, particularly EC. And if you could just comment on how you are looking at those generally and how any or all of those might be informing your guidance for this year and beyond?","Shantanu Narayen","Can you maybe just, before I answer, Jay, talk a little bit about the middle one? What did you mean by monetization? We are trying to monetize everything, so I just want to make sure I\u2026","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Yes. Well, what I'm looking at, for example, you're looking to bring people on that are specifically focused in the monetization area. I realized it's an ongoing thing. But it looks like something that you are incrementally focusing on, particularly in Creative Cloud and new services and Experience Cloud. I'm going off of some of the internal investments you seem to be making.","Shantanu Narayen","No, those are good questions. I mean, first on the retention. While retention is the -- and I still continue to believe that retention is the new growth. The focus there really has been a lot on engagement and understanding how people can get the value out of our products. I think you know we use our own campaign products to communicate with people. I think what Scott Brezski has done with what he described at MAX at the first mile initiative, which is when people first come on board how they can get advantage of our products. I think the integration with Adobe stock and enabling them to participate and not have the fear of a blank slate. And I would say the community and the hands and the success that we are seeing for people to get benefit of participating in the larger community, all of that is helping with the retention and that just continue to be ongoing focus for us. Because the more you retain, not only do you get the benefit of those customers they also serve as evangelists.","Spark -- the monetization side, I think the more we can get people at the early part of the funnel, whether it's coming in through mobile, whether it's coming with the reader and Acrobat and then converting them that just continues to be a way for us to get our brand out there, and certainly serving as a good funnel. The other area where we're seeing success there, Jay, is the fact the system approach that we are taking products like Light Room where you can use Light Room exactly the same on mobile or on a tablet or on a PC, the retention rates for products like that are certainly higher, because people are seeing more value associated with that. And the self-service, again, all about top of the funnel and making sure that we can get people to experience Adobe products that\u2019s certainly been part, I think the last number we probably shared was a 100 million IDs that we've been able to create. And going back to I think a question that may be Brent asked earlier. Certainly, we provide promotions to some of those people who otherwise may not have even made the lead from a fee product to a paid product. So I think the DDOM is where we continue to emphasize our internal effort to make sure that we are optimizing and delivering value at the same time.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","Question for John on the Experience side. I guess, a little challenge to try to understand maybe as we move pass all of the moving parts on deferred revenue write downs and acquired revenue and so forth. Could you help us understand what the business is growing either, if we were to look at all-in with everything part of the past year and the current year or if we were to maybe strip out some of the things we've acquired. It feels like we're working with numbers maybe in the mid-teens and the reported numbers are in the mid-30s, and there is a lot of room between I think for people to interpret how fast you maybe growing on the Experience side?","John Murphy","I think when you look at the Digital Experience business, it's a portfolio of solutions and services and products. And certainly, Magento and Marketo been the new additions to that provide an accelerated growth for the total Digital Experience business. So our target that we're really comfortable with -- in the combined because we're selling everything right now, so it's 34% for the year. We don't necessarily parse out what Magento is doing and what Marketo is doing, which gives us integrated sales approach at this point now. So for us, we're looking at the larger opportunity in the Digital Experience space as we talked about at the Analyst Day. And these new assets help us accelerate that opportunity. And then subscription bookings growth has been very strong and really pretty pleased with the performance this quarter and with the momentum that we have through the rest of the year.","Walter Pritchard","So, John on that, I mean, it doesn't feel like though we get pass the end of the year there we're going to be growing at 34%. That seems I guess I feel like people are going to mis-calibrate the model as they look forward at the growth rate. Any help as we look at it that way, I think that's the real confusion I think we get as we get the guidance and even the 606 impact?","Shantanu Narayen","I think, Walter, if you look at it taking a step back and you think about the book of business, I think the most app comparison is we take Magento, we take Marketo we bring it into the beginning of business. And when we say we're growing that book of business by 25% that's shows the growth of what is the core part of the business, mainly software as a service and licensing when you take the fact that consulting as a result of the partner ecosystem that exists is less of a focus for us. Hopefully, that gives you a sense of the underlying dynamics in that business and our excitement, because at the scale at which we are to continue to grow subscription bookings at that rate and to continue to expand, I think reflects the momentum we have.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Richard Davis","On the broad product line, so I realized that's hard to answer. But is there a way to think about the customer wins that you're getting and that are rip and replace versus new budget dollars, because I think you're getting both, right? I mean, there is more budget dollars going to marketing, tech and customer stuff but there is also rip replace. Is there a mix and how does that deal?","Shantanu Narayen","I would say when we look at 2018, we were doing a lot more of the existing customers. And we put a pretty good emphasis on new logos as well, that is really helping bring a lot more people. I think the whole B2B space that we had talked about now with the combination of Magento, and Marketo that's been good. But to your point, there's a fair amount of expansion within existing customers. And the expansion is coming from two different sources. The first is the expansion is coming from the cross sell of new products that we're acquiring into existing customers as people see the benefits of the integration. The upsell is also coming from more usage of the current products as they're seeing more efficiency gains and\/or additional benefits associated with it. So, we're pretty focused on all three of those. I mean you want to keep growing new logos and going after greenfield territory, I think we're getting more international expansion that continues to be new logos. But within accounts, we\u2019re very focused and in most of the accounts, we're very diligent about making sure as we look at a particular account, that we're not just measuring renewals but we are measuring growth in those particular accounts. And so hopefully that gives you some color of what it is. You're right. We don't break that out. I wouldn\u2019t know how to break that out frankly for a business this size. But internally, we're absolutely inspecting all three of those.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss","I think a question for John, just to get into the ASC 606 impacts. I just want to make sure I understand how it's impacted the guide. So if we look at Q1, you beat the original guide on Q1 by $0.11. It looks like about $0.05 of that came from the underlying fundamental on a like for like basis and $0.06 from ASC 606 impact, but the full year guide only moves by $0.05. So am I reading correctly that $0.06 benefit that you saw in Q1 on ASC 606, you see actually a headwind of you have a lower earnings, or is it negative impact throughout the year? And then related to that on the last quarter in Q4, you guys mentioned that you did expect to see sales and marketing benefits, and it wouldn't be much of the change to revenues at ARR, but you did expect to see sales and marketing benefits from different commissions. Does that still apply is there still that benefit that's coming through?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, I think maybe, Keith, I'll just start and then I'll certainly have John add more color to it. I mean, first big picture when we look at the momentum in the business, it just continues the way we had imagined. The way you have to think about it is you're right. I mean if you look at the 60 million above the guide that we had done, you also have to factor in that there was actually foreign exchange, there was probably a little bit more of a headwind. So we actually had a very strong quarter. What happens in some of the accounts as you're recognizing the revenue upfront rather than recognizing them rapidly and so that's part of the reason for how you should think about what might that also play out in Q2 for the same reason, namely deferred revenue. But in terms of how we looked at the targets for 606 for fiscal '19, we wanted to give you an update. It's early in the year. The business is doing well. On the ARR front, which has nothing to do with 606 or 605, moving forward, we were very clear about the success that we're continuing to have. And so that's part of the way we are doing it but we're excited about the business.","John Murphy","So I guess just to add on to that in relation to the sales and marketing benefit that we\u2019ve talked about last quarter, it's really because of the Marketo acquisitions so it\u2019s a slight benefit that we are seeing from the capitalized commissions related to the Marketo business. So you can see a little bit of that benefit here in Q1 and you look at OpEx under 605 and 606, and you will see that through the year. But certainly as Shantanu said, I think it's just being a little cautious in terms of how the rollout of the different contracts are in terms of upfront revenue versus recognizing the rest of the year.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking the question. This is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on XD and then just a question on how we think about the total TAM opportunity for that business. It seems like when you talk to partners and customers who use it, is this not UX designers, UI designers using it, but there are more developers also on the platform. And when you think about the total opportunity, both in terms of units and dollar, how do you think about it? And does XD provide you an opportunity to drive more enterprise wide adoption of your creative cloud?","Shantanu Narayen","When we think about XD, in particular, I mean I think the biggest picture message that I would send is we look at it and say everything is going to have a screen. And if everything is going to have a screen then it's going have digital content delivered to it, whether you are on your automotive, whether you are in a retail store, whether you are having a watch. We think XD is a perfect application to design, prototype and deliver content for all of those different devices. So it's not just UX designers it's certainly developers as developer breaking that designer, developer bridge that exist today to deliver great applications that's another use case. I think your question around enterprise is actually spot on. We are seeing a fair amount of success and adoption in the enterprise, because enterprises are standardizing on the collaboration between the marketing organization, the product organization and the engineering organization. We are seeing some good traction there. New apps like voice, that\u2019s certainly area where XD I think continues to shine. And so we are just excited.","I mean every time you see one of these new applications, you see both new app adoption among new customers. The monthly average usage of XD is growing very nicely and you certainly see that as an additional benefit to the full value Creative Cloud. And that\u2019s also true. I know you didn\u2019t ask the question, but when you think about algorithmic as well, it's the same thing. We start to attract a whole new set of customers with algorithmic. It gives us the opportunity to have a higher priced all apps bundle for people who are doing even more high-end work. And so both from a top of funnel acquisition as well as from optimization, that's how we think about each one of these different categories.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Tom Roderick from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Tom Roderick","So maybe just building on Keith's question that he just asked a little bit earlier regarding 606 and the impact to EPS, so just thinking about the second quarter, in particular. If I look at the full year, great guidance above where we all were for the second quarter, I think our models were a little bit heavy maybe by somewhere in the magnitude of around $0.10 $0.11. Can you just talk to some of the seasonal investments that might be taking place in addition to some of the 606 impacts that might have pulled some of that profitability forward just so get a sense of what's impacting that Q2 EPS guidance? Thank you guys.","Shantanu Narayen","I think part of it where you also have to factor in was the Q1 over-performance and the operating margin that we showed in Q1. So I wouldn't be surprised if some of you had modeled it where I think as I've looked at the models Q2 and Q3 where you were probably a little ahead of where the numbers were not fully understanding the Magento and Marketo, both impact of deferred revenue and the purchase accounting impact. And you were probably a little light on Q4 as it related to how we thought the year would play out. So I look at it and say, there is a little overachievement in Q1. We've guided to a good operating margins in Q2 based on the revenue that we have. And we've I think guided that Q3 and Q4, once the impacts of Marketo and Magento deferred revenue and purchasing accounting taper off then you're back to where you may have modeled it. But John, anything to add?","John Murphy","Yes, I think that's exactly right. We had said that the first half of FY19 was going to be more greatly impacted by the deferred revenue haircuts. And I think you're probably modeled a little more linearly in terms of returning it to the operating margin, and it really does actually accelerate towards the backend of the year. So we exit FY19 at rates that you typically see them our performance in the past.","Tom Roderick","And then as we get into FY20, just more standard seasonality not this upfront haircut that we got this year\u2026","John Murphy","That's correct.","Shantanu Narayen","That's absolutely correct.","Tom Roderick","Thank you and I appreciate it.","Mike Saviage","We're coming up in an hour here. We'll take two more questions, operator.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi thanks for taking the question. This is Tim for Mark. I wanted to talk a little bit more about ODI, and specifically if you could talk about where you guys are in the roadmap and maybe feedback that you've gotten from customers? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","I think the core strategy of ODI and three large companies getting together to say we're going to agreeing on the taxonomy, we're going to agreeing on an API and we're going to ensure interoperability between the data that exists today and silos. There hasn't been a customer that isn't excited about the fact that we're all stepping up to do that and allow enterprises to get value out of all of the data that they have in different silos. So I would say big picture first, there is a lot of excitement. It clearly builds on the progress that Adobe and Microsoft have made over the past few years as we've integrated PowerBI and campaign, or the work that we've done with AEM. I think you'll see at Summit having more people on the ingestion or ETL side also signup and say, they're going to enable all of this data that exists in silos to get normalized. I mean, the holy grail of what we are trying to do with ODI with a whole bunch of partners is to bring all of the data that exists into this real time stitched platform there is a common taxonomy. People don't care about where this data is stored, people care about can I action it in real time. And that is really the goal of ODI. We're making good progress. We'll share more at Summit. But the core value proposition really resonates with customers.","Operator","Last question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Earlier in the call, Shantanu, you mentioned the importance of adding customers into growth algorithm. So within Creative Cloud, I'm curious what is the biggest target of new users that you're still tapping into? And what ARPU or pricing are you getting on those customers versus what you've seen traditionally?","Shantanu Narayen","Sterling, there's so many different opportunities there. If I had to pick one, I would still say mobile, imaging and imaging is the area where there's the most. But what we've done with Premiere Rush, we talked about that. Spark having 7 million people and that being a real seeding ground for what we can do in education, I think that's very significant. The aura that comes from us doing high end work with AR and what we are doing with algorithmic. While the numbers may not be small, don't underestimate the importance of how that attracts the whole new generation of creators to our platform. But I would say imaging and PDF still continue to be the two largest areas of acquisition for new customers in the Creative Cloud. And I would highlight Spark as well only because Spark is this incredibly easy product that everybody from K-12 to teachers are starting to use and the more we get that standardized in school districts and frankly, in some cases entire countries as the platform of choice for education, I think that will continue to be a way in which we expose young creative talent to the joys of using Adobe products.","But sterling since you had the last question, let me just summarize by saying, I think when we think about the Q1 financial results. I think it's again, a clear reflection of the core strategy on the enterprise side, helping businesses transform on the content side, empowering people to create. That strategy resonates and our execution against that strategy continues to be strong. We think design and creativity have never been as important as they are today. And whether you call it digital transformation like you call it in the U.S. or digitization as it's called in Europe, it just represents an incredible opportunity for us to continue to grow and deliver value to our customers. We're excited about summit we hope we'll see a bunch of you there. One thing I'll also mention is that it actually integrates Marketo's Marketing Nation, so we're welcoming that community as well to Summit in a few weeks. And the targets that we provided I think reflect the momentum we continue to drive across all geographies. So Q1 was off to a great start. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone for joining."],"628":["Adobe Systems, Inc.

Q2 revenue was $2.20 billion dollars, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.33, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.66.","Adobe enables individuals, companies, governments and educational institutions to design and deliver transformative digital experiences, immersive, intelligent experiences that inspire, entertain, and drive loyalty and growth. The breadth of our product portfolio, the deep science embedded in our Adobe Cloud platform, the insights derived from the trillions of data transactions we process every year on behalf of our customers, and our global ecosystem of partners and developers have made Adobe the leader in enabling great customer experiences.","In our Digital Media business, we achieved strong growth in both Creative and Document Cloud revenue in Q2. We added net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR of $343 million, which grew total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 to $6.06 billion.","We continue to drive steady adoption of Creative Cloud subscriptions and services by individuals, teams and enterprises across all segments and geographies. This resulted in another strong quarter for Creative Cloud, with Creative revenue growing to $1.3 billion.","At Adobe, we believe everyone has a story to tell. Our strategy to empower more of the world\u2019s storytellers to express themselves depends on our ability to make our tools more accessible, enjoyable and invaluable to a broader set of creative customers, from creative pros, to hobbyists, to young creatives. Experience Design is one of our fastest growing creative segments and we recently introduced a new starter plan for Adobe XD, our all-in-one UX\/UI design platform. Adobe XD is the most modern, cloud-based solution available for designing, prototyping and collaborating with colleagues across multiple platforms. We recently announced several new integrations between XD and designers\u2019 existing workflows inside of tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator.","We launched a $10 million design investment fund to support designers and developers who innovate and push the boundaries of Experience Design.

These actions are part of our commitment to partner with educators, promote STEAM, and ensure art and creativity remain an essential part of education and professional development.","Adobe\u2019s video editing and production tools, including Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, are the gold standard for creating films and video from the silver screen to the mobile screen. At NAB, Adobe unveiled innovative updates to Creative Cloud\u2019s digital video tools. In addition, partners including Canon, RED Cameras, AMD, and Sony announced tools and updates that allow users to work in an integrated, collaborative production environment.","Our mission is to push the limits of creativity and storytelling while supporting exciting new mediums. We provided a sneak peek of Project Aero, a powerful new augmented reality, or AR authoring tool at Apple\u2019s WWDC last week. Project Aero is a system that makes it easier for designers and developers to create immersive content and bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.

GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.33 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.66. We drove strong performance across our product offerings and geographies during the quarter.","Highlights in Q2 included record Digital Media revenue, including Creative revenue of $1.30 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $243 million; record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million; net new Digital Media ARR of $343 million, and exiting Q2 with $5.37 billion of Creative ARR; deferred revenue growth of 27% year-over-year; cash flow from operations of $976 million; returning $589 million of cash to our stockholders through stock buyback; and approximately 89% of our revenue in Q2 was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 28% year-over-year. The addition of $343 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $6.06 billion exiting Q2.","Within Digital Media, we achieved another record quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 29% year-over-year in Q2 and we increased Creative ARR by $296 million. Several key factors helped drive this growth, including strong net new subscriptions across user segments and geographies, helped by robust traffic and conversion on adobe.com; continued momentum with Creative Cloud adoption in emerging markets; stable or increasing ARPU across key offerings, which continues to be driven by retention of users on promotional prices migrating to standard prices, as well as attachment of services in the enterprise and the recently introduced price increase in North America; and strong growth with Adobe Stock.","With Document Cloud, we achieved record revenue of $243 million, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. The performance in Q2 was driven by continued momentum with Acrobat subscription adoption as well as strength in the enterprise with Acrobat and Document Cloud services.","In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $586 million, which represents 18% year-over-year revenue growth. Subscription revenue grew 24% year-over year. Experience Cloud performance in Q2 was driven by success across our Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud and Advertising Cloud offerings. Experience Cloud data transactions grew to 97 trillion in the quarter, with 60% of Analytics transactions driven by mobile device usage.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $15.2 million. We had $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY18, versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q1 of FY18; thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $14.5 million.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $51.3 million. We had $0.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY18, versus $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 of FY17; thus, the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $38.3 million.","In Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 4% on a GAAP-basis and 5% on a non-GAAP basis. These rates are below the targets we provided due to a structural change we made during Q2 in how we serve foreign customers based on the new U.S. Tax Act. Our recent international tax structure change will benefit our tax rates for the remainder of FY2018 as well as next year.","Our trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 46 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.63 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $6.33 billion. Cash flow from operations was $976 million in the quarter.","In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $589 million. We currently have $900 million remaining of our $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. We expect this authorization to be exhausted by the end of this fiscal year. On May 21st, we announced that our Board had authorized an incremental $8 billion stock repurchase program through fiscal year 2021, which will be funded from future cash flow generation.","Now, I will provide our financial outlook. In January, we updated our financial targets to reflect provisions of the new U.S. Tax Act which became law during our fiscal Q1. The Tax Act affords companies like Adobe the ability to make changes to the way we serve our foreign customers with our international corporate structure. During Q2, we made a structural change and the effect of it results in even lower tax rates than we discussed previously for both this year and subsequent fiscal years.","In fiscal 2018, we anticipate an incremental 6 percentage-point reduction in our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates when compared to the rates we provided in January. We are now expecting a GAAP tax rate of approximately 7% in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2018; and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 5% in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal 2018. Our November fiscal year calendar and the timing of certain Tax Act provisions make our FY18 a unique year from a tax rate perspective. We indicated in January that we anticipated our tax rates would stabilize at a new rate of approximately 18% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis in FY19. Based on the structural change we made in Q2, we now estimate our tax rates in FY19 will stabilize at GAAP and non-GAAP rates of approximately 14%.","Turning to Q3 FY18, we are targeting revenue of approximately $2,240,000,000; Digital Media segment year over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 15%; tax rate of approximately 7% on a GAAP basis, and 5% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 498 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.27; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.68; and net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $310 million.","Our Q3 targets do not reflect our pending acquisition of Magento Commerce. We have received regulatory clearance and anticipate closing the acquisition next week. For the second half of calendar year 2018, Magento\u2019s internal plan projected achieving approximately $100 million in revenue. After the transition to Adobe\u2019s November fiscal calendar and the write-down of deferred revenue due to purchase accounting rules, we anticipate Adobe will report approximately $40 million of Magento revenue in the second half of Adobe\u2019s fiscal 2018, with approximately $10 million of it in our fiscal Q3. We expect the closing of Magento to be slightly dilutive to our Q3 GAAP earnings per share target. We do not expect the closing to impact our non-GAAP Q3 earnings per share target. In Q4, we anticipate normal seasonal strength and a strong finish to the year.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, John.","Adobe MAX returns to Los Angeles this fall, and Day One of our user conference is Monday October 15th.

We ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. Looking at the results, the revenue in Digital Media, both in the quarter and from the outlook is better than expected, despite the Digital Media ARR coming in line. I am wondering if there\u2019s something that\u2019s improving the revenue conversion in the quarters or some other factor that\u2019s allowing that to happen?","Shantanu Narayen","Sterling, I\u2019ll take that. I think, as we look at Digital Media, as you pointed out, ARR was again strong across all different segments. Retention continues to be in line with expect. Acrobat Perpetual had a good quarter. So, Acrobat, as it related to both licensing and perpetual was strong as well as Stock. So, I think across the board we continue to focus on converting ARR to revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alex Zukin","I wanted to ask on the Experience Cloud business, clearly showed some really nice acceleration in the quarter on a much tougher comp to last year. So, I wanted to ask if kind of what changes have you observed, what strengthening, renewal activity and up sell, any comments would be helpful and how sustainable do you expect some of these trends to be?","Shantanu Narayen","Alex, big picture, I think we\u2019re very pleased with our performance in the Experience business. I think, the metric that we look at a lot was the subscription revenue growth. If you look at the subscription revenue growth in the quarter, that was 24% year-over-year. I think in the prepared remarks we said, it was across the Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud as well as the Advertising Cloud. Again, digital transformation is front and center as an imperative for every single organization. Without a doubt, we have the clear leadership position in that. The value proposition is very unique. We\u2019re getting larger deals. We\u2019ve talked about the multi-solution opportunities that we have. I would say, particularly in the quarter as well, with the two summits that we organized and the interest that we have in summits, as closing opportunities for us. And last but not least, partnership with Microsoft where we\u2019re jointly going in and engaging with customers at higher levels. So, I\u2019d just point to continued leadership on the product and vision side and focus on execution in the quarter.","Alex Zukin","Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jeffries. Your line is open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Shantanu, just following up on digital experience, the first half of the year, you actually outpaced your yearend growth rate target and you have easier comps in the back half of this year. So, I\u2019m just curious in terms of why not take up your aspirations there? Is there something that\u2019s worrying you in the second half? Obviously, you\u2019ll have Magento layer in as well. So, are you just kind of waiting for that to layer in before you update your aspirations there?","Shantanu Narayen","I think, in terms of overall, as you know, Brent, we do not update our full year guidance. At this point, we\u2019re coming into what has been the Q3 seasonal quarter in Europe. But, the interest and the excitement or aspirations haven\u2019t diminished in any way. As you point out, it was a strong quarter. We have with Magento even more of a comprehensive offering and so, particularly remain excited. But it\u2019s -- I won\u2019t read anything into it except for the fact that we -- we did touch on the fact that Q4 will continue to be seasonally strong. So, should proceed as expected.","Brent Thill","And just a quick follow-up for John on ARPU. I think, last quarter, you said ARPU was kind of up across the board. I think now, you\u2019re saying flat to up. Given the price increases, can you just maybe parse that? And I know we\u2019re probably digging in on a metric that we\u2019re probably going too deep into, but any color there why that won\u2019t be up and up like we saw in Q1?","John Murphy","No. I think what we said is that it's stable and that we expect it to remain stable to up. So, also, I think it\u2019s really from our perspective a healthy metric. We don\u2019t guide to that or target externally but this really contributes to our ARR.","Shantanu Narayen","Maybe just adding color, Brent, on that as it relates to the enterprise licensing, nothing has changed, as we see enterprise licensing, we\u2019re certainly seeing good adoption of the full offering from the customized versions that we had said. As it relates to the price, since you asked that question, we always expected it to be marginal in terms of the impact associated with that. We\u2019re pleased with what we have seen so far in terms of whether it\u2019s people buying new subscriptions or renewal, where people see the price increase, I think that is very much in line with the additional value that we provided. So, on Digital Media, we continue to be excited about the opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from UBS. Your line is open.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up a little bit on subscription growth that you\u2019re seeing with Creative Cloud outside of the U.S. and in particular in geographies outside of the U.S., and I guess in two pieces. First, I think last year, one of the talking points was that Japan and Germany were still relatively early in the transition from on-prem to cloud. So, I\u2019m curious if we sort of have any update on the rate of the base migration there. And then, related as you think about subscriber growth in emerging markets, I\u2019m curious if you have sort of an update on how much of that sort of piracy conversion versus net new users to the base.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. Jennifer, I think globally, when we look at the demand for the creative solutions and specifically the cloud offerings, I think we\u2019ve stated that Japan and Germany and the other emerging markets were phase shifted from the United States and Australia where we first introduced the offerings on the learnings that we\u2019ve had about how to acquire customers and convert them whether they be new customers to the platform or as you point out former pirates. We have certainly learnt from that. We continue to think that the differential pricing that we have in countries like China as well as Southeast Asia is helping us. There is more creativity in those markets. So, Japan and Germany net-net continue to be good areas of growth for us moving forward. The emerging markets, both the piracy as well as the attractive upfront pricing are reasons why people are adopting the platform.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Brad Zelnick","Thank you very much and congrats on a great quarter. Shantanu, can you share with us, what the learnings have been from the price increase you introduced in North America this quarter and your observations on elasticity?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. I think, Brad, it\u2019s early. I would actually point to the learnings that we\u2019ve had from the foreign exchange changes that have happened in other countries and as a result of that what we have done with respect to pricing. Our strategy continues to be how do we get more and more people on the platform. And so you know, we continue to attract new customers with attractive pricing. And during the first year, the more engagement that we have with them, the more they are likely to add the standard pricing continue in renewal. And so, renewal continues to be an area of focus for us. And again, the goal for us right now is attracting new customers to the platform. Everything we\u2019ve done with respect to price changes has not impacted retention. And so, we continue to focus on that blend, if that makes sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Saket Kalia","Shantanu, realizing that it still has to close, can you just talk about initial customer feedback on Magento? It\u2019s been a few weeks. And any early ideas, broad brushes that you can share with us on how the business can look different as part of the Adobe family, post closing?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Saket. I mean, I think, despite the fact that we already had integrations with commerce systems, we had clear ask from our customers for a complete Adobe solution from content creation to delivery to analytics and now all the way out to commerce. What we are particularly excited about is the investment that we\u2019ve made in the Adobe Cloud platform provides a clear architecture and a playbook for us to integrate new acquisitions like Magento, seamlessly.","We were attracted by a few things when we looked at Magento, great people, great technology. But I think what\u2019s unique was that they targeted both digital and physical goods as well as B2B and B2C in terms of the customer segments. And Mark, who is their CEO, did a great job of leading them after they transitioned out of eBay. While their traditional strength has been in the mid market and departments or single geographies where large enterprises use them for commerce in one geography and then translate it, I think that will continue to be an area of good opportunity for us. And what we will bring to that is the enterprise relationships that we have with larger enterprise. So, like all our acquisitions, we look at it from the point of view of can we accelerate their growth, does it fill out our offering that we have a unique and differentiated solution. And the good news was, Magento, I think checked all of those boxes. And so, we\u2019re excited about it, as we said, hopefully it closes next week. And we\u2019ve given you some transparency into the size of their business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Mark Moerdler","Congrats on the quarter. And thanks for taking my question. So, I\u2019m going to follow-up on the questions on Magento. Discuss how Magento has had strength in selling the digital goods Adobe\u2019s -- digital marketing is all about digital marking but both digital and electronic. How big a nuance, how big a difference is there, how big an opportunity is there? The fact that they are so strong in selling the digital goods and how does that play into the existing customer base that Adobe has in digital marketing?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. Mark, I think from our point of view, we just want a very comprehensive solution. When you go into a retail customer, for example with Digital Experience who is making available for sale physical goods, we say, yes, we have the ability for you to transact and finalize your sale for physical goods that\u2019s shipping. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are in shipping our sales, but the ability to have that inventory, the building materials, the payment methods is clearly an advantage in terms of them taking non-digital way of transacting commerce and converting it to commerce. What\u2019s also nice about them is for people who want to do rooms or airline reservations or other digital ways of transacting business, the same solution scales from physical goods to digital goods. Things like subscription, what Adobe offers. I think, we would all acknowledge that more and more companies want to get to a subscription mechanism. And so, I think, I would look at it more as a comprehensive way of dealing with anything that needs to be transacted online, whether the end result was a physical good or digital good or subscription, being able to have a comprehensive offering across B2B and B2C is really helpful. And what I mean by B2B is you might have companies whether they\u2019re consumer goods companies or companies that are actually shipping to other retailers who also want to use this to transact business electronically. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting for us about what Magento offers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Shantanu, congrats on the quarter. You look like you\u2019re tracking again this year to something around 1.3 billion of net new Digital Media ARR. And we\u2019re just coming up into a period where you\u2019re starting to move on price, you have some new product introductions, there are some ARPU effects from Stock. Just philosophically, how do you think about the progress of that net new ARR, as we think about that, no just this year, but broadly speaking over the next two or three years? And do you feel like there are levers that you have to manage that number to a sort of target? And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for sustainability on that line item. Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Ross. Again, when we look at the ARR accomplishment and entire Digital Media performance in the first half, it\u2019s very clear that we continue to have momentum across all of the various offerings, as well as geographies. I think, if you look at our Q3, and then I\u2019ll get to the picture, we do expect Q3 is seasonally weak. And we\u2019ve said that we expect the traditional strength in Q4. One of the things that we are discontinuing to monitor in Q3 is what\u2019s happened with GDPR and the recent privacy law changes is that everybody who is doing business online in Europe, will have to make sure that GDPR is not sort of just the checklist item but a new ways of doing business which requires people to tailor their digital marketing. We were ready with that on May 25th. We just want to continue to monitor that as we transact business online. We are best-in-class both for ourselves as well as for the service that we deliver for our customers. And so, we look at the 310 million target for ARR; it\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve actually had in Q3 for Digital Media. To your point, it should result in record ARR addition in this business for FY18. But long-term, as you think about new media types, as you think about devices, what we are doing across education, immersive media opportunities with AR and VR, screen design, video and the explosion of video, I think, you\u2019ll continue to see us innovate more, attract new customers to the platform, and really drive the addressable opportunities. So, that\u2019s really is the focus for us in that business.","Ross MacMillan","And just a quick follow-up, if I can, for John. Welcome, just on the tax rate that new run rate of 14%, is that something that in the absence of material geographic revenue mix shift or M&A, is that something that you would view as broadly a sort of stable run rate, even beyond fiscal \u201819?","John Murphy","Yes. Thanks, Ross. I think, how I would describe it is with the new Tax Act, we\u2019ve been digesting the different impacts to that. And so, you see as we made this recent change, again after just starting in January. So, we do feel this rate is stable, but we continue to evaluate opportunities with the provisions of the tax law. And just to remind you, our fiscal year \u201818 is really unique for us. So, we don\u2019t have the full effects of the Tax Act until FY19. But I think you can rely on those rates at this point, to be relatively stable. And then, as we continue to evaluate opportunities, take advantage of the provisions, we can update them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Shantanu, a technology roadmap question for you regarding Digital Experience. How much of a role do you think there may ultimately be for you to have a self-serve model in the portfolio in digital experience, paralleling what you\u2019ve done with Digital Media, particularly with adobe.com. The reason I\u2019m asking is was the launch of Advertising Cloud Creative at Summit for instance perhaps an early sign of a longer term ambition for more comprehensive self-serve capability that you can deliver to customers for Digital Experience. If that\u2019s so, would there then be positive incremental margin implications, as you\u2019ve seen on the Digital Media side from that kind of a model?","Shantanu Narayen","I think, Jay, there is no question that a focus on time to value and getting more practitioners adopting our digital experience solution sooner rather than later is a priority for us. We\u2019ve certainly, to your point, done that with Acrobat and CC. Magento is a really nice addition to that, because if people can create a website, start doing it with their customers through multiple channels and transact business through commerce, that opens up new vistas for us. And if you remember, the original Day Software as well as what Omniture had, actually targeted small and medium businesses. So, I look at it as, are we focused on continuing to drive time to value and getting more practitioners to be self served. That\u2019s only a benefit in terms of their NPS with Adobe. And it\u2019s clearly an area of focus for us.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","A quick one for John. Could you talk about the implications for cash flow from the new cash structure, both in terms of not just net income, which is obviously going to be affected on the GAAP side but also perhaps in terms of deferred tax implications within cash flow?","John Murphy","Clearly, we benefit from the tax rate changes. And I think what we\u2019ve demonstrated is that our business continues to throw cash flow strength in growth. So, I would just say that that trend is pretty consistent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Just a further question around pricing. You\u2019ve talked about services for some time and stock I think continues to do well. Can you help us understand how services are impacting pricing versus some of these other factors, especially the price increase that just started to have impact this quarter, maybe a stack rank or kind of relative conversation about the drivers of ARPU?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Walter. I mean, I think as it relates to Adobe Stock, that is clear service. It makes the entire offerings sticker. And I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks that Stock had a very strong quarter, I think it continues to make the whole aspect of an on-ramp to creativity easier. So, that\u2019s been good. I would say in the enterprise in particular as people are finding that whether you\u2019re interfacing between freelancers and the marketing or graphics departments within enterprises, storing all of these assets, so that you can increase content velocity, things like Adobe Sign, all of them are causing us to be able to both deliver better value and charge more to our enterprise customers. So, in the enterprises in particular, we\u2019re very maniacally focused on named user deployment, ensuring more people use it within an enterprise, having services be the win, which they can engage more people in the creative process. And that\u2019s leading to both greater ARPU as well as new seat deployment within the enterprise.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","I just had a question about, as we look at your revenue targets, Shantanu, and as you look out a few years, is there a reason to think that the pace of expense growth, which we\u2019ve been seeing, would change at all? You guys have done such a great job kind of growing expenses at such a much lower pace obviously than revenue. I am just wondering if there is any reason to think that kind of the pace of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of expense growth would change based on what your revenue plans might be down the road.","Shantanu Narayen","That\u2019s a great question, Heather, in terms of how we think about it. And I think as a company, we\u2019re just being ruthlessly focused on both top line and bottom line growth. I mean you are driving 24% year-over-year growth in revenue, but driving 60% growth in non-GAAP EPS, I think it shows that we\u2019re really focused on both of those. We just have some very significant opportunities. And I think as you think about Q2, maybe there were a couple of investments in the Adobe Cloud platform as well as in preparation for GDPR that were factored in. But I think long-term, we just continue to ensure that are we driving great top line growth at a very profitable margin, and we\u2019re going to continue as we did in Q1, for example, all revenue overachievement will result in greater earnings and that continues to be our focus.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI, your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Shantanu, I was wondering if you could just -- I want to go back to Magento again. And could you just walk us through I guess how you\u2019re thinking about the integration? I assume given the time of your fiscal year, it\u2019ll operate generally on a standalone basis. But, is this a product that the Adobe sales force can start taking to market once the deal closes? I guess, just how are you thinking about sort of integrating, I guess mainly from a go to market perspective once the deal closes over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Kirk, I think, the sales force is already chomping at the bits in terms of saying how do we, once the deal is closed, have Magento in our bag. It\u2019s such a natural extension. But, I think to your point, our focus has always been with acquisitions, do no harm, really make sure that we can continue to bring to bear the Adobe brand, bring to bear the customer relationships that we have and truly understand the magic sauce that makes them so special. So, certainly, in terms of from day one when we are closing being able to expand our story of how we can serve customers, looking at some of the customers. And I think we pointed that out in the introductory call in terms of who they already have as customers. So, I think, we will start to deliver to enterprises but we will be a little cautious because we just want to make sure that we have discipline on-ramp to that particular product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Derrick Wood","Great, thanks. I wanted to touch, drilling in on GDPR. And one could argue, it could have some mixed impact for you guys. The regulation focuses on data minimization in terms of the amount of content companies should be storing about their end consumers and email lists have to be more scrutinized. And I guess that could weigh on capacity subscription sales. But at the same time, companies are needing to put more governance and workflow around their digital engagements and we could see more standardization and more usage on the Adobe platform. You clearly had a good quarter, but how do you see these dynamics around GDPR working out and impacting the demand trajectory on Experience Cloud.","Shantanu Narayen","When I take a step back, Derrick, the trend towards online businesses and digital spend and the desire on the part of enterprises to understand attribution is only going to increase. More money is going to be spent digitally but the bar of how that\u2019s being spent and the understanding and effectiveness of that marketing and spend is only going to increase. And I think big picture, we look at that as a big opportunity for Advertising Cloud, because not only are we a channel for the major online marketing platforms like search, social, display and TV, but we are unique and that we have sort of the broadest perspective of efficacy across all marketing expense.","On the second side, all companies will need to balance the customer acquisition where this third-party data plays an important role. And the more important issue for all companies is going to be customer engagement, to your question around email list and how you engage with them. And then, I think leveraging the first-party data is going to become even more crucial. And so, we look at it and say we have the best of both worlds. The Advertising Cloud will continue to focus on helping customer acquisition, but really the energy is going to be spent by companies more on Marketing Cloud where engagement is going to be even more critical in this world of GDPR, so that you don\u2019t in any way impact the trust that you have built with companies. And I actually think analytics also across both acquisition and engagement will become even more critical in this new environment. So, you\u2019re right in that we have to help our companies navigate it and you\u2019re right. And I think long-term, it just continues to be a tailwind as the leader in this business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Weiss","I just had a clarification question around the guidance. Last quarter, Mark Garrett was talking about Digital Media ARR and talking about Q3 and Q4, the expected seasonality of Q3 and Q4 to follow similar to what was achieved in FY17. And when I look at ARR from last year, Q2 to Q3 was pretty sort of flat seasonality. It looks like we are looking for closer to like down 9% to 10% this year. Is something changed between sort of Mark Garrett\u2019s comments and sort of how we are thinking about ARR into Q3 this quarter?","Shantanu Narayen","No, Keith. I think, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, when you look at from an absolute perspective, the Q3 target that we provided for ARR will still be the largest that we have. I think we continue to see strength in the business and nothing\u2019s changed from that particular quarter. I mentioned briefly that we want to just make sure that we get a little bit more experience with what\u2019s happening with GDPR to Derrick and other peoples questions associated with what\u2019s happening online but in no way reflects a change in how we see the business. And Q4 again, we expect the traditional strength in the business.","Keith Weiss","So, some caution perhaps around GDPR, potentially questioning some Digital Media business from Q3 into Q4?","Shantanu Narayen","I think, we look at it from first half second half and we still continue to model it, but you can look at it as we just want to make sure that we underpin GDPR in more detail across Q3. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan","Shantanu, I\u2019m just curious, if you look at companies like in your peer groups Microsoft, Intuit, they have had revenue growth in some of the key businesses outpace unit growth. Obviously, pricing and ARPU growth has been a key trend of the industry. I\u2019m curious how you think about that. Are you at a point where it\u2019s more so ARPU growth versus unit growth? If so, what is driving that? If you on the contrary believe what you said, on the previous earnings conference call that the TAM is a multiple of the previous cycle. I was curious to hear you elaborate on why you believe the TAM as a multiple of the prior cycle. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. I mean, I think when we look at the two businesses where we have a B2C business, when we look at Acrobat and units growth for Acrobat, all the strength in the Document Cloud businesses is being driven by unit growth rather than what you would call ARPU growth. When we look at customer acquisition in Creative Cloud, we\u2019ve been pretty forthcoming about how it\u2019s really being driven by few people coming to our platform. And so I can\u2019t comment on what Microsoft and Intuit are saying, but from our point of view, it\u2019s certainly being driven not more by few customer acquisitions and focus on that. And so, as we thing about big picture, what we are focused on in creative, the first is let\u2019s just continue to drive net new subscriptions, focused on retention, the pool is becoming larger and larger. So, this is in emerging markets. I would say a little bit more adjacent markets, what we\u2019ve done with education and hobbyists. We continue to make sure that ARPUs are increasing as people go into renewals. But price is not on that first list of things that we\u2019re focused on, given where we\u2019re in the cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens from JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Pat Walravens","Shantanu, I\u2019m going to step back a little bit. And I\u2019m curious how far -- I'm sorry, the artificial intelligence side of things. How far away are we from having Sensei help customers search video content with a high degree of accuracy, Sensei find all the footages that has Brad Pitt in it.","Shantanu Narayen","Pat, I think if you look at what we already have with respect to Adobe Stock, the two things that I would call Adobe magic that Sensei has provided is first auto tagging. So, you can actually get thousands of pictures and we have the ability based on the prior data set to be able to tag it and infer intent. And so, you can search. And the economical example we give us fire engine versus being it called different things in different countries. And so, we already have that. With video as well I think we have the ability across frames to do searching. And so, it\u2019s only going to get better and better with the data sets. But that data is not far in terms of being able to find across video. And in fact, we have already demonstrated abilities to do search on video.","Mike Saviage","Operator, we\u2019re coming up on the hour. Why don\u2019t we take one more question, please?","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal. Your line is open.","Brian Wieser","I was wondering if you could offer a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing with Advertising Cloud. You called it certainly as supporting some growth there. And we see some of the peers to that business in particular doing phenomenally well. And related GDPR, as we\u2019re seeing something with shake out with much of the ad tech sector, I\u2019m wondering if you see opportunities for deeper investment. It seems like anyone with deep pockets a long time horizon is maybe well-positioned to take advantage just growing organically or by picking up businesses that are now available.","Shantanu Narayen","We had a good strong revenue quarter for Advertising Cloud in Q2. I think if you look at our overall revenue growth of 18%, it was certainly higher than what we had guided to. Advertising Cloud played a role in that. I think, to your point, we are one of the few companies that has the brand to have the ability for people to invest across search, social, display and all forms of TV. And so, I think, we\u2019re pretty uniquely positioned. I think what\u2019s even more unique about our offering is the tie-in to the segmentation that we have with audience manager and the analytics that we provide on the efficacy of the spend. So, we continue to be excited about the opportunity that we have both in Advertising Cloud as a separate cloud an opportunity, and the integration of that across the entire Experience Cloud.","And since Brian that was the last question, in close, the momentum in our business clearly continued in Q2. We continue to be excited about the product roadmap that we will deliver in the second half and the innovation agenda. Big picture, the strategy of empowering people to create, as well as helping businesses transform, continue to be large addressable markets with good tailwinds, and we continue to focus on driving both top-line and bottom-line growth with significant margins while we invest in technology as a long-term differentiator for Adobe.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Adobe Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen, as well as Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO.","In the call today, we will discuss Adobe's third quarter fiscal year 2012 financial results.

The audio and archive may not be rerecorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. At Adobe, we're focusing on 2 large market opportunities: digital media and digital marketing. Our results in Q3 demonstrate both our market leadership and momentum in these businesses. In our digital media business, we're transforming the way people create, publish and monetize their content across devices, and our pace of innovation has never been faster. The global Creative Cloud launch in May broke new ground. Through attractive subscription pricing, new cloud services and frequent product and feature enhancements, Adobe is changing how we deliver value to a broader set of customers.","Response to Creative Cloud has exceeded our expectations. After only 4 months since its introduction, we have approximately 200,000 paid Creative Cloud subscriptions. In addition to paid subscriptions, we offer an on-ramp to Creative Cloud through free memberships. We now have over 300,000 free members, and they represent a significant funnel for driving future paid subscribers.","We expect adoption to accelerate as we deliver constant innovation exclusively to Creative Cloud members. Since we've launched Creative Cloud, we've enhanced the offering to include Lightroom and Digital Publishing Suite, Single Edition and added new features to products like Illustrator. Coming soon are enhancements to Photoshop and Dreamweaver.","Next Monday, we're hosting a Create the Web event in San Francisco that will showcase our latest innovations around HTML5 products, which will also be included in Creative Cloud.","Our success thus far has been through Creative Cloud for individual users. Over the next few months, we will introduce new offerings for teams and enterprises which significantly expand the market opportunity for Creative Cloud. In November, we will launch Creative Cloud for teams, which will enhance collaboration and simplify the setup, management and administration for creative workgroups. Next year, we will deliver an enterprise version of Creative Cloud targeted at companies who wish to deploy and provision Creative Cloud across large organizations with a scale similar to the enterprise license agreements we have for Creative Suite today. Creative Cloud for enterprises will integrate with our Digital Publishing Suite and the Adobe marketing cloud offerings provided through our Digital Marketing Suite. Creative Cloud for teams and enterprises will be made available through our channel partners as well as directly from Adobe.","Today, we added Adobe Digital Publishing Suite, Single Edition, a service for individuals using Creative Cloud. At the enterprise level, we continue to drive strong adoption of Digital Publishing Suite. Nearly 1,100 customers are now using DPS worldwide to reach their readers with digital editions, up from 850 last quarter. These customers are now distributing 125,000 digital editions on average every day to iPads and other devices with over 40 million delivered to date. This quarter, we added Time Inc., which has signed an agreement to move its magazines over to Adobe DPS.","In digital marketing, we drove 40% year-over-year revenue growth with our Digital Marketing Suite. Annual Digital Marketing Suite revenue is expected to exceed $750 million this year, making Adobe the clear leader in this exploding category. In Q3, we closed Digital Marketing Suite business with customers such as American Airlines, American Express, Nintendo, Toyota and Shutterfly.","Adobe Digital Marketing Suite enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization. These solutions are built on our leading content management and data analytics platforms. We deliver over 460 billion marketing campaign assets a year, measure over 6 trillion transactions a year on the web and manage 27 petabytes of data for our customers. We are the big data company for marketeers.","In addition to leading in marketing analytics, we are now the recognized leader in web content management. Last week, Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its web content management Magic Quadrant report, making Adobe the only vendor identified as a leader in all 3 major industry analyst reports.","Earlier this month, we delivered Adobe Social, the newest addition to our Digital Marketing Suite. Adobe Social's unique differentiation is enabling companies to tie their social marketing efforts to measurable business results, leveraging our data analytics platform. Adobe Social enables marketers to create and publish communications through social channels, get insights from their communities, measure results in real time and manage their social engagement programs. It integrates with leading social platforms such as Facebook and Twitter.","We will continue to drive leadership in the digital marketing category, utilizing advantages that only we have. Adobe has a unique relationship with marketing customers, thanks to our creative design history. Our solution integrates content and data, analytics, personalization, web experience management, campaign management and social capabilities in a way no other industry player can touch.","We have the largest portfolio of digital marketing customers, representing leading brands in the world, including all of the top 10 retailers and top 10 auto manufacturers, 9 of the top 10 global media companies and 7 of the top 10 banks.","And most importantly, Adobe has the most compelling vision for the future of digital marketing. We will engage our digital marketing customers across all aspects of their business, extending from their use of Creative Cloud to how they manage, deliver, measure and monetize their content with Adobe marketing cloud.","Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed discussion of our Q3 results. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. This is an exciting time to be the CFO of Adobe. We have a focused strategy, and we are executing well against that strategy, transforming our business and setting the company on a path for a higher long-term growth rate with a large recurring revenue stream.","In addition to briefly commenting on our Q3 results, I'm going to spend some additional time today discussing our Creative Cloud results and the positive effect it is having on our business model. Understanding this transition and where we are in the migration of our customers to a subscription model will help in understanding our Q3 results, give context for our Q4 financial targets and set up our discussion on how to begin to think about fiscal 2013.","In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,081,000,000. Driving these results was overachievement of Creative Cloud subscriptions and strong Digital Marketing Suite revenue. In Q3, we added approximately 8,000 Creative Cloud subscriptions per week, exceeding the 5,000 subscriptions per week we assumed in our targets. This overachievement in subscriptions effectively transitioned approximately $29 million more perpetual revenue to Creative Cloud than expected. In addition, currency impacted Q3 revenue negatively by approximately $9 million. Adding both of these back to our reported results would have put third quarter revenue toward the high end of our targeted range.","We continue to manage expenses appropriately. Q3 GAAP operating expenses were $682.7 million compared to $688.4 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q3 were $592.2 million compared to $611.7 million last quarter. This yielded diluted earnings per share in Q3 fiscal 2012 of $0.40 on a GAAP basis and $0.58 on a non-GAAP basis. In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 23.5% on a GAAP basis and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis, in line with the targets we provided for the quarter.","Geographically, our Q3 results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: the Americas, 52%; Europe, 27%; Asia, 21%. We experienced stable demand in the U.S. and Asia and continued softness in Europe during Q3.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $21.8 million. We had $7.7 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '12 versus no hedge gains in Q3 FY '11. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $14.1 million.","From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $5.8 million.  Considering the $7.7 million in current quarter hedging gains versus the $10.7 million hedging gains we had in Q2 FY '12, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue was $8.8 million.","Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 10,811 versus 10,474 at the end of the last quarter. The sequential increase was driven by hiring in R&D as well as in our field organization.","Our trade DSO was 48 days, which compares to 50 days in the year-ago quarter and 43 days last quarter.","During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $263.3 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.25 billion compared to $3 billion at the end of Q2.","Our ending deferred revenue balance decreased by $32.5 million to $560.3 million. This decrease is typical in the quarter following a major desktop product launch. Free-of-charge upgrade recognition from the CS6 launch builds short-term deferred revenue during the launch quarter and is recognized as revenue in the quarter following a launch, causing the decline. In addition, our Digital Marketing business invoices customers on the first day of each calendar month, and the timing relative to our quarter end caused some of the sequential decline. As a reminder, Creative Cloud subscriptions are billed monthly and are essentially not reflected in deferred revenue on the balance sheet.","In Q3, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares at a total cost of $76.1 million.","I will now discuss Adobe's key business segment results. Digital Marketing segment revenue in Q3 was $257.1 million compared to $211.7 million in Q3 fiscal 2011 and $250.9 million last quarter. Within the Digital Marketing segment, we achieved record Digital Marketing Suite revenue of $192.4 million. This represents annual growth of 40%. Mobile device use continues to be a driver in this business. Mobile transactions increased to 18% of the 1.6 trillion SiteCatalyst transactions in the quarter, up from 17% last quarter.","Turning to the Digital Media segment. Revenue in Q3 was $769.1 million compared to $745.9 million in Q3 fiscal 2011 and $818.4 million last quarter. The 2 major components of revenue in our Digital Media segment are our Creative family of products and our Document Services products.","Document Services products, consisting of the Acrobat family as well as the new cloud-based services such as EchoSign, had a solid quarter. We achieved Document Services revenue in Q3 of $185.5 million, driven by continued Acrobat adoption in the enterprise as well as strong growth in EchoSign and related Acrobat cloud services. Looking to Q4, we are excited about the next major release of Acrobat, which will ship late in the quarter.","Now, as promised, I'd like to provide more insight on our Creative product results. The goal of Creative Cloud is to deliver more value to customers, which will drive higher revenue growth that is more predictable. During the transition, we measure performance as a combination of perpetual revenue recognized up front and the number of our paid Creative Cloud memberships that is recognized ratably.","We've highlighted frequently that 2 additional goals with Creative Cloud are to attract new customers to our offering and keep our existing customers more current on the latest release. As we track against these objectives, it's important to understand where we are in the phased delivery of different versions of Creative Cloud.","Creative Cloud for individuals shipped in May, and individual users represent the vast majority of Creative Cloud members today. We intend to release Creative Cloud for teams this quarter, which will be targeted at groups of users in small and medium businesses as well as departments in larger companies. In 2013, we intend to deliver an enterprise offering that is subscription based and will supplement how we engage large customers who today license Creative products via volume licensing agreements.","Combined, all of these offerings will help us achieve the goals we set forth at our analyst meeting last November, including 10% unit growth in fiscal 2012 and accelerated new customer acquisition. Our research shows that approximately 40% of subscribers paying list price for Creative Cloud in Q3 were new to the Adobe Creative product family.","On a regular basis, we intend to provide insight into key data points which will help you understand and model our transition to subscription. Some of these metrics will fluctuate with product mix from quarter-to-quarter. In Q3, all of our key subscription run rates and metrics increased and exceeded our expectations. We added more than 100,000 net new subscriptions, and we exited Q3 with approximately 200,000 total paid subscriptions.","As I said earlier, we achieved an average of 8,000 new subscriptions per week in Q3. Entering the quarter, we expected an average of approximately 5,000 subscriptions per week. In Q3, 86% of subscribers chose annual subscription over month-to-month terms. This grew from 75% that chose annual in Q2. In addition, 75% of subscribers chose the full Creative Cloud offer over point product options in Q3, up from 65% last quarter.  Our average revenue per user per month was $37 in Q3, up from approximately $36 we achieved in Q2.","97% of subscriptions were ordered through adobe.com. Anyone trying to do channel checks by calling contacts in the distributor and reseller channels to understand the status of CS6 and Creative Cloud for individuals should balance the findings of those checks with the knowledge that a mix shift is happening.","The introductory $29.99 per month promotion has proven to be an effective strategy for onboarding existing customers into Creative Cloud, and we decided to extend it beyond August. We believe that once users try Creative Cloud and see the value it gives them over the perpetual offer, they will stick with Creative Cloud after the monthly price resets to $49.99 after the first year.","We continue to build a healthy pipeline for potential Creative Cloud paid subscribers through marketing programs, trial downloads and free memberships. Getting prospects into the marketing and conversion funnel is therefore a key part of the strategy to drive the transition to subscription.","Now let's look at revenue and the financial model of the subscription transition. For Q3, given the subscription mix, we estimate we would have recognized $750 of average license revenue per unit if the perpetual option was chosen instead of subscription. We expect this average to fluctuate as we add more subscribers and deliver new offerings for teams and enterprises. Put another way, when a perpetual commercial customer migrates to subscription, instead of recognizing the approximately $750 of revenue immediately, we are instead recognizing revenue month-to-month with a subscription model.","As I said earlier, in Q3, we added approximately 8,000 Creative Cloud subscriptions per week, exceeding the 5,000 subscriptions per week we assumed in our targets. This overachievement of 39,000 subscriptions multiplied by the ASP of approximately $750 yields $29 million more than expected in Q3 revenue effectively transitioned to Creative Cloud. Using the more than 100,000 subscriptions we added in Q3, we believe we saw a total effective shift in revenue of approximately $75 million from perpetual to Creative Cloud during Q3. In total, the approximately 200,000 subscriptions we achieved to date equates to approximately $150 million in revenue that has effectively transitioned away from perpetual to Creative Cloud.","This leads to one of the most important metrics we will want the financial community to follow going forward. That's the total amount of annualized recurring revenue being driven by Creative Cloud subscriptions. ARR is calculated by multiplying the number of current paid subscriptions by the average monthly revenue per user multiplied by 12. We exited Q2 with Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue of $39 million with an average monthly revenue per user of $36. With the success we had in Q3, that ARR amount increased to $86 million with an average monthly revenue per user of $37. Average monthly revenue per user will fluctuate based on product and geographic mix.","Overall for Adobe, our percent of recurring revenue across all of our businesses exceeded 25% in Q3, driven primarily by growth in Digital Marketing, the initial success of Creative Cloud and the emergence of our document exchange services.","With that context, I'd now like to discuss Q4. We are targeting the addition of 125,000 new paid subscriptions to Creative Cloud in Q4. At the same ASP of $750 we used for Q3 estimates, this would represent approximately $94 million in Q4 perpetual revenue which would effectively move to subscription and ratable monthly recognition. At the Q3 average revenue per user per month of $37, this would add $55 million to our annualized recurring revenue balance as we exit the fiscal year.","We are targeting a Q4 revenue range between $1,075,000,000 and $1,125,000,000. This factors knowledge of our hedges based on the spot currency rates as we ended the quarter. At the midpoint of the Q4 targeted range, as a result of continued momentum with Creative Cloud adoption, we expect our Digital Media segment to be down sequentially. In our Digital Marketing segment, we expect Digital Marketing Suite revenue to grow sequentially in Q4, offset by a slight sequential decline in our legacy enterprise products.","In addition, we're targeting our Q4 share count to be 500 million to 502 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $18 million and $20 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 GAAP tax rate of 23.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5%.","We are targeting a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.34 to $0.39 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.53 to $0.58. These EPS targeted ranges also factor in the continued success of Creative Cloud adoption.","Exiting the year, in just 7 months since the launch of Creative Cloud, we expect to have 325,000 paid subscriptions, bringing the expected total of annualized recurring revenue to more than $140 million. This means we will have effectively transitioned over $240 million of perpetual license revenue to subscription.","Looking beyond 2012, it is clear we are rapidly transforming our business. Our Creative Cloud results to date are exceeding our expectations, and we intend to accelerate the migration to subscription next year. We are also the leader in the fast-growing Digital Marketing category and are quickly building a $1 billion business in the cloud for marketers.","The true health of our growth businesses will be represented by increasing recurring revenue in Digital Media and Digital Marketing, which will be recognized over time. While we aggressively build this recurring revenue stream during fiscal 2013, it will reflect on reported revenue and earnings per share, as is seen in our Q4 targets. The resulting overall financial health of the company will be even stronger, and we will drive higher growth rates for revenue and EPS in 2014 and beyond. We will provide more financial details regarding next year on our Q4 earnings call.","This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mark. Last year, we outlined a strategy to reinvent the company to accelerate growth and capitalize on industry and technology trends. We've reimagined our Creative software franchise as an ever-changing, innovative services offering to drive new customer adoption, increase customer relevance and accelerate growth. We expect to end the year with 325,000 paid subscriptions and over $140 million in annualized recurring revenue. This will be an incredible accomplishment for our Creative Cloud business in just 7 months.","We've created a brand-new Digital Marketing business in the last 3 years and established ourselves as the leader in an explosive market category. By driving 40% year-over-year Digital Marketing Suite revenue growth in Q3, we're on pace to build a high-growth and cloud-based $1 billion business. Through these actions, we've galvanized our employees and made ourselves more mission critical to our customers and eliminated the risk of standing still. Our results demonstrate our strategy has put us on a path to accelerated growth.","Thank you for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, Shantanu. Before we begin Q&A, I have a few logistics items to go over. First, for those investors and financial analysts who want to stay current on the latest Adobe news, we encourage you to follow Adobe on Twitter and Facebook and to frequently check Adobe's corporate blogs on blogs.adobe.com. We are increasingly using social channels as a means to get the word out. In addition, tv.adobe.com is a great resource to learn more about Adobe's products and solutions and check out our new customer case studies. We're in the process of updating Adobe's Investor Relations website to provide easier access to these resources.","In regard to today's earnings report, we have posted several documents on our IR website, including a copy of the script containing our prepared remarks for today's call. Given the new detailed information we provided today, the script should be a useful resource to assist with modeling our business. To access these documents and the other investor-related information, go to www.adobe.com\/adbe.","For those who wish to listen to a playback of today's conference call, a web-based Adobe Connect archive of the call will be available from the IR page on adobe.com later today.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.  Our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Shantanu, on the Digital Marketing Suite, you had another solid quarter. I guess you've also seen new competitors enter the market like salesforce.com. I was just curious if you could give us your thoughts in terms of what you're seeing from that perspective on the competitive side. And I had a quick follow-up for Mark.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Brent. I mean, overall, the -- as you said, the Digital Marketing business is actually doing really well. At the beginning of the year, we had outlined that we would grow both revenue and bookings, and we are seeing solid growth in both of those categories. And I would say our clear differentiation is the fact that we have both the leading data platform right now with the acquisition that we made of Day and the leading analytics product. And so we really don't see a number of competitors right now in that particular space because of our most comprehensive offering and the fact that when you have the data in our platform and the analytics, there really isn't anybody who can close the loop as effectively as we can. So pipeline looks really good. The awareness of our offerings is certainly increasing. I think you'll see us get more awareness as well in the market. But we continue to be really bullish not only about the organic business but also new products like Adobe Social and Adobe AdLens, which was the acquisition of Efficient Frontier.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Quickly for Mark. Just cash is at an all-time high. Would you consider a dividend? Or should we still think of cash use on buybacks and M&A as the primary use?","Mark Garrett","The short answer is you should consider buybacks and M&A as the primary use right now. Keep in mind our cash runs a good 75% offshore. At any point in time, that varies, and it makes it a bit difficult to do a dividend, although we will continue to look at it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer A. Swanson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Jen Swanson Lowe on behalf of Adam. I guess sort of a first question. Looking at -- taking out the impacts of subscriptions and all these other things, can -- how is the CS6 upgrade cycle tracking versus past cycles at this point?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. Why don't I take that? And maybe I'll give you just some overall thoughts as we reflect the performance of both Creative Cloud and CS6 over the last 7 months because, as Mark outlined, we really have to look at it as the sum of what we are seeing in the perpetual business as well as what we are seeing in subscriptions. So let me start off by saying when you look at it combined, we're actually seeing accelerated growth this year with the release of Creative Cloud and CS6, which clearly means that it's not only a healthy business, but we are continuing to innovate against our customers. A couple of other thoughts. When you think about Creative Cloud, it's really important to remember that the initial offering was primarily focused on individuals. We're clearly attracting a new set of customers to Adobe, which was important. And we're really innovating very effectively as we transition our teams to take advantage of cloud delivery. And as we deliver more and more enhancements that are exclusive to Creative Cloud members, as we get the team offering out later this year as well as the enterprise offering, we actually think that, that accelerates adoption and, therefore, as you look at the business in aggregate, accelerates growth for the overall business. In particular, I would say enterprises are also really excited about what they can do with the combination of Creative Cloud on the desktop and our Digital Marketing Solutions and Digital Publishing Suite on the server. So the business, any way you cut it, is very healthy.","Jennifer A. Swanson - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just as a quick follow-up on that, I think when the original positioning around Creative Cloud was with both the opportunity to migrate existing users to the cloud and also an opportunity to attract net new users, and I think you laid out a goal of 800,000 net new users over the next 3 years, putting that against the framework of subscriptions tracking ahead of what you had expected maybe a year ago or when you initially gave that guidance, is the upside coming from more existing customers upgrading or better attraction outside of the core base? And is that still the right trajectory to be thinking about in terms of the user base expansion opportunity?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, again, we continue to think that the unit growth that we expected in 2012, 10% unit growth, we're on track to get that. And frankly, we are seeing adoption in both the categories that you identified, namely new users as well as more and more users as they see the steady pace of innovation clearly understand that the Creative Cloud is the better option moving forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So I guess first question, just, Shantanu, on the introductory pricing on the Creative Cloud, you sound pretty confident that when the price does go up from roughly $30 a month to $50 a month, that you will be able to retain those customers. I'm just wondering what gives you that confidence?  Because in the past, we've seen sometimes a lot of churn when that happens in comparable businesses.","Shantanu Narayen","Two things, Walter, that give us confidence. The first is even when you see the mix of the business today, there are certainly a number of subscribers who have taken the introductory pricing, but we're also attracting a number of customers to the $49.99 offering. In fact, I think Mark mentioned in his prepared comments that when you look at the people who are adopting the list price, it's new customers, and they're adopting at approximately 40%. So that gives us confidence. I mean, certainly, when we see all the innovation that we're putting in there, I think that will also -- the feedback is really quite positive. So there's a lot of research that we've done in data that demonstrates that it is sticky value, that there's additional value that we're demonstrating.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just on the go-to-market on the enterprise side, it sounds like you're going to roll out the Creative Cloud into those customers in 2013. Can you talk about the go-to-market strategy there, just the channels involved? And specifically, do you expect more of those customers to go to Creative Cloud than what you've seen so far among the single users and what you've got coming here with the team users?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Walter. So first, let me specify that the combination of customers that we have in the team offering and in the enterprise offering as a percentage of the total market opportunity, it's huge. So again, as you see the success of Creative Cloud, you have to put in context that, that's happening only for individuals. With respect to the team offering, we certainly expect the channel to be a good partner in helping us get the word out when the offering is released later in November, and everything is under way in terms of the offering there. For the enterprise, the 2 aspects of what we have to do. The first is, like other companies that have done this in the past, we will transition to a term offering, which really reflect that. Again, within the enterprise, it's going to be sticky, and we expect customers to stay current. And Matt has built a really effective sales organization today that's actually selling enterprise license that's recognized perpetual. And what we will be doing is we will be transitioning that sales force to sell this Creative Cloud offering. In fact, the customers are already asking us. Because they hear us talk as much about the Creative Cloud, they want to know how they can do that same content life cycle within the enterprise. And that's, frankly, where the content management of our digital marketing offering as well as Digital Publishing Suite are just a natural complement. So we feel pretty confident about that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Chaitanya Yaramada for Steve Ashley. First, a quick one. Could you comment on how the unit adoption of CS6 and Creative Cloud is tracking versus CS5 at this point in the cycle?","Shantanu Narayen","Again, when we look at it in aggregate, we said that we expect to see the 10% growth in 2012. So it is tracking in line with our expectations.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then should we expect -- how should we think about the impact of the transition to subscription? And next year, you said that you expect to release the team version and enterprise version, and that should accelerate adoption next year. How should we think about that impact next year on revenue? And could that be bigger than the impact on FY '12 revenue?","Mark Garrett","So yes, again, I think as Shantanu said, this is Mark, and as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, you have to view the Creative Cloud health as a combination of what we report in revenue and this annualized recurring revenue metric that we're going to give you every quarter. We really continue to believe, as you see this year, that Creative is a growth business. And as we focus on transitioning the business to subscription, we're clearly going to be focused on building up that annualized recurring revenue balance. So in 2013, as a result of acceleration in this annualized recurring revenue, the combination of the 2 businesses, if you will, the revenue and the annualized recurring revenue, will grow, but the reported revenue in 2013 will decline because we're moving so quickly. And then when you get beyond 2013, so starting in 2014, we believe that you will see growth in reported revenue and accelerated growth in the total business. So we're really pushing this fast, and when we push it really fast, you'll see a dip in 2013 reported revenue. But in 2014 and beyond, you'll see accelerated growth in the total business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies & Company.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Mark, you mentioned that 40% of the full-list-price adopters were new to the franchise. Can you give us a sense for what percentage, let's say, of the total subscribers are in that camp of paying full list price? Or any sort of way we can think about how big that is within the 200,000 base of subscribers you have so far?","Mark Garrett","Yes, Ross, so if you look at the number of people that are buying the full Creative Suite versus, say, the point products, in Q2, 70% of them were buying the promotion price. And in Q3, it's roughly the same, it's 67%. So it's been pretty consistent at about 70% of the people buying the full Creative Suite or buying through the promotion.","Shantanu Narayen","Ross, let me just say one thing -- let me just add one point to, I think, all of those data. It was really important as we had this call that we gave you some insight, as Mark said, in the data that we're seeing in Q2 and Q3. I would also make sure that everybody knows that some of this will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. The underlying trends are really positive, and so as you think about the average revenue per user, as you think about the number of subscribers on the full versus the individual point products, again, we're pleased, and all of these have exceeded our expectations. But I think it's important to set the context that in the -- as team gets introduced, as enterprise gets introduced, we will all see some fluctuation.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. I had a follow-up just on the team offering. It looks like you're planning to bring that to market at a higher price point per user than the current undiscounted Creative Cloud for the individual user. Could you just explain maybe some of the reasons why that will have a higher price point? And also, are you planning to do similar promotions around the team product?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Ross, as it relates to the team offering, there's some functionality that's actually exclusive to a team to enable them to collaborate more effectively on whatever piece of content that they are doing. So as it relates to storage for a team, as it relates to how they can have group folders that they are sharing, as it relates to all of the products that we'll be offering, clearly the digital asset management functionality that we will provide and administration, we clearly believe that there's more value associated with that with teams, and it'll make the entire team more productive. And the same thing is true, frankly, in the enterprise. If you think about every marketing department in an enterprise having a common repository for all of this content, enabling them to put it out on the web, enabling them to create it within app stores, enabling them to monetize it. And so we really believe that the value towards teams and enterprises is larger than individual freelancers. And I think the pricing and go-to-market will reflect that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Perry Huang for Heather. Just one question. Based on the traction with Creative Cloud subscriptions, I guess high level, how should we think about operating margin trends as the user base increases? I realize there are many factors at play like pricing and promotions, the subscriber and offering mix and geo, and that annualized revenue is sort of the benchmark to watch. But just trying to think about how we should try and model that going forward.","Mark Garrett","From a pure product shift going from perpetual to subscription, the margin difference really isn't that great, because this is not yet a hosted offering. It's just an ability to store and sync and share in the cloud, and then you, in essence, download the product to your desktop and you get the power of your desktop by using it on your desktop. So apples to apples, perpetual product to subscription product, the margins are not that terribly different.","Shantanu Narayen","And to give you maybe a little bit more color, certainly the sales and marketing expense as these people are increasing on our platform, the cost associated with the physical goods that get put in the channel are also clearly areas for us to improve the operating expense on. And as Mark said, this will be somewhat offset by people logging in by the storage capabilities. And so as we've modeled it, as Mark said, we continue to think it'll be a very profitable business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions around subscription adoption and pricing. First, with respect to adoption, could you talk about it in terms of geographic adoption, how is it looking in U.S. versus Europe, for example? In addition, with 60% of the business coming from existing customers, that number of around 60,000 or so in Q3 works out to around 1% of the last reported active base number for CS. And I'm wondering if now with the team enterprise versions coming you would expect, in fact, a several-point improvement in what effectively would be the attach rate of Creative Cloud to the existing base. And then a follow-up.","Shantanu Narayen","And so, Jay, if you think about it from an annual perspective, it's clear that based on the math, you have approximately 3 million units that are sort of shipped per year. And what you've seen with the release of the Creative Cloud for just individuals is we've seen fairly good adoption, 325,000 expected by the end of the year. We certainly expect all of this stuff to accelerate when we get the team offerings out as well as when we get the enterprise offerings out. And people will increasingly see that the future of the Creative offering is part of the cloud. In terms of the adoption, which was your first question, by geography, I would say it's pretty similar to perpetual. The large markets that we have, the U.S., in Europe, Germany and the U.K. and Japan, we're seeing adoption in both the perpetual products with CS6 as well as with the cloud. So nothing really stands out in terms of a difference in adoption by geography.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up for Mark on pricing. According to the last 10-Q, the -- there was some discussion about ASPs having come down through the first half of the fiscal year in the Creative side of the business, perhaps due to mix. But could you talk about your experience in the base business pricing for -- particularly on the Creative side and what your assumptions might be going forward on the base business so long as that's still the bulk of the business?","Mark Garrett","Jay, I think what you're referring to is related to the launch. So when we launched the product, CS6, you've got a lot of people that jumped on the point products, you've got a lot of people that upgrade. And as a result of that, you have a slightly lower ASP in that initial launch period. There's nothing material going on in the perpetual product from an ASP perspective that I would identify as a trend.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last clarification, if I may. Earlier in the year, at the Salt Lake conference, there were some mention of adobe.com's revenues at over $0.5 billion a year. Is the bulk of the revenue transition effect therefore affecting the adobe.com revenue so that while the adoption is good in terms of organic or unit terms, the revenue effect is bringing the revenues lower from the previously stated number for adobe.com?","Mark Garrett","Not necessarily. What I said is 97% of the subscriptions right now are being bought on adobe.com, but that doesn't mean that those people would have bought perpetual, necessarily, from adobe.com. They could have bought perpetual anywhere.","Shantanu Narayen","I think you're seeing 2 shifts, honestly, Jay. The first shift is that the business is moving more online and moving directly to Adobe, whether that's by virtue of the fact that they're buying in the store or, frankly, increasingly buying through ESDs so that they get immediate delivery of the software. So that trend continues. In addition to that, as Mark said, when we look at subscriptions, the primary purchase vehicle for individuals for the subscription is directly through us, through Creative Cloud.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of","Of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.  Our next question comes from the line of Richard Fetyko with Janney Capital.","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","As we try to gauge the impact of the transition to subscriptions, you used a $750 ASP for the analysis of migrated perpetual revenues in 2012. What ASP should we assume in 2013, perhaps, or even in the second sort of half of the fourth quarter? Once you launch the Creative Suite -- I'm sorry, the cloud for the team and later for the enterprise, I assume the ASP should be higher and, therefore, the impact to perpetual revenues will be higher as well?","Mark Garrett","No, it's actually the other direction. The impact on perpetual, because these are people that are buying in volume, are going to pay less than the average individual that's buying perpetual today at $750. So the $750 that I used as a surrogate for how much revenue is moving from perpetual would actually come down as you move into team and enterprise, because they're going to pay less, if you will, per seat than an individual will. I can't give you a number for that. Education ultimately is going to impact that as well. I can't give you a number for that today. It's going to be -- it's going to depend on what the mix is that we see in subscriptions, and that mix will get reflected in what we'll use for that corollary to $750.","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And then clarification on your statement that 2013 revenues could dip. Are you specifically talking about the Digital Media segment or Creative Suite revenue?","Mark Garrett","Yes -- I was talking about Creative.","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Creative Suite revenues?","Mark Garrett","Yes.","Richard Fetyko - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then lastly, if I may. A majority of the user growth that you speak about on the Creative side, the 10% increase in 2012 that you're on track to hit, is that coming from -- a majority of that coming from the cloud adoption?","Mark Garrett","Yes. It's, for the most part, coming from the cloud adoption. That was one of the big goals for us with the cloud, was to attract those new users given a lower price point for entry and given the constant innovation that they're going to receive.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Bhavin Shah - Macquarie Research","It's actually Bhavin here for Brad. Can you just give out the linearity in the quarter on subscriptions? Was it fairly similar to that all 3 months [ph]? Or do you see a ramp near the end of August, the initial deadline for promotional pricing?","Shantanu Narayen","I think we continue to see a fairly steady adoption of the cloud. I think you're seeing a lot of people get a free membership. They're converting at a higher rate. You're seeing new subscribers. So I would say as people get more and more familiar with the offering, we're certainly seeing accelerated adoption. And so we continue to be excited about that adoption.","Bhavin Shah - Macquarie Research","And speaking of the free membership, can you just briefly talk about what's exactly included and how you've seen conversions go through the quarter?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, there are 2 parts to what we offer as part of free membership. The first is we recognize that creative professionals work in groups. And so the ability to share their files and their content with other people has always been a really important value proposition to the customers. So one of the things that you can do allows you to have access to all of this content and some minimal storage. For years, Adobe has also been offering trial versions of our software. We certainly, with those old trial versions, didn't necessarily have access to the mail ID of these customers, and we didn't know all of that. We're moving that from a trial subscription to a free membership. So the people who have signed up for free membership also get the same benefits that you would have got in the past with trial downloads, namely access to the software for a month. But now we actually do have access to that subscriber's information.","Bhavin Shah - Macquarie Research","So you -- part of this, how [ph] the increase in conversion from the trial version you had with perpetual to the memberships now with Creative Cloud?","Shantanu Narayen","I'm not sure I follow that question. I mean, we are certainly seeing a higher rate of conversion from the people who are members and who are trial -- using our software to fully paid members.","Operator","Our final question will come from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how you think about cash flow maybe going into next quarter and maybe just some qualitative-type judgments around how we should think about it for fiscal '13 just with the transition going on and how you see that kind of working its way through as we move through this period.","Mark Garrett","I'll spend more time on that when we go through guidance in December when I have a little bit more concrete numbers for you on 2013. But generally, cash flow, it, of course, tracks fairly closely with revenue. We are invoicing customers on a monthly basis with the subscription model, so we get that constant cash flow coming in versus that, say, $750 up front when they buy perpetual. But that gets normalized relatively quickly, especially as we get through 2013, like I said, and you get past this transition period and you start to accelerate growth. So in the longer run, I don't see a change to cash flow from our business.","Shantanu Narayen","So I just wanted to thank everybody again for joining us today. And maybe as a quick summary, we're clearly executing against the 2 growth strategies we outlined in both Digital Media and Marketing. In Digital Media, the Creative Cloud is exceeding our expectations, and, as we thought it would, it's attracting a new set of customers. So clearly, our goal and strategy is to accelerate delivery of the Creative Cloud across all of the different customer segments and accelerate adoption, both in Q4 as well as in fiscal '13. And we think it's really important for you, as you look at the health of that business, to look at the combination of both reported revenue as well as the annualized recurring revenue. And in Digital Marketing, the business is doing really well, both revenue as well as bookings. It's clearly an explosive new category. And we do think that we are uniquely positioned to win, given both our history in the marketing departments within enterprise as well as the comprehensive product strategy that we have with both our data and analytics platform. And I don't think there's any other company that can deliver that last millisecond of content delivery based on information as well as Adobe.","So thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to catching up with you at our next earnings call.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call.

For the full fiscal year we repurchased 8.1 million shares at a total cost of $627 million. We currently have $1.6 billion remaining under our latest repurchase authority granted in January, 2015.","Now I will provide our financial outlook. As a result of the continued momentum in our business, we are reaffirming all of the long-term financial targets that we provided at our Analyst Meeting in October, highlighted by a 20% total Adobe revenue CAGR through fiscal 2018.","For fiscal 2016, our targets include, total Adobe revenue of approximately $5.7 billion, approximately 20% year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth, exiting Digital Media ARR of approximately $3.875 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion during fiscal 2016, approximately 20% year-over-year Marketing Cloud revenue growth, with approximately 30% annual bookings growth, and GAAP EPS of approximately $1.80, with non-GAAP EPS of approximately $2.70.","These fiscal 2016 targets are consistent with the preliminary targets we provided in October at our Analyst Meeting, with the exception of an increase to our Digital Media ARR target.","In October, we provided a FY16 Digital Media ARR growth target of approximately 25%, based on a targeted exit of $2.95 billion in FY15. This implied net new Digital Media ARR growth of $738 million in FY16. We exited FY15 with $2.99 billion of actual Digital Media ARR, above our target of $2.95 billion.","We adjust ARR on an annual basis to reflect any material FX changes. Our fiscal 2015 actual exiting Digital Media ARR of $2.99 billion was based on December 2014 FX rates. We\u2019ve revalued that ARR amount based on December 2015 FX rates and this has led to an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY15 of $2.88 billion.","As a result of the momentum in Q4 that we expect to continue in FY16, we are raising our net new Digital Media ARR growth target to approximately $1 billion from the original implied target of $738 million. This results in a new target of $3.875 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY16.","In addition, we are providing quarterly color on FY16. We expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially during the year. We expect net new Digital Media ARR to ramp sequentially similar to what was achieved in FY15. We expect Marketing Cloud revenue to grow sequentially during the year. However, quarterly year-over-year revenue growth will fluctuate below and above our annual target of 20% based on the amount of perpetual revenue achieved in the prior year ago quarters.","In Q1 fiscal 2016 we are targeting a revenue range of $1,300 billion to $1,350 billion. We expect sequential growth from Q4 to Q1 in Creative and Marketing Cloud. We expect our Q1 share count to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 25% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.","These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.33 to $0.39 per share and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.56 to $0.62. All of our targets are summarized in the Financial Targets document on our Investor Relations website.","In summary, fiscal 2015 was a watershed year for Adobe. Strong growth across key financial metrics reflect our amazing performance. Our long-term financial targets, including a 20% revenue CAGR through fiscal 2018, show that the benefits of our move to the cloud are just beginning.","Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks Mark.

Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open.","Steve Rogers","Good day. It\u2019s Steve Rogers on for Walter. Just wanted to ask you about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the subscribers moving from point to full and just kind of the impact there that, that would have on ARPU? And then I got a quick follow-up if you could allow me second question.","Shantanu Narayen","I think overall in terms of the subscriptions, we saw strength across all of the offerings. Certainly, I think as we innovate, we\u2019re distancing our Creative Cloud offering from the Creative Suite offering. So we\u2019re seeing good migration of existing customers. I would say Q4 was also characterized by international adoption accelerating in countries like Japan and Germany.","Hobbyist and consumer customers are adopting the photography plan and education also continues to grow. And I think all of those contributed to a seasonally strong Q4. I think as you look at the individual versus complete, we've always maintained that individual is a good new way to attract customers to our platform and whether we move them from individual to compete or to we add stock, those are ways in which we are increasing the ARPU. And so across all of them we continue to execute well.","Steve Rogers","Great. And just to follow-up, just on Fotolia, if you just sandbox that business and look at kind of expectations for next year. Can you talk about what you're kind of expecting there and maybe give some color in terms of just standalone Adobe Stock customers versus people attaching on Creative Cloud?","Shantanu Narayen","From how we present that to our customers, the two real opportunities for us is to both take existing Creative Cloud subscribers and offer them an upsell to the Creative Cloud plus the stock subscription and in addition to that for new customers to have opportunity to both get that applications, as well as stock. And we offer both of those today, both of them are doing well.","I think Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks that we accomplish the goals that we set for Adobe Stock for ourselves in fiscal \u201815 and certainly we expect to see it accelerated in \u201816. We\u2019re not breaking it out because it's part of the annualized recurring revenue as well as the revenue that we report in Creative but so far so good.","We've also added on the product side, two things we've added, video files right now which I think is going to be important and with the November release of the Creative Suite products we\u2019ve added integration so that the workflow for the content creative professionals is now improved and enhanced.","Steve Rogers","Good. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes. Thank you. One follow-up on the line of question, the 833,000 subscriber additions, were there anything that you did in terms of incentives in the quarter. You matched with some of the international geographies. Is there anything that you did different to drive conversions in those international markets? How should we think about the sustainability of that impact?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Sterling, as it relates to what we did specifically in Q4, I won\u2019t highlight anything that was unusual or different from what we've been doing since the introduction of the Creative Cloud. We\u2019re constantly finding ways to incent people to move from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud or new customers. And as you know, we look very closely at retention, as well as how they migrate off any promotional pricing that we might do as they finished the first year. So I would say nothing unusual and I think just executing on all cylinders.","Sterling Auty","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan","Hi. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Will you be reporting net new subs going forward and if you have any thoughts on where you're shooting for fiscal \u201818, I know you gave us a framework or ARR revenue EPS but where would you likely be targeting subs as you exit your long-term framework and also on an annual quarterly basis? Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Well, first, thanks Kash for you comments. Clearly, our long-term goal is to attract tens of millions of customers to the vision of Creative Cloud and drive both higher ARR and revenue. It's been important to us through this entire transition to make sure we give you metrics to understand the health of the business. And as we keep stating, we believe that as we are going to introduce new subscriptions whether it's mobile only subscriptions or education subscriptions to attract new customers to the platform, ARR continues to be the most important metric of the health of the business, as well as revenue.","And so certainly, if you look at our goals of tens of millions of subscribers, we continue to expect to see acceleration and subscription growth. But I think the more important metric and maybe to answer Sterling\u2019s question as well in terms of how you think about 2016, I would look at the $1 billion of ARR that we\u2019ve provided and look at the seasonal way in which it was added in FY \u201815. And I think that should be a good proxy for how you model FY \u201816.","Kash Rangan","Got it. Also, secondly, Shantanu, thank you for taking the question. What is your goal for Fotolia attached within the Creative installed base?","Shantanu Narayen","Kash, I'm not sure we have a specific goal that we outline. We certainly think that as we\u2019ve said over 85% of both the buyers and sellers are Creative customers. And so you know, we would like to see all of them when they have inspiration and want to use stock for photography or videos, to use our stock service. And conversely it's a great marketplace for them to monetize their creative assets. So we continue to think there is significant upside there.","Kash Rangan","Happy holidays gentlemen.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks Kash.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Yes. Thanks very much. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the competition in the marketing cloud as you guys get into more multiproduct, multi-year deals. Is the competition so changing, are you seeing or imagine bigger competitors there. Are you still seeing some point products or solutions in the market. And I guess when you talk about lot of these big deals, obviously you guys expand your relationship with Accenture this morning. Could you talk about how many of those big deals have big SI partner or advertising partner going in there with you and the importance of those partnerships? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So multiple questions there Kirk. Let me address the last one first, which is partners are playing increasingly important role in large number of the implementations. I think what we are certainly seeing as it relates to the multi-solutions is digital disruption as this conversation that's happening in every single boardroom and the awareness and the recognition that the customer journey and digital experience is fundamental to making that transformation, we hear that everywhere we go.","And so I think marketing departments, CIOs, Chief Revenue Officers are recognizing that a platform is essential to helping with this particular transformation. So I think what's fueling our business is that the importance of digital transformation is now a Board level discussion rather than just a practitioner. With respect to the systems integrators and the digital agencies, up all of them have been great partners to us.","I think today's announcement with Accenture just highlights how we can even further accelerate in the U.S. what we're doing in healthcare, as well as in financial services with them. To your other question about competitive dynamics that are happening in the marketplace, we clearly have the most comprehensive integrated offering. I don't think that's in question. There are a number of players who are offering point solutions and we recognize much like we did on the creative business that we have to deliver best-of-breed but we have to integrate it better than ever before.","Products like audience manager are starting to really take traction and I think that reflects the growing importance of how customer segmentation is important across our solutions. So we have a number of point product competitors. We have a number of the large enterprise vendors who also look at marketing as an opportunity. I would say for the most part our offering is clearly differentiated and the distinction between us and others as we keep innovating should continue to increase. So it's been a healthy and positive.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much and congrats on the fiscal year.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you and congrats on the quarter. So I want to drill a little bit on deferred revenue which continues to grow much faster than revenue itself and you would expect that to some extent. I just want to confirm that there are no other factors that are affecting or impacting it, there is no change in contract terms or anything else or payment terms et cetera that would be affecting that.","Mark Garrett","Hey, Mark, it\u2019s Mark. No. there is no change there at all. Deferred really is just growing as a result of ETLAs on the creative side and bookings on the digital marketing side, just as you would expect.","Mark Moerdler","And one quick follow-up and deferred is not include the hobbyists, correct? Deferred does not include the hobbyists, correct?","Mark Garrett","Yeah. Because the hobbyists are being billed monthly.","Mark Garrett","Yeah. Anyone that\u2019s billed monthly wouldn't show up in deferred, right. So deferred is just things that have been billed but not yet recognized to revenue. And you also see this effect in the unbilled backlog that I talked about in the script as well.","Mark Moerdler","Perfect. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.","Mark Garrett","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks so much and congratulations for me as well. I just was curious this quarter on the mix of Creative Cloud subscribers between single app and complete, do you have that number, Mark or Shantanu?","Mark Garrett","Yeah. Give me one second Ross. If you have another question, [indiscernible]","Ross MacMillan","Yeah. My second question was on the marketing side, it sounded like you had a very strong booking this quarter. But I think the marketing cloud revenue was a tad lower than the low end of that guidance range you had provided. And I was just curious as to what that puts and takes there were? Was it really just even less perpetual than you thought or any other factors on that line that would be helpful? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yeah. Sure. I'll answer both of those, Ross. So the mix was 52 complete and 48 point on Creative Cloud. And as it relates to digital marketing, what we would say is that as Shantanu mentioned, we're the leader in this category, we've had record revenue and record bookings in that space, AM and Analytics of the largest pieces of the business. And as you know, AM for a little while now has been going through this migration from perpetual to one of the Managed Services offering.","In Q4, to put some numbers around it, in Q4 we had roughly $20 million of perpetual revenue. That was well below what we thought in that $365 million to $400 million range we\u2019ve provided. So even though we were anticipating perpetual being less than it was a year ago, it came in well below the range that we had provided you. In \u201916, the FY16 targets have less than $45 million in perpetual for the entire year.","So we basically taken almost all of the perpetual revenue risk out of the targets for this very reason. So it should not be an issue going into next year. It\u2019s out of the guidance for the most part and it's really the only reason we came in below that range we had provided for Q4.","Shantanu Narayen","And just to clarify, Ross, when Mark says that, perpetual was low, it did change to ratable rather than\u2026","Mark Garrett","Yeah. Yeah.","Shantanu Narayen","\u2026 dropping out and so as it related to bookings\u2026","Mark Garrett","Yeah.","Shantanu Narayen","\u2026 especially when you consider it FX adjusted for constant, we saw both quarterly and annual growth rates greater than 35%, so stronger bookings.","Mark Garrett","And the last thing I'd add to that is, the quarterly growth, when you look at the quarterly growth next year on a quarter year-over-year basis, its going to vary under the 20%, over the 20% slightly each quarter based on how much perpetual was in the FY15 related quarter.","Shantanu Narayen","Yeah.","Mark Garrett","But we still believe we\u2019re going to hit the 20% on a year.","Ross MacMillan","Yeah. That\u2019s very clear. That\u2019s great. And maybe just one very quick last follow-up. Just somewhat like cash\u2019s question, but I know you\u2019re not guiding to subs. But you added $1.1 billion of Creative ARR this year? You're targeting $1 billion next year. That delta if we think about that of $100 million and then we think about your sub adds this past year, is that a good proxy? So call it just under 10% less, is that a good proxy for the way we should think about sub adds give or take or do you think there is an ARPU delta that we should also take into account?","Shantanu Narayen","It\u2019s the later, Ross, and it\u2019s not the former. Again, as we introduced new subscriptions that will target mobile or education as we said and as we are looking to attract tens of millions of subscribers, we don't necessarily foresee decline in year-over-year growth in subscriptions.","Ross MacMillan","Great.","Shantanu Narayen","To put another way there is more growth there.","Mark Garrett","Yeah.","Ross MacMillan","Yeah. Understood.","Mark Garrett","Subscription is to go up.","Ross MacMillan","That\u2019s great. Well, congratulation again. Thanks so much.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Shantanu, the Marketing Cloud, you\u2019ve continued to highlight really strong bookings. I\u2019m curious if you could just walk through what you're seeing in terms of some of the deal sizes, I think in the past you talked about deal sizes are getting bigger, they\u2019re taking more components of the large suite. Anything else stand out to you this quarter or maybe perhaps sort of the last couple of quarters that seems to be a trend that you're seeing now that you haven't seen in the past?","Shantanu Narayen","I think the two things I\u2019d highlight Brent is first, adoption of the entire Marketing Cloud, as well as some of the Core Services. So, I would say, Audience Manager is seeing good strength. Audience Manager, again, just to clarify like a Data Management Platforms, as well as the ability for people to use the same customer segments across each of our products. So we are seeing good growth in Audience Manager.","The two are large components of the Marketing Cloud analytics, as well as Experience Manager continue to power along. Made some good progress with Campaign, Campaign growth has been really good to see. And last but certainly not least, I would say Primetime.","I think with video being explosive category. We haven\u2019t touched on that as much. But TV Everywhere and digital consumptions of videos increasing and so I think we\u2019re continuing to see some good progress in video.","But there is a clear requirement on the part of our customers to say, does all this stuff work together and I think that is only playing to our strength as well our brand. So across the Board we continue to see good strength.","Brent Thill","Okay. And just real quick on the Marketing Cloud, Mark, as a follow-up. The question from investors, obviously, the doubling of the backlog versus the revenue growth for the last two years and at some point that has to converge in your -- your client for that conversions next year? Has there been anything else that\u2019s been surprising on implementation duration or have been some of these transactions has there been any churn on some of the original contracts that have been signed? That is a question that\u2019s come up, but I wanted to, it didn\u2019t sound like it, but I wanted to make sure we ask?","Mark Garrett","Yeah. That\u2019s a fair question, Brent. No, churn has not been a problem, retention remains really high. We've done really well from that perspective. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that as customers do larger deployments. It does take a little bit longer to get them up and running and that delays the revenue clock a little bit. It's not a huge material problem. In fact it\u2019s a good thing, because they are doing larger deals with us. But nothing has changed from that perspective. It\u2019s really\u2026","Brent Thill","Thanks for the color.","Mark Garrett","It\u2019s mainly been this perpetual shift.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Samad Samana","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, I wanted to touch on the geographic side. It looks like there is a nice acceleration in Asia-Pacific? I was curious if there is something specific that drove that. And then conversely with EMEA, it seemed like there is a slowdown, despite you guys calling out fairly healthy booking, especially on the Marketing Cloud side? I was wondering if you guys give us some color on what\u2019s going on in Asia-Pacific and EMEA? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Samad, I mean, when we look at what's happening with the business in Asia-Pacific. Certainly both Japan, we continue to see good adoption of the Creative Cloud and the rest of Asia-Pacific had a very strong Digital Marketing growth as well. I mean, we see more adoption of that. In Financial Services, Australia continues to perform well. And as it relates to Europe as well, I mean we are seeing good growth in Digital Marketing in both regions.","We focused our Digital Marketing on a few geographies, so the U.K., Germany, Australia and Japan, I would highlight as the areas where we are focusing a lot of our Digital Marketing. But nothing stands out in terms of what's happening in those regions. All of them continued to show promise for both Creative Cloud, as well as Digital Marketing.","Samad Samana","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser from Pivotal Research. Your line is open.","Brian Wieser","Thanks for taking the question. Just building more on the Marketing Cloud and Data Management platforms in particular. We\u2019re seeing lot of really interesting suites from some of your competitors out there, integrating more of a focus on attributions from some and then more focus on actual data from others, of course, Google launching theirs. I'm just curious, what sort of vision you have in terms of, how you see Data Management evolving in terms of product offering? Obviously, you're integrated with your overall other product suite. I\u2019m just curious, if you think you need to push further into attribution, for example, push further into display buying that loan, other direction or if the segments that of marketers are focused on are those for whom your currency is most appropriate?","Shantanu Narayen","From our point of view, I think the focus that we have for the digital marketing business in the Marketing Cloud, in particular, is how can we enable people to have a great experience across mobile devices, tablets, and create that compelling web experience that people want. From our point of view, everything starts with the content platform and the data intelligence.","The Data Management platform itself for us, it's a means to both how are you spending your advertising dollars and ensuring that you get the return of investment on that. And the advertising part is just a small portion of our overall marketing cloud revenue as well as our offering.","So it's an important strategic part to enable people to understand who their customers are, the demographics, the profiles, so that they can effectively give them the offering that they need. But it should not be construed as a further increase into the advertising ecosystem even though that's a healthy business for us.","Brian Wieser","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. I would just wonder just watching everything that\u2019s going on with TV dollars shifting and mobile advertising really starting to take up with bigger form factors in the market especially the likes of 6 plus. Just wondering, if you can share with us that kind of how you see this is potentially even accelerating some of the growth that you\u2019ve been seeing. Now that you\u2019ve got kind of what looks like accelerating shift of offline go into online. It seems like you have some attribution technology that really, might out of the competition there.","So, I was just wondering, if you could share that with us. And then the other question was just related to OpEx for Mark. Obviously you guys did a great job in fiscal \u201815 and only grew it by about 2% and your guidance for this year implies a pretty good wrap. I\u2019m just wondering which line items should we see the strongest growth from in fiscal \u201816 from an OpEx perspective? Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Hi, Heather, it\u2018s Mark, I'll start. On the OpEx side, the bulk of the increase will show up in sales and marketing. I mean COGS is going to go up because it's variable with revenue especially in the digital marketing business. But across both businesses, if you want to go after these large new TAMs that we out line at Analyst Day, we\u2019re going to need the sales and marketing dollars to do that. So that that's what's baked into the model for the next three years frankly and that's included in the guidance that we provided.","Shantanu Narayen","And Heather on your first question, first with respect to attribution clearly the versions of the Marketing Cloud have attribution. We\u2019re continuing to enhance the attribution, so that we can not just do attribution at a individual spend level but we can also do it across both the entire Marketing Cloud as well as what's happening between online spend, display spend, service spend, social spend, and off-line spend. So we've been spending more of our research efforts to better enable marketers to understand the efficacy of their dollar spend.","I think with respect to mobile, it\u2019s actually driving everyone of our individual solution components. I think Mark alluded to something like 40 plus percent of the transactions that people now have are on mobile. And so if you think about it from the point of view of the content that\u2019s being delivered to mobile devices, the video that's being consumed on mobile devices, the campaigns that require SMS or messaging, mobile is being just a huge tailwind for us across each of our solutions, in terms of the important for people to have new solutions.","The advertising component again for us is represented in the media optimizer that business is showing growth. But it's not just the advertising part of mobile that's fueling our business. It's the consumption just as much.","Heather Bellini","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Weiss","Thanks. Thank you for taking the question guys and very nice quarter. Two questions, sort of -- one on sort of the [topline segregation] [ph] and the other on expenses. In terms of sort of the -- sort of international adoption of Creative Cloud, you talked about international market is picking up for you guys. How should we think about the lag between sort of where the U.S. is, where that lead us at the spaces versus where international market is and how far back is sort of the rest of world to be beyond -- behind the U.S.?","And then on the OpEx side of the equation, just looking for little bit more color. It looks like you guys said headcount growth around 11% and so that\u2019s picking up a little bit, just wondering where you guys are making those investments and how we should think about that headcount growth into the forward fiscal year?","Shantanu Narayen","I will take the first questions and the first question as it related to sort of the lag between U.S. markets and international markets. The way I would describe it is, Australia was the first place that we introduced it and so we've got tremendous experience through what we did in Australia and certainly, a lot of the focus that we have had has been in the U.S.","The other non-speaking international markets, we consider them a year behind or year and half behind in some cases and catching up, because we put as -- we put a significant amount of our attention in the U.S. So nothing in those markets would lead us to believe that we won't see the same kind of success, but that may give you some sort of measure of where we are in the U.S. versus the rest of the world.","We haven't yet really targeted and we've always talked about this being an opportunity, the emerging markets and having completely different pricing available there, because we continue to believe that there's so much opportunity and what we would say our markets where the propensity to both take subscriptions, as well as the network bandwidth is higher than in some of the other markets. So that continues to be on the roadmap.","Mark Garrett","And if you look at the headcount, it\u2019s pretty consistent with what I told Heather. The headcount adds in Q4 were primarily in sales and marketing. The headcount adds frankly across the entire year were primarily in sales and marketing, and it's really just to drive sales capacity in the sales organization quarter carrying sales capacity and to do marketing activities to address these larger TAMs that we talked about.","Keith Weiss","Thank you.","Mike Saviage","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Hi. Thanks. Good evening. Two things, first, with respect to the ongoing momentum in subscriber apps for Creative Cloud, I understand you are not guiding specifically? But, how are you thinking about the importance or contribution from net new customers, I\u2019ll just say, due to Adobe as you define them as compared to upgrading the base? But first couple of years at least if Creative Cloud looked as new, new customers were something over 20% of the count and that number seem to have move closer to 30% more recently? If you look at over the next couple of years, what sort of contribution of, again, new, new to Adobe kind of Creative Cloud subscribers are thinking of or that you might need to have?","And secondly, for Mark, with respect to the profitability of the digital marketing business, how are you thinking about that in terms of the role of cost of services, which is a large part of that revenue stream, when you look at your cost of revenues sequentially year-over-year, it\u2019s obvious that Digital Marketing is a significant part of the sequential and year-over-year increases in your cost of revenue and that seems to be very heavily driven by services, specifically? So, how are you thinking of the progression overtime of the dependency on services and perhaps, the ability to improve the profitability of the Digital Marketing business?","Shantanu Narayen","Yeah. Sure, Jay. And certainly sub adds we would expect that we will continue to drive net new subscribers to Adobe. You're right it's been more like 30%. We would expect that to continue. That's how we are going to address these large new TAM opportunities that we outlined at Analyst Day.","And in Digital Marketing, the margin on that business continues to improve, from a gross margin perspective. We fully expect that we can do better and better from a hosted gross margin perspective, as well as from a professional services perspective and I would expect that to continue.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","All right. Thanks. And if I could maybe squeeze one more. Are you have such visibility in model but unusually you don\u2019t will be guide to cash flow and I was wondering if you might give a comment on that for \u201916?","Mark Garrett","Well, we did for the first time give a cash flow guide from a CAGR perspective over \u201815 through \u201818 at Analyst Day. So as we get more and more predictable, I\u2019ll look at whether we bring that in a bit tighter, but we did give a 25% cash flow CAGR through \u201918.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Thanks, Mark.","Mark Garrett","Sure. Operator, we\u2019re coming up in the top of the hour, why don\u2019t we take two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Derrick Wood from Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.","Derrick Wood","Thanks. A question on guidance on the Digital Media side, it looks like you\u2019re guiding to 35% growth in ARR and 20% growth in revenue. And I think that these numbers overtime start to converge, but there's obviously still a bit of a delta out there with some slower growth or maybe shrinking perpetual license components. So can you give us some context about what those moving parts are the way on revenue growth as we think about that as in \u201916?","Mark Garrett","Hey, Derrick. It\u2019s Mark. Yeah. You're right. It's a big ARR guide and smaller revenue guide if you will. They do converge overtime and there are pieces in that segment that are perpetual that are telling off that we\u2019ve talked about things like Lightroom, things like the hobbyist products, things like the interactive development, the monetization of our website.","Those pieces of the business have been perpetually oriented and are definitely tailing off, and that's causing a little bit of a short-term slowdown on the revenue growth. But overtime they definitely converge ARR in revenue.","Derrick Wood","And I could squeeze in other one in on the digital marketing side and it was mentioned earlier that longer time to go live because projects are getting more complex that's weighed on time to revenue recognition. Is there anything you can do with the, I guess, engaging with the SI community to lower those cycles or kind of do we expect that to be constant really at these levels going forward?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, I think another way that you should be thinking about it is the customer in question may have the most immediate need of completely replacing their website. But what they decide to do because of the breadth of our offering, say, not only are we going to take the experience manager and analytics solution which is natural, but because all of the solutions work together, we\u2019re actually going to go ahead and engage Adobe in the entire solution.","But in terms of how they implement them, then they may implement them sequentially in order to make sure that they get the most benefit out of it and that it goes smoothly. So some of these are just their large complete replacements of the web infrastructure and the entire online presence. And from our point of view, they\u2019re making a very strategic decision to go with Adobe for the entire platform and so we think that's good. And as Mark pointed out, the revenue starts to flow starting fiscal \u201816.","Derrick Wood","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Brendan Barnicle","Thanks so much. Shantanu, I just wanted to follow-up on your answer to Ross MacMillan\u2019s question and when you think about the guidance for next year, are you contemplating any ARPU improvement?","Shantanu Narayen","I think as it related to ARPU even this year, we did see in the commercial segment actually an ARPU increase. So certainly, the ARPU as it related to commercial increase, the ARPU as it related to the other services were relatively consistent and then when you look at it from a blended point of view, it was also relatively consistent. We definitely expect to see stock getting uptick in terms of the existing install base. At the same time, there are opportunities for us to attract a completely new set of customers whether they be in education, whether they be mobile only customers.","And we would be crazy not to get them to our platform and drive future ARR and revenues. And so that\u2019s the way we are looking at the business. I realize it\u2019s easier to just do a p-time SKU but the truth is we don\u2019t have just one single offering that allows you to take it. It\u2019s the breadth of our offering that will actually enable us to be a more predictable and honestly drive future growth more than sticking to only the Creative Cloud enter single offering. So we\u2019re pleased with way that\u2019s going but hopefully that gives you some color into where we\u2019re headed.","Well, given that was the last question, I just wanted to say we feel like we had a fantastic finish to a great year. And more importantly, we enter fiscal \u201816 with significant momentum as well as an incredible opportunity for us to continue to innovate on behalf of our customers and grow.","As I think about it for individuals, good design in Creative have never been more important. And I think with Creative Cloud, we\u2019ve delivered a one-stop destination that delivers everything from inspiration all the way up to monetization.","And for businesses, the digital disruption topic is absolutely dominating boardroom conversations. And we realized that a direct compelling digital experience is so critical to enabling this transformation and our lead in digital marketing solutions enables all of these customers to make the transition happen.","And from our point of view when you combine these two opportunities, the power of creative content as well as data intelligence, we feel that\u2019s going to continue to fuel our business and excellent execution by our employees helps us deliver the results that you saw. So thank you for joining us today and we look forward to the next call.","Mike Saviage","This concludes our call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen, as well as Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO. In the call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2014 financial results.

The call audio and the webcast archive may not be rerecorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Adobe\u2019s strong performance continued in Q3. We achieved $1.005 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28. Adoption of Creative Cloud, Adobe Marketing Cloud, and Document Services was robust, demonstrating continued momentum across our businesses.","In Digital Media, we continued to deliver new innovation and enhanced value for our customers spanning our Creative and Document Services businesses. In June we unveiled a major update to Creative Cloud with 14 new versions of our desktop applications and four new mobile apps, and we announced the Creative SDK for mobile devices. We added new offerings for enterprises, educational institutions and photographers.","With the pace of innovation accelerating with Creative Cloud, adoption from existing as well as new customers has been outstanding. We exited Q3 with $1.4 billion of Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, which now includes more than 2.8 million Creative Cloud subscriptions and reflects a record increase of more than 500,000 from the prior quarter.","To capitalize on the large opportunity with Creative Cloud, we remain focused on three growth initiatives. First, we are aggressively converting the large installed base of CS customers to Creative Cloud. This transition is going well as CS customers realize the significant value they obtain when they migrate. We are driving this conversion with individuals through trials and promotional pricing on Adobe.com, and moving enterprises and teams to Creative Cloud through direct sales and the channel.","Second, we are expanding the market opportunity through acquiring new customers with tailored offerings such as Creative Cloud for photographers. The potential market for creative expression has never been greater, with the desire to use creative tools at work, at home and at school. While Adobe remains dedicated to meeting the needs of the creative professional, we see big opportunities ahead with a broader array of workers, students and consumers \u2013 and you will continue to see new targeted offerings for these audiences.","And third, we will significantly expand the definition of Creative Cloud with mission critical and valuable services such as mobile apps built on our SDK, training, a marketplace for content, and talent search and acquisition. This focus will expand the Creative Cloud market opportunity and revenue potential beyond our current subscription offerings.","MAX has become the community\u2019s showcase for creative inspiration and innovation, and we are excited about what we will be able to announce and deliver in October, particularly in the area of mobile, which represents a big opportunity for our customers and for Adobe. In Document Services, we achieved strong revenue of $208 million in Q3. Our Document Services business spans Acrobat ETLAs, cloud-based Acrobat services and Echosign. Document Services ARR grew to $217 million exiting Q3.","PDF and Acrobat are de facto standards for document collaboration and workflows, and mobile represents huge potential to increase usage of our document creation, sharing, and signing services. We have permission to expand our footprint and brand in these areas, and are excited about the product roadmap which will position our document solutions as must haves now and in the future. Across our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $1.62 billion at the end of Q3. ","Digital marketing is an explosive category that is fundamentally transforming every business. In order to enable the personalized experience that every consumer expects, companies need to invest significantly in a modern technology platform. This revolution is beginning in marketing, but is extending to include the entire real-time enterprise.","We are the leader in this category. We achieved strong Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings in Q3, and have a healthy pipeline heading into Q4. The volume and size of engagements with our customers is growing. In Q3, the number of customers with annual contract value of greater than $500,000 grew by more than 40% year-over-year.","Examples of marketing-cloud customers wins in the quarter included Adidas, Biogen, British Sky, Ford Motor, H&M, Lloyds Bank, Nestle, The State of Illinois, The State of Utah, Tiffany, Travelocity, The U.S. Department of Treasury, The U.S. Marine Corp, DSV in Germany and Motorola in the UK.","Our value proposition is clearly resonating with marketers, driven by the market share and thought leadership that we have built in the category. Interest in our solutions is high, as evidenced by sold-out conferences across the globe. In addition, we are earning strong industry analyst recognition for our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. Forrester recognized Adobe as a Strong Performer and best positioned in their Digital Experience Delivery Platforms report. Gartner named Adobe a Leader in their 2014 Magic Quadrant for Mobile App Development Platforms, highlighting the capabilities of Adobe Experience Manager, PhoneGap and Digital Publishing Suite. And Forrester named Adobe Campaign a Leader in their Cross Channel Campaign Management 2014 Wave report.","This recognition and our leadership in the Digital Marketing industry is helping to build an even stronger partner ecosystem with software companies, agencies and systems integrators. Recent partnerships include: A global reseller agreement where SAP will resell Adobe Marketing Cloud with their HANA platform and hybris Commerce Suite. The relationship has progressed well since the announcement in March.","A strategic partnership with The Publicis Groupe to deliver the first end-to-end marketing management platform automating all components of a client\u2019s marketing efforts. All Publicis agencies will standardize on Adobe Marketing Cloud, making this our most comprehensive agency partnership to date and a partnership with Wipro, a leader in global IT, consulting and business process services, which is creating a new business unit to deliver integrated marketing, commerce, analytics and customer experience solutions.","In summary, Adobe demonstrated strong execution across our business in Q3. Our Creative Cloud user base continues to grow as we offer an ever-expanding stream of new Creative solutions and tailored customer offerings. Adobe Marketing Cloud had another strong quarter, and is outpacing the market from a solution, partner and customer perspective.","Content and data have never been more important. And Adobe is the leader in both. We have become the trusted content and data partner for the world\u2019s biggest brands, media companies, governments and educational institutions. We have a strong tailwind moving into Q4 and are excited about the opportunities ahead.","We hope to see many of you at our MAX conference. Mark.","Mark Garrett","In the third quarter of FY2014, Adobe achieved revenue of $1 billion 5 million dollars (1.005 billion), within our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.09 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.28.","Looking at highlights in our third quarter, those that stand out include: Driving strong adoption of Creative Cloud; growing Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings well ahead of our target, managing expenses to deliver up-side on earnings per share, achieving record deferred revenue, and generating a substantial increase in recurring revenue; we exited Q3 with 63% of our revenue as recurring. ","In Digital Media we achieved revenue of $621 million. This segment has two major components of revenue: our Creative family of products and our Document Services products. In our Creative business, adoption of Creative Cloud accelerated quarter-over-quarter while reported revenue declined sequentially as expected due to Q2 being the last quarter of any meaningful perpetual CS6 revenue. We exited Q3 with 2 million 810 thousand Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions.","Retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, including renewals after promotional pricing expiration, continues to track ahead of our initial projections. Across all active subscriptions, average revenue per user, or ARPU, in each Creative Cloud offering was consistent with Q2. Given continued adoption of the Photography offering and seasonal Educational strength which are adding new customers, total Creative Cloud ARPU exiting Q3 decreased slightly.","Our success with subscriptions, Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLAs, and Digital Publishing Suite adoption helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $1.4 billion exiting Q3 at constant currency from December of 2013, an increase of $209 million quarter-over-quarter.","Our strategy with segmented Creative Cloud offerings is to target existing customers across all user categories as well as attract new customers to the platform. Overall, we are seeing strength in migrating the installed base, as well as expanding our market with new user adoption.","Adobe\u2019s direct sales force continues to migrate enterprise customers with new ETLAs, and we have a strong pipeline going into the end of the year. Creative Cloud for Team units grew sequentially on both Adobe.com and through the channel.","Subscriptions through the channel were below our expectations in Q3 as resellers came off a strong final push with CS6 in Q2. We expect subscriptions and the associated ARR will gain momentum as the channel now focuses exclusively on Creative Cloud. Q3 adoption of the full Creative Cloud offering in the Creative Professional segment was consistent with our performance in Q2.","Our Photoshop\/Lightroom offering, which was re-branded as the Creative Cloud Photography Program in June, continues to drive new customer adoption as well as migrate those who historically licensed Photoshop Elements and Photoshop Lightroom.","In Document Services, we achieved revenue of $208 million in Q3. Our momentum in this category is being driven by continued adoption of Acrobat \u2013 including several large contracts which closed during the quarter. Adoption of Acrobat ETLAs, Acrobat cloud services and EchoSign grew Document Services ARR to $217 million exiting Q3.","In our Digital Marketing segment, there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and our momentum as the leader in this market continued. We achieved revenue of $290 million in Q3. More importantly, we continued to drive strong year-over-year bookings growth that puts us ahead of our goal for the year. Our success is being driven by an increase in size of transactions, number of solutions per customer, international expansion and growth in partner-driven business.","The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $47 million in Q3 revenue and was consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $47 million in Q3. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies.","Asia as a percent of total revenue was low given Creative Cloud adoption in Japan has been slower than other geographies. With the removal of perpetual licensing from the channel in Japan, we are confident the transition towards Creative Cloud will begin to accelerate.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX had no meaningful impact on revenue. We had $1.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2014, versus $2.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY2014; thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue was $1.5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $7.1 million. Comparing the $1.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2014 to the $10.5 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY2013, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million.","In Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 29% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher than targeted primarily due to stronger-than-forecasted profits in the U.S. Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 12,368 versus 12,026 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 48 days, which compares to 48 days in the year-ago quarter, and 45 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $269 million in the quarter. And our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.52 billion, compared to $3.33 billion at the end of Q2.","In Q3, 2014, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost of $133 million. Now, I would like to go over our financial outlook. We are targeting a revenue range of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. In Q4 we expect Digital Media segment revenue to grow sequentially \u2013 with Document Services revenue relatively consistent with the strong revenue we achieved in Q3.","We expect Creative ARR and Document Services ARR to grow sequentially. We expect net new Creative Cloud subscriptions to grow on a sequential basis and slightly exceed the approximately 1 million net new subscriptions we targeted in the second half of FY2014. We continue to expect we will achieve total Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.925 billion exiting the year.","We are targeting Q4 Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to grow slightly on a year-over-year basis. As you think about Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue, it is important to understand we are seeing increased customer adoption of our term-based Adobe Experience Manager and Adobe Campaign solutions. This is resulting in larger customer engagements, more predictable revenue as well as higher long-term revenue growth.","In FY2013, approximately 45% of these Marketing Cloud bookings were term-based. Entering FY2014, we anticipated a move towards a mix of approximately 60% term-based bookings in FY2014 for AEM and Campaign. With the acceleration of term-based adoption in FY2014, we anticipate achieving approximately 75% term-based bookings this year.","As a result of the faster transition, we estimate approximately $60 million of revenue that would have been recognized in FY2014 will have shifted from perpetual AEM and Campaign licensing to term-based contracts during the year. Adding the Q3 portion back to our results this quarter would have driven total Adobe revenue to the high-end of our targeted revenue range, and Adobe Marketing Cloud would have achieved greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3.","Adding back the estimated Q4 impact, the high-end of our targeted Q4 revenue range would have been $1.1 billion. And adding back the $60 million full-year impact, Adobe Marketing Cloud FY2014 year-over-year revenue growth would have been greater than our annual target of 20%.","We highlighted at the outset of the year our goal of driving at least 25% revenue CAGR for Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue between FY2014 and FY2016 \u2013 and we\u2019re on pace to achieve this. We expect combined revenue with LiveCycle and Connect to decline sequentially; and we are targeting Print and Publishing segment revenue to be relatively flat.","We are targeting our Q4 share count to be 508 million to 510 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $12 million and $14 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of 28% to 29% on a GAAP and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.05 to $0.11 per share, and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.26 to $0.32.

We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instruction) Your first question comes from the line of Ross Macmillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ross Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. Mark, the question on the mix between the full Creative Cloud and the point products this quarter I think maybe some of us thought we might see that return to a higher mix of full Creative Cloud because of the rundown of inventory of the Creative Suite from the channel. Obviously, there was some mix difference there perhaps it\u2019s explained by education strength and so forth. What is your expectation for that mix going forward and also for the blended ARPU as we think about Q4 and beyond? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yes, Hi Ross, like we said on the prepared remarks we feel really good about the quarter, we drove 500,000 units this a Q3 for us which is a seasonally more difficult quarter and we felt very good about how we did. We do believe there is tremendous upside in the channel. In the second quarter you saw the channel was primarily focused on kind of the last hurrah of perpetual revenue with CS6 if you will, this is the first quarter they had to sell exclusively the subscription product and we think there is a tremendous ramp that we are going to see from them contributing to that mix moving forward. Education as you know is strong in Q3 as well we had a good education quarter. And the bundle continues to attract new customers. So we are really happy with how it\u2019s progressing. We do think that the channel will be able to contribute more moving forward and that\u2019s going to help that mix and it\u2019s also going to add to ARPU over time.","Shantanu Narayen","","And Ross maybe if I were to add two other quick things when we think about excluding the PSLR bundle as well as education units, ARPU across the individual team single application as well as the complete CC in all the markets was relatively consistent in fact it increased slightly again. So we feel good about how that performance is happening. And in general you have to also go back to the Creative Suite mix that we had, single application was even in that particular business about 40%. We realize that\u2019s an on ramp that\u2019s accretive to overall ARR as Mark also mentioned with photography bundle. So pleased with how the quarter performed.","Ross Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","That\u2019s great. Maybe just one quick follow-up I know that you\u2019re seeing better retention rates than your initial 80% assumption. Will we get to a point in the near future where we might actually talk about what sort of percentage retention you\u2019re seeing? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","","Well, Ross, we told you approximately 80% we\u2019re ahead of that as we talk about in our retention rate. So we think that gives you the right color to understand that the business is very healthy. I mean other way we look at it is when you think about the number of units that we\u2019ve transacted with 2.8 million subscriptions as well as what we\u2019re doing with the enterprise ETLA that\u2019s already ahead of what we were doing steady state with Creative Suite. And we continue to think there is headroom both in terms of migrating existing customers as well as attracting new customers. So that should also give you a good sense of how healthy the business is.","Ross Macmillan \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much for taking my question.","Mark Garrett","","Let\u2019s take the next question, and let\u2019s try to limit to one just so we can fit everybody in. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","Thanks, good afternoon. Mark just on the Q4 guidance, you are guiding below the Street, I just want to be clear that\u2019s largely a transition to the term versus perpetual?","","Mark Garrett","Yes, Brent. So as I pointed out upfront. In the Adobe Marketing Cloud we\u2019re seeing a much faster move to term based managed services solutions for AM and Campaign. We went into the year assuming about 60% term based mix. And we\u2019re going to end more around 75% and that delta that $60 million delta for the year is what\u2019s really driving the difference. If you look at the fourth quarter as I said we would have been closer to $1.1 billion at the high-end of our range had we not gone through a faster shift of this AM and Campaign from perpetual to term based.","","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","Okay, just a quick follow-on. And as you mentioned the Marketing Cloud bookings were well ahead of target I know you don\u2019t give out a booking number. But can you perhaps just give us some color as it relates to what you\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters relative to your booking target if you significantly seen or any other color you could help us to frame that that would be helpful. Thanks.","","Shantanu Narayen","","Brent, maybe I can jump in there I mean we had talked about getting 30% bookings which would drive 25% CAGR over three years. And as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks we\u2019re seeing significant strength above that particular target and maybe big picture is better to explain that. It\u2019s really in our best interest to manage and deliver the entire customer marketing platform.","And what that is resulting in is we\u2019re seeing multi-year deployments. It\u2019s increasing the revenue per customer, we gave you some color on what we are seeing of deals greater than 500,000 that grew over 40%. What we\u2019re also seeing is more solutions within existing customers, which is driving stickiness. And so I think this transition to the platform the multi-solution, multi-year sale has really gone faster than expected, which hopefully is good news if you want better and more predictable revenue. And that\u2019s why we also provided you with some way to model it with what happen with AEM and Campaign for 2014.","Mark Garrett","","And then just to add on to that one more time, what that does Brent as you know, is it helps drive deferred revenue, we had a record deferred revenue quarter. It also helps drive the unbilled backlog, which we disclosed at the end of the year. And between the two of them now we\u2019ve got roughly $2 billion of contracted business waiting to be recognized in the form of revenue. So it just makes for a much healthier business over all.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks you so much. Shantanu, I was interested in where you might be seeing some of the cross sell around both the Creative Cloud and the Marketing Cloud. And you\u2019ve highlighted that at some of the conferences. Can you give us any more color on where we are in that migration and maybe a sense of \u2013 maybe what percent of the installed base is even looking at using both of those and leveraging both of each other. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","","Sure. I mean I think when we look at what\u2019s happening with our enterprise sales force and the sales force that is selling both the Creative Cloud as well as the Marketing Cloud into enterprises through either ETLAs, the Document Services ETLAs as well as Marketing Cloud bookings. That\u2019s where Matt and his team are driving multiple billions of dollars in terms of what we have been able to sell.","Some customer examples there include publishing, they want to single asset repository and workflow to create content once and repurpose that across web and mobile applications and video, which is fast becoming one of the key things for every publisher to do online, so publishing is a good industry. In retail, you\u2019re seeing more and more of the innovative customers want to completely accelerate their time to market by having the design for these goods directly delivered through this workflow all the way out to manufacturing as well as for the consumer to have the ability to actually create personalized goods directly on a retail website. And video, I think when you talk about creation, delivery and add insertion. So hopefully that gives you some examples, but it\u2019s driving more strategic relationships with customers across all of these industries.","Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citibank. Your line is open.","Walter H. Pritchard \u2013 Citibank","Just one question Mark around pricing, you\u2019ve been in the market now for quite a while with the individual addition and you haven\u2019t talked about what percentage of your customers have gone past the one year anniversary and have had pricing go up. But can you talk about maybe an ARPU on that segment or something that would give us an idea of how many of those customers or what progress you\u2019re seeing in terms of this exploration of the promo and the uplift in ARPU that that would drive?","Mark Garrett","Well, I mean, generally speaking like Shantanu mentioned and I think I mentioned across each of the offerings, the ARPU has either remain constant or actually increased. And from the retention perspective, we\u2019re seeing very good retention with people renewing even after the promo expires. So, as that happens of course it does drive ARPU up.","Shantanu Narayen","And Walter if you go to the website and you look at the pricing for the various offerings, I think you would recognize that the individual complete is about 49.99 and you\u2019ve been look at the promotional pricing at about 29 and for team you know the complete pricing is 69.99 and promotional pricing could be 39 or 49. So, I think that gives you some sense of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of as people migrate off the promotional pricing what kind of ARPUs we are getting from those customers.","Walter H. Pritchard \u2013 Citibank","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners","Yes, thanks very much. Mark you mentioned that the channel had a little bit of a slower start to the third quarter given that they shifted away from the license based product. I guess in your guidance for the fourth quarter. I guess how much will you counting on that bounce back to meet your subscription as well as your ARR targets for the quarter? Or do you expect it to sort of maintain itself the way it was in 2Q that\u2019s up side if you get lift on that?","Mark Garrett","We\u2019re expecting it to move up, I mean, we\u2019re not expecting a huge ramp, but we are expecting it to a move up from here given that they are done with the perpetual and frankly there solely focused on selling subscription now.","Shantanu Narayen","The other thing I might add, is if you look at the traditional Q3 to Q4 transition and you go back and look at what happened last year. The two things that drive it, first is seasonal strength, the second is enterprise ETLAs, Q4 tends to be the strong quarter for that. And so you should factor that and also as you think about how we go from Q3 ARR to adding Q4 ARR.","Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thanks. If I can just add really quick follow-up to Mark\u2019s comment on the deferred being just around this quarter. Obviously, I am sure that the transition of term deals and Marketing Cloud played a part in that. Was there anything else in terms of billing, how you are billing some of your customers that quite a part that you expect to continue to go forward? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yes, I mean there is two big pieces really at Digital Marketing Cloud and then it\u2019s the Creative Cloud as well as, it\u2019s the ETLAs around Creative Cloud as well. ETLAs are build and advanced for the first year and that goes into deferred and then years two and three would show up in that unbilled backlog number that are referenced. So it\u2019s really both businesses that are driving the deferred revenue as well as the unbilled backlog.","Kirk Materne \u2013 Evercore Partners","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you for taking my question. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about the percentage of business from term based bookings and Marketing Cloud that has obviously caught you by surprise. Why would you not just take the step of making all the business completely right about and if you were do it I am wondering what might be a rough way to think about impact your revenue maybe if you could talk about a 10 percentage point shift in term based bookings might be X million of dollars from revenue, so we will not be at all and absolutely surprised by any development in the future.","And also curious we can comment on at the time I think Shantanu likes to mention reiterate that the goal of the company is to do out to the entire installed base. At this base that which we add something looks like you could transition entire large installed base about four years to five year or so. Question is we anticipate that adding more capacity so you could even add more units than what you are doing now to enable this transition to happening with book? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","So Kash there were multiple questions in that let me address sort of that question associated with the term based as well as the perpetual from an offering point of view. There is certainly still a number of customer and we think it\u2019s a competitive advantage for us that want to have the AEM solution the experience managers as well as the campaign solution On-Premise. I mean you can think about government agencies and other agencies who want to actually managed themselves, which is why we can\u2019t completely transition from the perpetual offering to the Managed Services, which we definitely think is the right long-term solution. If you look at the trend as Mark pointed out it\u2019s moved from 45% to close to 75%.","So I think it\u2019s now becoming less and less and as Digital Marketing revenue grows the impact of this is certainly going to be muted. So, I think that should give you comfort as it relates to the marketing cloud, bookings and revenue on that transition.","Mark Garrett","Yes, Shantanu said exactly what I was going to say the 75%, this is the reason we wanted to tell you the 75%, because it shows that we are pretty much through this is a very quick transition the good news is it really happened much faster in the back half of the year, then we\u2019ve got with only 25% left to go and the business in total growing, as Shantanu said it\u2019s not going to have a material impact next year.","Shantanu Narayen","","With respect to a second question cash Q3 was first $500,000 subscription quarter for Creative Cloud it was a couple of half million Q3, it was a strong quarter. And so I mean as we look at what\u2019s happening in the business we have both migrating existing customers, but we continue to add a healthy dose of new customers to the platform. So the strategy that we outline namely getting new customers to the platform as well as migrating continues with CS6 perpetual being strong in the last couple of quarters all of them represent available opportunity or headroom for us to move over to the cloud.","As do some of the countries, where we outlined that the adoption has been slightly slower. So, we\u2019re going to be focused on driving that MAX is going to be another catalyst in terms of how far to the Creative Cloud offering distances itself from the Creative Suite offering. So, we have to continue to innovate, we\u2019re focused only on the Creative Cloud as an offering in; there is still significant headroom opportunity.","","Mark Garrett","","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Jennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Shantanu in your remarks, you mentioned that there was thought of having more targeted offerings against the photography SKUs fees especially given success you had this I guess two questions related to that. One as you think about how those targeted SKUs fit into the traditional point versus suite, strategy, what in terms of breakpoints around packaging and pricing to go after specific use cases versus maintaining the premium ASP traditionally associated with suite is it a situation where we can see a whole spectrum of offerings or are you still working along the lines of point versus suite with a relatively big gap in between. And then related to that in terms of the time horizon that we should think about for intakes of targeted offerings is that something that will give more about next month at MAX or is that something that's going to be more of a multiyear strategy for you?","Shantanu Narayen","","Jennifer, when I think that overall the Creative Cloud offerings in the fact that the complete offering as still we think the best solution for a Creative professional, who wants to create content for multiple kinds of media. We still believe that that\u2019s are really the right offering. Photography has always been even with the traditional Creative Suite, such a large opportunity that having the photography bundle was the right way to go target that. Part of what we are alluding to is new ARPU enhancing services that we will start to introduced and that could be to the entire Creative Cloud customer base and you will start to see some of that starting at MAX. And some of them might be even more market expansion opportunities as it relates to what consumers are trying to do and you\u2019ve seen us introduce mobile offering.","So I think for the core Creative professional, I think we have it right and I think we have to continue to innovative and migrating existing customers, but I think you\u2019re going to start to see us implement against the things we\u2019ve talked about the mobile SDK leading to new ARPU enhancing services for the entire base.","Jennifer Lowe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you. I was wondering just if you could walk us through we\u2019ve heard a lot about how agencies are evolving their Digital Marketing strategies and trying to figure out how to build or whether to buy some of the ad tech that they think they need to serve their clients better, I\u2019m just wondering how you see kind of the landscape evolving on that front and how you feel Adobe, how you position Adobe in that context?","Mark Garrett","For Heather, first I think it\u2019s a good opportunity to reiterate that global agreement that we announced with Publicis Groupe. From my point of view Digital Marketing agencies have always been working with their key clients, Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Revenue Officers, Chief Digital Officers to demonstrate a digital strategy for media buying as well as a Creative strategy.","I think the Creative strategy need continuous unawaited and I think all digital agencies have to continue to provide that Creative strategy and now augmented with what they\u2019re doing on the technology side to enable people to truly understand the return of investment. And move the marketing spend from just being analog to more digital. And I think again if you saw the announcement around what Publicis announced today, Digital certainly becomes a more important part of any agency\u2019s strategy.","I think what they are also seeing honestly is that systems integrators are seeing the marketing automation is a huge untapped market and so I think they\u2019re going to see competition as it relates to the traditional systems integrators, companies like Deloitte or PWC also enter that market. And from our point of view is a technology provider none of these relationships are competitive they\u2019re all using our technology to go implement and automate marketing flows within all traditional industries.","To give you some color, relationship with Publicis allows them to use our technology to do automated search spin or social spin or display using our technology it allows the company like Razorfish that\u2019s part of the Publicis Groupe to go ahead and implement re-platforming associated with websites, it also allows them honestly to now with our audience manager solution have a way to segment both the online and offline customers, which is a big part of how they want to target their offering. So, we\u2019re excited about that and where its agencies or SIs expect to see more people want to partner with Adobe.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.","Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Thank you very much. I would like to have Mark fill a little more on the $16 million. Should we be thinking of this move to 75% being term agreements does it simply mean that we get the license revenue is ratably recognized over the contract term where is there a revenue lift during the first contractor. So, obviously that\u2019s a lift after the first contract. And then a quick follow-up on that?","Mark Garrett","Hey, Mark, yes, its $60 million just to make sure everybody heard that right 60, and it\u2019s recognized ratably over the contract term for the most part. So, it is spread out typically their multiyear deals and its spread out over that multiyear period.","Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","But this is not \u2013 it\u2019s not a move in the first contract term it\u2019s not more revenue and just ratably recognized and then potentially is more revenue for second contract?","Mark Garrett","Correct.","Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Okay. And then the quick follow-up to that keep you online. Are you now selling still selling the same mix of term versus perpetual in this space are you now basically the predominantly selling the term and agreements?","Mark Garrett","Yes, by far we\u2019re now predominately selling the term agreement. So the 75% that will end the year at, like I said, only reads 25% of perpetual. So it\u2019s not going to be material shift in any given quarter moving forward now.","Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derric Wood from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","J.Derric Wood, CFA \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP","You guys talked about Japan being a little weaker than expected, I guess how do you weigh the impact potentially coming from the macro versus the impact coming from kind of the shifting channel focus around Creative Cloud. And then how does that kind of baked into your expectations for Japan next quarter and looking your pipeline and sub add contribution?","Shantanu Narayen","For my point of view I think Japan continues to be large untapped opportunity for Creative Cloud. It\u2019s been a traditional strength for us with the Creative products when we had the Creative Suite offering. I think was a little bit about that geography is the large dependency on our retail in that and we had the retail product in Q2, we see early adapters and we think there is untapped opportunity associated with the Japanese market. So nothing changes our long term view and it\u2019s not a demand issue.","Mark Moerdler \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Thank you","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Breza from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Robert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","","Hi and thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to touch back onto the $6 million market, So if you think about the remaining 25% do you think that\u2019s a \u2013 how should we think about that transition, I know you are saying it shouldn\u2019t be a big part, but do you think that moves to 80% by the end of FY2015 or how do you think that this trends longer term?","Mark Garrett","I think that the 75 continue to group up a little bit I think we will get a point where it stops frankly and we are getting close to that. It\u2019s a little hard to say exactly where, but yes I could see it going up to 80, 20 or something like that over the course of next year. it going to depend in any given quarter on how the booking come in and who the customer are, Shantanu said certain customers want the perpetual version, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to get the point where it moves the needle in term of our total company revenue like it has back half of this year.","Robert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","","Okay maybe as a quick follow, given the strong deferred revenue number that you guys did put up. I mean it\u2019s hard to quantify certainly what growth that - part of that being more of this $60 million to a term based fees or overall strength of the demanded, just qualitative commentary would be helpful? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yes, that the $60 million represents multi-year contraction, so a big chunk of the \u2013 well the $60 million is the impact to this year, but the bookings that that drove will get recognized over time under a term based model and that would show up in next year\u2019s revenue on a ratable basis, the first years would be in differed and years two and three of those booking would be in unbilled.","Robert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","","Great thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Shantanu you marked other than highlighting the momentum you are seeing for EM and for campaign, could you talk otherwise in term of what you are seeing for the other components of marketing class specifically to a example maybe optimizer which you have highlighted in the past as particularly strong new product for you and perhaps update us as well on the number of solution that customer are thinking on the average. I believe the last time you updated that was six months ago at Salt Lake where it was 1.4 solutions to the customer, an update in that respect and then I could follow-up?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Sure Jay I mean in term of the solutions what we were trying to do was highlight the key differentiation that we had. And the differentiation is still very much the combination of experience manager plus analytics. Campaign has been doing really well, after the acquisition of Campaign it\u2019s got really good analyst reviews as well as customer adoption. So Campaign is off to a solid start.","Media Optimizer the amount of marketing spend on the management continues to grow, I would say target has been doing really well, we\u2019ve seen significant growth year-over-year as the ability to offer personalized solutions really increases. And so when I look at it \u2013 the way we look at that business as both new sales which are largely multi-solution sales as well as existing installed customer base and how we can continue to sell existing customers on more and more of our solutions. And when you think about the number of large deals again as we said that grew 40% year-over-year. So, overall I think people are standardizing on our platform, the usage starts always pretty much with AEM plus analytics and now Campaign as a third leg of that.","Robert P. Breza \u2013 Sterne, Agee & Leach, Inc.","Okay. And lastly for Mark, just a clarification from the earlier questions on retention or renewal rates, now that we\u2019ve had 10 quarters at Creative Cloud behind those. Could you talk a little bit more about the cohort turn of the original class from 2012, let\u2019s say or early 2013 in terms of their retention rates to go back eight, nine, ten quarters. How does that retention look?","Mark Garrett","","Yes, so Jay, we can\u2019t kind of get into that level of detail here, but the bottom line is like I said from a retention perspective people are renewing after the promotion along the lines of what we would had expected it\u2019s not even better than we had expected. All I\u2019m chatting here, one thing I try to be very clear about the impact of the Digital Marketing shift from perpetual to term. I think we laid it out at the end of my prepared remarks really well. So if you any questions please refer back to that paragraph and then we can do some more follow-up phone calls, because we try to lay it out exactly as we had in the past under the Creative transition.","Shantanu Narayen","","Next question.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Samad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.","Hi thanks for taking my question, I wanted to ask you about ELA that you kind of after a little bit over a year now. What has existed in upselling that in the installed base and how is the integration we put there, rest of the Marketing Cloud going for that, that\u2019s sort of products?","Shantanu Narayen","","Really well. That\u2019s the solution that we now call Adobe Campaign. Adobe Campaign had another strong quarter in Q3 pipeline looks great for Q4. And the ability to orchestrate these multiple Campaigns across the web, e-mail, SMS outside the U.S. which is pretty strong, we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of Campaign so far.","Samad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.","","And have you seen any change in the competitive environment? ExactTarget with Salesforce for a while now and their customers acquire it for renewals. Has there been any change in the competitive environment in the marketing space for you guys?","Mark Garrett","","Well, I think from a competitive point of view as this market continues to explode, you\u2019re seeing everybody participating that we still think we\u2019re the leader in the category and our solutions are most differentiated. And we continue to grow that by both expanding our footprint, so specifically as it relates to ExactTarget versus Campaign. A lot of the Campaign solutions for us right now are Greenfield opportunities as people are continuing to implement and automate their marketing processes. So we\u2019ve been focused a lot of that.","Samad Samana \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Mark Garrett","","Operator we\u2019re coming up on the hour, so maybe we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird.","Hi, thanks very much for speaking again. Hey, I just wanted to swing back to the Digital Marketing business. Again you talked about the nice increase at the number of larger deals that\u2019s happening there since you introduced platform and I was hoping to get more color over how you\u2019re driving that is that coming from you going back to the installed base and cross-selling multiple solutions into existing customers. Or is that also coming from new customers buying more solutions when they initially buy and where you're getting kind of traction of bundles expect?","Shantanu Narayen","","Steve, the short answer is actually its both, its both and its happening both through our direct salesforce and honestly its happening through partners who are increasingly recommending us as the solution of choice as they going to all of these digital transformation products. Again, I would say till two quarters ago it was largely driven by the combination of AEM and analytics. And then the cross-sell was media optimizer and social and target.","Today I would say the initial sale is much more AEM plus analytics plus Campaign because that\u2019s being very well received. And then the upsells continue to be those other solutions. In terms of industries retail continues to be really strong, automotive is strong, financial services is doing well. Government as government does digital government we\u2019ve had a really strong presence with AEM and analytics and government as well as document security there. So, we\u2019re seeing trend good positive trend across every industry. There isn\u2019t a CMO in the world that I go to who is and talking about digital transformation and trying to understand how technology helps them. So I think it\u2019s that tremendous tailwind, Steve.","Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird.","That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you, Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Well, thanks for joining us, I mean, I think as I think about all of the questions I do want to reiterate what\u2019s traditionally being a weak quarter for Adobe Q3, we really have strong performance both with subscriber additions over $0.5 million, Digital Marketing bookings that was strong as well as Document Services revenue in Q3. And as a result we\u2019re on track to deliver the key financial commitments that we outline for the second half of the year. On the Creative Cloud it still is how do we drive customer adoption and migration to Creative Cloud. Adobe.com has been focused on this for a couple of years and now the entire channel ecosystem as well ELTAs through the enterprise we\u2019re focused on this.","In Digital Marketing I would say awareness has being growing, we continue to drive leadership with successful product launches of our marketing products. The fact that we\u2019re seeing this shift from perpetual to term, we view that as a real positive, because people are shining these large multiyear agreements with us.","On the internal side, the innovation engine is humming. We\u2019re delivering new value with Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud as well as Document Services. And I think the earnings upside continues to demonstrate the leverage of our financial model. We are excited about MAX and we look forward to seeing you there. Thank you for joining us.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call.

Our objective in fiscal year 2013 was to establish leadership in the explosive Digital Media and Digital Marketing categories. I am pleased to report we exceeded the key targets we outlined at the beginning of the year. Through the innovation we\u2019ve delivered to our customers, we were able to beat our annualized recurring revenue goal in Digital Media and exceed $1 billion in Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. More importantly, we have set the stage with our market-leading offerings for accelerated growth. In Q4 we delivered revenue of $1.04 billion, contributing to total revenue of more than $4 billion in FY13.","In Digital Media, we continued to make great progress with our Creative Cloud service. As of the end of Q4, Creative Cloud adoption grew to over 1.4 million subscriptions, exceeding our original target of 1.25 million for the year. Creative Cloud members are receiving a constant stream of new features, products and services each month, and customer satisfaction is high based on our surveys. In addition to paid members, we currently have millions of customers in the pipeline who are trying out the service.","In addition to success with Creative Cloud for individuals, Creative Cloud for teams and enterprise term-based licensing, or ETLAs, also had strong results in Q4. Teams of creatives are realizing the benefits of collaboration, and enterprises are increasing their adoption due to simplified licensing models and integration with Adobe Marketing Cloud\u2019s digital asset management capabilities.","As a result of the strong subscription uptake and increased enterprise adoption, total Creative annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew by $219 million in Q4. The Creative Cloud offering continues to evolve to ensure that we are satisfying our existing subscribers and attracting new members. In September, we introduced the Photoshop Photography Program, providing Photoshop and Lightroom via Creative Cloud to professional photographers and hobbyists at an affordable monthly price. Uptake on this offer has been strong, and we believe adding these users is accretive to our long-term goals.","We continue to build momentum with our digital publishing business, with more than 150 million digital editions delivered to consumers through app stores. This week, we announced that we will be publishing the technical specification for our .folio format, which will further accelerate digital publication adoption. Having established leadership with major publishers, we are now focused on enabling corporate brands like AIG, Prudential, REI and Pacific Life to create tablet apps for use cases such as sales enablement, and company magazines and brochures.","In our Document Services business, Acrobat continued to perform well, with our online document services continuing their strong momentum. We have now surpassed 1.6 million Document Services subscriptions. EchoSign adoption continues, with brands including Volvo, Mary Kay Cosmetics and Citi. Combined with Acrobat ETLAs, Document Services ARR grew to $143 million exiting Q4. Total Digital Media ARR grew to $911 million as we exited the year, surpassing our original and most recent targets of $800 million and $875 million, respectively.","In our Digital Marketing business, we achieved 38% year-over-year revenue growth with Adobe Marketing Cloud in Q4, with total annual revenue of more than $1 billion in FY '13. We continue to have the most comprehensive offering in the market for chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers. Our growth is coming from new logos, as well as increased adoption of our 6 solutions, which is increasing our revenue per customer. We continued to deliver significant innovation to Adobe Marketing Cloud customers during Q4, including major updates to Adobe Analytics, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Social and Adobe Target. We made progress in our integration of Adobe Campaign, our cross-channel campaign management solution that came through our acquisition of Neolane. We became the first cross-channel campaign management provider to charge based on customer profiles instead of email CPMs. This will give marketers a more cost-effective and broader campaign management engine. As we meet with senior-level digital marketers around the world, we hear the same themes:","They are challenged by the growth in the amount of digital content that needs to be created, published and personalized; The need to replatform their web infrastructure to support mobile devices and social platforms; and the complexity of managing campaigns effectively across media, channels and devices and the need to quantify marketing ROI with data.","We know that customers don\u2019t want to be burdened with stringing together point solutions. With the most complete, integrated digital marketing offering, and a long history serving marketers, publishers and agencies, we believe Adobe is in the best position in this space.","In summary, 2013 was an outstanding year. Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark.","Mark S. Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2013 results. I\u2019m also going to spend some time discussing targets for next year and beyond.","In FY '13, Adobe achieved revenue of $4,055,000,000. We had an amazing year in transitioning our Creative business to a subscription model, and building a fast-growing, market-leading Marketing Cloud business. Key financial highlights from the year included:","Exiting the year with Digital Media ARR of $911 million; surpassing $1 billion in Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue; growing deferred revenue to a record $829 million; returning $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program; and building a more predictable revenue stream.","In Q4, approximately 44% of our revenue was recurring, up from approximately 27% in Q4 of last year.","In the fourth quarter of FY13, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,042,000,000. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 were $0.13. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.32. Highlights in the quarter included:","Adding more than 400,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions; growing Digital Media ARR by over $250 million; driving 38% Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth; and increasing deferred revenue by $95 million to a record $829 million.","In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $631 million. This segment has 2 major components of revenue: our Creative family of products and our Document Services products. In our Creative business, customer adoption of Creative Cloud accelerated. We exited Q4 with 1,439,000 paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions. This performance was driven by continued strong adoption of Creative Cloud for individuals and from Creative Cloud for team subscriptions, which grew 62% quarter-over-quarter. The special Photography offer launched in September helped drive new customer acquisition.","In addition to the overwhelming majority of individual subscriptions being transacted on our website, we are also seeing a larger percentage of Creative Cloud for team customers choosing to transact on adobe.com.","Creative Cloud ETLA momentum accelerated in Q4. In the year, we closed more than 1,000 Creative ETLA contracts of greater than $100,000, with more than 80 contracts over $1 million. As a reminder, ETLAs are generally 3-year contracts.","Combined, our success with subscription and ETLA adoption helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $768 million exiting Q4, an increase of $219 million quarter-over-quarter. Our strategic goal continues to be to accelerate adoption of Creative Cloud, and we are focusing all of our innovation there. We added over 500 new and enhanced features to Creative Cloud in FY '13, which is driving higher customer satisfaction.","In addition to promoting the value of Creative Cloud, we are using a variety of targeted promotions to drive awareness, consideration and purchase. This strategy is working and helped to drive our strong subscription and ARR results during the year. In Q4, overall monthly Average Revenue Per User, or ARPU, declined slightly from prior quarters, consistent with our desire to drive customer acquisition. As we make further progress of migrating our large base of users to Creative Cloud, we intend to deliver enhanced value and new services, which will help grow ARPU over time. Creative Cloud members continue to renew as their introductory pricing expires, and overall Creative Cloud retention continues to be above the rate we originally modeled.","As of the end of Q4, 96% of Creative Cloud subscriptions are annual plans versus month-to-month. Our successful Photography offer targeting professional and hobbyist photographers drove the percentage of single-app subscriptions to grow slightly.","In Document Services, we achieved revenue of $198 million in Q4. Our success in this category is being driven by continued adoption of Acrobat, Acrobat ETLAs, Acrobat cloud services and our EchoSign e-signing contract solution. Document Services ARR grew from $106 million exiting Q3 to $143 million exiting Q4.","In our Digital Marketing segment, there are 2 components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering; and in Q4, we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $316 million, representing year-over-year growth of 38%. We also drove strong bookings in the quarter.","Total transactions managed by all our Marketing Cloud solutions grew to more than 5 trillion in Q4. Mobile device use continues to be a driver in our Digital Marketing business. Mobile transactions increased to 33% of total Adobe Analytics transactions, up from 28% last quarter. Our focus on solution selling and Digital Marketing has been a big catalyst for the business this year. The size of our engagements with customers has grown substantially, and new customer acquisition has also been a big driver for -- of our Adobe Marketing Cloud growth. In FY '13, we closed more than 70 contracts of greater than $1 million.","The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $48 million in Q4 revenue. We recently introduced a path for LiveCycle customers to migrate to our Adobe Experience Manager offering. We believe this enhances customer satisfaction and provides an Adobe Marketing Cloud upsell opportunity. As a result, we expect LiveCycle revenue will continue to decline, while Connect revenue will remain relatively flat. Print and Publishing segment revenue was flat quarter-over-quarter, consistent with our expectations.","Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a currency perspective, quarter-over-quarter FX rate changes had a $4.6 million positive impact on reported revenue. Hedging gains contributed $3.1 million to revenue in Q4 FY '13 versus $10.5 million in Q3 FY '13, thus the net sequential quarterly currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $2.8 million. Year-over-year, FX rate changes had an $11.8 million negative impact on reported revenue. Comparing the $3.1 million in Q4 FY '13 hedging gains to the $2 million of hedging gains in Q4 FY12, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $10.7 million. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 26% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher primarily due to taxes accrued as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations during the quarter.","Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 11,847 versus 12,035 at the end of last quarter. The decline was primarily due to summer interns returning to school. Our trade DSO was 52 days, which compares to 49 days in the year-ago quarter and 48 days last quarter. Our DSO inched up due to record deferred revenue exiting the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $315 million in the quarter, and our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.17 billion compared to $3.16 billion at the end of Q3. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 7.9 million shares at a total cost of $405 million.","Now I would like to go over our financial outlook. Before discussing our targets in fiscal 2014, we want to provide additional color around our long-term growth rates and earnings potential. We are thrilled with our success to date in transitioning our business to a model that includes more recurring revenue and predictability and, at the same time, is enabling us to target higher top-line growth. This includes moving our Creative business to a growth-oriented subscription model, as well as building and driving a high-growth SaaS business in Digital Marketing. As a result of our momentum in both of these businesses and our belief in our ability to execute on and seize these 2 large opportunities, we are raising our long-term revenue growth targets in both areas. In our Digital Media segment, customer adoption of Creative Cloud is proceeding more quickly than we anticipated. Subscriptions and ARR have grown faster than expected and, as a result, perpetual Creative revenue has fallen off more quickly. As such, we are targeting an annual Digital Media revenue compound annual growth rate of 20% between FY '14 and FY '16, using FY '14 as the base year. This is higher than our most recent target, which was 15%, or greater revenue growth in just the Creative part of the Digital Media segment for the same period of time.","In our Digital Marketing segment, we are increasing our targeted annual revenue and bookings growth rates for Adobe Marketing Cloud. Between FY '14 and FY '16, we now believe we can achieve a 25% revenue CAGR, driven by annual bookings growth of 30%. These targets replace our prior goals of at least 20% growth for revenue and 25% growth for bookings respectively. Our confidence in increasing these targets is based on our strong execution, our increased investments in the business and the large addressable markets we are focused on with our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. These increased growth rates in Digital Media and Digital Marketing are enabling us to target total Adobe revenue growth of 20% on a CAGR basis between FY '14 and FY '16, with FY '14 as the base year. To drive this substantial growth, we will continue to invest in the business. During the transition, while reported revenue has declined, it has been more than offset by growth in ARR. We believe ARR will continue to grow, and reported revenue will increase sequentially beginning in the second half of FY '14. Margin and earnings growth will follow, consistent with the leverage in our operating model. Based on this, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2 in FY '15, and at least $3 in FY '16.","Now I\u2019d like to discuss fiscal year 2014 in more detail. Within our Digital Media segment, our Digital Publishing Suite revenue and bookings grew substantially in FY '13, with exiting ARR of $33 million. We expect ARR in this business to double next year, and we will include DPS ARR as part of our Creative ARR starting in FY14.","Given the transition to subscription with Creative Cloud has gone more quickly than anticipated, we expect more ARR and less perpetual revenue in FY '14 than we last forecast. We now expect FY '14 will be the last year of any meaningful Creative perpetual revenue, and Creative reported revenue will decline year-over-year as we grow Creative ARR to $1.6 billion.","Our Creative ARR target is based on growing Creative Cloud subscriptions to 3 million by year end and includes DPS. We also expect to overachieve the 4 million subscription target we had originally set for the end of FY '15. We expect Document Services ARR to continue to grow in FY '14, driven by Acrobat ETLA adoption and growth in our Cloud-based services, including EchoSign. Factoring the move to a more ratable model, we expect reported Document Services revenue to be relatively flat in FY '14, with Document Services ARR growing to more than $250 million by fiscal year end.","Combining Creative ARR with Document Services ARR, we expect to exit FY '14 with total Digital Media ARR of $1.85 billion. We expect total Digital Media reported revenue of approximately $2.5 billion in FY '14, and believe it will then grow substantially on an annual basis beginning in FY '15. In our Digital Marketing segment, we expect reported Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth of 20% in FY '14, driven by bookings growth of 30% during the year. In FY '14, we will be transitioning more perpetual revenue associated with our Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager solutions to a subscription model, consistent with the rest of our Marketing Cloud offerings. In FY '13, the substantial majority of revenue for these 2 solutions was recognized upfront on a perpetual basis. If we were to maintain the FY '13 mix of perpetual versus subscription revenue for these 2 solutions in FY '14, our Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth target for FY '14 would have been more than 25%. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, we expect total LiveCycle revenue to decline in FY '14. As a result, we expect LiveCycle and Connect revenue to decline by approximately 25% year-over-year. We expect revenue in our Print and Publishing segment to be flat year-over-year. Based on these targets and projections, we expect total Adobe revenue to be relatively flat year-over- year in fiscal 2014. We expect FY '14 GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $0.27, and non- GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $1.10.","Given our top line revenue CAGR of 20% between FY '14 and FY '16, we expect to grow non-GAAP earnings from this FY '14 target to approximately $2 in FY '15 and to at least $3 in FY '16.","In Q1 of FY '14, we are targeting a revenue range of $950 million to $1 billion. During the quarter, we expect to add approximately $200 million of Digital Media ARR. Given normal seasonality, we believe enterprise ETLAs will decline sequentially, and that we will add slightly fewer net new Creative Cloud subscriptions than what was achieved in Q4. Assuming the midpoint of our Q1 revenue range:","We are targeting total Digital Media revenue to decline sequentially in both Creative and Document Services; we also expect LiveCycle and Connect revenue to decline sequentially; we expect Print and Publishing revenue to be relatively flat; and we are targeting Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%.","We are targeting our Q1 share count to be 511 million to 513 million shares. We are targeting net non- operating expense to be between $18 million and $20 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of 26% on a GAAP and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.02 to $0.08 per share and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.22 to $0.28.","We feel great about our progress against the strategy we laid out 2 years ago. Our commitment and investments in that strategy are setting us up to be the clear leader in 2 large opportunities that represent significant growth potential.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mark.","FY '14 is going to be an exciting year. Through continuous innovation, we will build on our market-leading position in the explosive areas of Digital Media and Digital Marketing. Creative Cloud has become the preeminent creative offering, and we expect to exit 2014 with 3 million subscriptions and $1.85 billion in Digital Media ARR. Adobe Marketing Cloud crossed the billion-dollar threshold in 2013. With the most comprehensive offering in the Digital Marketing space and tremendous customer momentum, we expect to grow our Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings 30% in FY '14.","At the heart of this successful reinvention are our employees. Their continued innovation, passion and dedication make all these accomplishments possible.","Thank you for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, Shantanu. We recently sent out an invitation for Adobe Summit, our annual digital marketing conference in Salt Lake City.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","The first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Shantanu, if you could just talk a little bit about the halo impacts you're seeing from the Marketing Cloud on the Creative Cloud and vice versa? And maybe just give us a sense of what you look at in terms of penetration into the Creative Cloud with the work that you're doing there. And then I had a quick follow-up for Mark.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So, Brent, we are definitely seeing that, as people are thinking about all of their creative applications, the content that they want to deliver across all of these devices, we're definitely seeing more penetration, especially, I would say, in the enterprise between the Creative offerings and the marketing offerings. I think the 2 areas where we see the most synergy right now is the first in our Digital Publishing Suite and the Adobe Experience Manager. That's why we've been -- that's why we decided to actually provide the DPS ARR as well. And the second I would say is, in the digital asset management space, where people are using the new version of the Creative Cloud to store assets under digital asset management. And I would say the field has become a lot better, honestly, about presenting the entire Adobe story to all of these customers.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. Mark, your 2016 guidance implies operating margins -- I believe are back into the mid-30s. Can you just talk a little bit about your confidence in giving that number this far out? And also, why choose to let that go as high as that, given the market that we're in still emerging, at least in the Digital Marketing side? Is there potentially a thought of maybe even pushing a little bit harder on the expenses to continue your lead?","Mark S. Garrett","Yes. Thanks, Brent. Actually, we think that $2 a share in '15 and the $3 a share in '16 gives us the opportunity to invest in the business to have this growth that we've laid out be realistic. We think that gives us the room that we need to drive the business in both Digital Media and Digital Marketing. And you're right, the margin would imply in 2016 something in the 30s as you do your modeling. But again, we feel like that gives us enough opportunity to invest and do the land grab that we think is there in front of us.","Operator","The next question comes from Ross Macmillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Mark, I had a question on ARPU. You commented it was down slightly, and I think we understand that it's a mix of more point products, including the Photoshop Photography program, offset by strength in Team and also customers renewing as -- and coming off promotions. I was just curious, how do you expect that ARPU number to trend in fiscal '14? And when do you think it could -- I guess I'm curious of that trend and when it could actually start to increase on an aggregate basis again.","Mark S. Garrett","Yes, Ross. The way we're looking at it right now, we've said this I think several times, that we're trying to drive growth in ARR. And we're thrilled with the $910 million we did against our original target of $800 million. We're driving more growth. Promotions are clearly a part of that and are going to continue to be a part of that, but we're growing the business, if you look at ARR and revenue combined. And we really want to focus on that ARR number right now, not just on ARPU. It is down slightly. You're right. It's going to move around with product mix and with promotions, but it continues to be more than what we got under the old perpetual model. And right now, we're focused on moving the base and driving new users, and we do think there's a significant opportunity to raise ARPU over the longer term.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Ross, maybe just adding a couple things, we're certainly seeing a lot of new customers being attracted to this platform, and the real benefits of the subscription model are the more customers we can get into the Creative Cloud offering. We're pretty confident, as Mark said, with new value and services. We will find new ways to continue to monetize that particular opportunity. The enterprise was off to a really strong start. I think you see that in the numbers with Q4. And so as we continue to drive people accepting Creative Cloud, we're confident that we have a lot of things on the road map that will help us continue to drive further ARPU gains over time.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's great. And maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Shantanu. I'm curious about your profile versus CPM pricing in the Digital Marketing side of the business. Can you just maybe help us understand what sort of economic dynamic that could play for customers versus the status quo?","Shantanu Narayen","That's a good question, Ross. And fundamentally, as we look at the marketing cloud, our strategy has been really to make sure that we're providing to the Chief Marketing Officer in all of these marketing enterprises, the complete dashboard. And as we think about the complete dashboard and the profile of everything that they are doing across multiple channels, the orchestration has less to do with the traffic on one channel and honestly has more to do with across all of these channels, how many users do they have and how are they providing a consistent way to have interactions with all of those customers? So I think it is fairly innovative pricing that we've introduced. I think we have the ability to rethink the right model for marketers. And we continue to believe that as those customers drive more profiles, that we will benefit from it. So it's different from the existing model. I think it comes from our strength in a multichannel offering and our ability to really, with our content play and our analytics play, upend or disrupt the current industry dynamics.","Operator","The next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","For Mark, just 2 questions. I'm pretty numbers-focused here, but just on -- we're trying to get a sense of the 20% CAGR you gave on the Digital Media business. Impressive growth rates. But I guess as we look at fiscal '16, where that would put you for Digital Media revenue, and we go back and look at fiscal '11 before the transition started, if we take the 20%, we're looking at a CAGR of about 4% for that 5 years, which feels a little low to us. It feels like '16 is the year you're through the transition, and '11 was the year before you started the transition, so there should be somewhat apples to apples, and we're at a 4% CAGR for that period. Could you help us understand, is that a fair compare to look at? And why shouldn't that number be higher?","Mark S. Garrett","Yes. I don't think that's a fair compare to look at, and I might have to do this with you offline, Walter. But we do believe that, as you look at the growth in the Creative business, as we get into those out years, it's significantly above the growth that we would have had under the perpetual model back in 2007, certainly, 2007 to 2012 time frame.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And just one follow-up on the fiscal '14. Would you be able to provide for us the -- you said by '15, all of the perpetual revenue should be gone. Can you give us some sense of what kind of perpetual revenue you're still expecting in fiscal '14, to help us sort of calibrate the model there?","Mark S. Garrett","So we haven't broken it out. One way to look at it though, is there's still -- the great majority of revenue in '13 is coming from perpetual, and the great majority of revenue in '14 will be coming from subscription-reported revenue. It's a complete shift from one to the other. The only thing I'd add is the back half of '14 has very little perpetual revenue left in it. And we really are, for the most part, out of the perpetual side of the revenue stream from a Creative perspective after the second quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two parts of the question. One, Mark, when you look at the Creative ARR guidance of $1.6 billion and measure that against the Creative Cloud subscription guidance of $3 million, I'm wondering -- my math would suggest that you should probably do even higher in Creative ARR, using your old ASP assumptions. And I'm wondering if you have any discounting of ARPU that is built into your forecast that explains why the Creative revenue could not be even greater than you're forecasting. And secondly, your TAM continues to expand pretty significantly, even with your perpetual model declining. The cumulative base of folks that have bought the license at this point is probably in the neighborhood of 14 million, 15 million seats. I'm wondering, when we reach the tipping point where these folks realize that, granted that you have advanced your goal to get to 4 million Creative Cloud subscribers, at what point do these folks realize that they're sitting on outdated versions? And when do you get that big flood of subscriptions into your business? That's for me.","Shantanu Narayen","Let me take the second question first, Kash, which is, we certainly are finding that we are differentiating our current Creative Cloud offering from, as you point out, the last version of CS6. And so I think all our conversations with customers, I think they're seeing more and more innovation only on the cloud. And that's why we continue to be confident about our ability to attract new subscribers. Whether that turns into a steady stream of continued subscriptions as we modeled, or we have a further inflection quicker, we'll see. I think we're focused on driving innovation. We're focused on driving why the Creative Cloud is a better offering. And as you know, Kash, having followed us for many years, we are taking these targets very seriously. So is there upside as we continue to provide innovation? You're right. I mean, we want to take the entire install base and have them move over into the Creative Cloud offering. But we'll just have to play it out. I mean, we're pretty early in this transition in the grand scheme of things. I think the good news is it's gone better than we've expected, and I think people are seeing the value. And customer sat is higher.","Mark S. Garrett","And I was going to say something similar, Kash, to the point on ARR. I mean, we're early in this transition. We've done, I think, a phenomenal job over the past 2 years of modeling this out, and we've just given you a lot of data for the next few years. We're trying to be prudent with what that guidance looks like. There's nothing unusual that we see from a discounting perspective that's going to happen in FY '14 that we haven't seen already in FY '13.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It looks like you guys will end up being one of the largest subscription revenue companies in tech.","Mark S. Garrett","Thanks, Kash.","Operator","The next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Maybe sort of asking Kash's question a totally different way, if you think about your existing install base, you've got a little more than 10% now on Creative Cloud. If you think about getting through that remaining 90%, how many of those customers do you think are going to be comfortable at the price points where Team and Enterprise and individual are now? How many do think you're going to need to use more targeted offerings like the photography solutions to get them over? How many will just wait and eventually suck up the higher price? I guess I'm just trying to get a feel for -- we've seen the first 10% migrate. How many more are going to follow at these types of price points versus you having to be a little bit more tactical and targeted with solutions like the photography suite?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, the first thing I would say, Jennifer, is as you look at the install base, I think it's important to remember, in terms of the numbers that we provide, what's reflected that is also included in the ETLA part of the revenue that we provide. And so when we provide the number of people who are on the perpetual version of the product, we do include the numbers that have chosen in the prior version to do licensing business with us, which is now reflected in ETLA portions. So when you think about the 10%, it's actually higher because there's a lot of people who are actually choosing to do ETLA business with us. So I think that's important to remember. It's not in the 3 million number that we gave. In other words, the enterprise number of units is not represented within the 3 million. I wanted to just clarify that. I think people are finding more comfort with this Creative offering. And I think, honestly, our job as a company is to continue to demonstrate why this is the best offering. And that's what we are focused on. We have an attractive road map. I think in the middle of year you'll continue to see new innovations. And it is our job trying to not only move the entire install base but also to really look at the new customer acquisition, which continues to be an attractive opportunity for us.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And just one quick question, the Digital Marketing business. You mentioned the 70 deals over $1 million, which is a pretty phenomenal number, what -- and obviously, that's been a focus, getting higher price points with some of the new suite solutions. How does that compare to maybe a year ago, what you were seeing in terms of wins over $1 million? Is that a pretty -- is it a doubling? How should we sort of think about that number in the context of where you've been historically in Digital Marketing?","Shantanu Narayen","It's a sizable increase, Jennifer. And the way I would describe it is, for each of the different product areas, as you know, we are about 20 product areas which moved to 6 solutions. For those who had originally transacted business with us through either an individual product or through one of the solutions, I think the upsell opportunity is still all headroom. For all of the new deals that we are providing, we're clearly messaging and trying to market the entire Creative Cloud offering, and that's where we're seeing these fairly sizable deals, some deals significantly higher than that. So we continue to think there's big opportunity in the marketing cloud, which is why we've talked about the 30% bookings. And it's a significant increase. I don't have the exact number year-over-year, but both the ETLA adoption by enterprises, as well as the million-dollar-plus deals in Digital Marketing by enterprises are significant uplifts over last year.","Operator","The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a question with -- wanted to focus on the marketing business a little bit. And I was just wondering, it seems like that space has gotten very crowded, and there's a lot of point solutions in the space right now. I'm just wondering how you're selling versus what some might claim are best-of-breed solutions? And what benefit are you seeing in your win rate as a result of having -- being one of the few vendors that actually has an integrated offering?","Shantanu Narayen","Heather, I think when I look at all of the different RFPs that we are participating in, all of the different deals that are in the pipeline, I can say with a lot of conviction that we aren't seeing one particular competitor in a number of the deals. So I think it's very clear that we are very uniquely positioned. And I think our biggest differentiation honestly in that space is both the lead that we have with the Web Experience Management or the Adobe Experience Manager solution, and the fact that we're the clear undisputed leaders with Adobe Analytics. As we've added all of the other solutions, it just I think adds to the lead and differentiation that we have. And we do see some of the point product solutions. But again, we think, like every other aspect of enterprise software, this is going to get consolidated, and we're the clear leaders in that particular space. And marketers are not going to stand for being the people who integrate all of these point product solutions.","Operator","The next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","I'm going to ask a question I think that was already asked, but perhaps a little bit differently. If I think in the context of your strategic goals and now expecting to overachieve the original 4 million sub target set for fiscal '15, can you talk about what needs to happen for that number to be more like 5 million or 6 million? And how do you think about the trade-off of pricing for units? And what are the lower bounds for ARPU in your model?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Brad, I think -- maybe from a few of the questions, the question is are we being a little conservative about the number that we have, I mean -- I think we're being, as Mark said, prudent about the number. I think the real goals on our part are to continue to make sure that across all of the geographies, the experience associated with people migrating from the perpetual or a licensing version of the product to the cloud is as seamless as possible, and people continue to see the benefits. We are systematically dealing with all of the concerns that people had on the cloud. With respect to pricing, we are offering new options for new customers. We're showing the value. And so I just think, again, in the overall context, this is so early in the space. I think we are very pleased with what we have. We have very high ambitions for how we continue to grow this business. But when we give our targets, we give it based on what we are seeing so far.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Appreciate it. Just a follow-up, another variation on the question that Kash and Jennifer had both sort of asked about the market opportunity, such a tremendous opportunity ahead of you. And if you think about that base of perpetual product that's still out there, all of which seem to be candidates to bring over to Creative Cloud, if you segment that by this huge opportunity by product version, geography, demographic, all the different ways in which you look at the market, where are you seeing outside success? And which segments are proving more difficult to penetrate?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, when we look at the various offerings, I think the individual offering was the first one that we introduced. And I think it's fair to say that the most developed Internet-savvy countries are where we are seeing the greatest adoption. So North America is doing really well with it. The other places that you might expect, like the U.K., continue to do well. So on the individual side, I would say it's sort of following the level of Internet sophistication that exists and infrastructure, frankly, in each of these different places. Enterprise is doing very well right now. I think the enterprise customers see the benefits of all being on the same version of the product. And again, I would say while North America leads the pack, we're seeing more success in the enterprise space around the world. Team did really well. I think that was the third offering that we introduced and Team is also continuing to do. So I would say international continues to be an area of opportunity upside for us, and the developed Internet markets are doing quite well.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Chaitanya Yaramada for Steve Ashley. As you mentioned earlier, the enterprise ETLA numbers are not included in the subscription count, so if you can just help us sort of understand what proportion of the total base is being covered by those ETLA numbers? And I know you mentioned that it's been a little more than what you had expected. That'd be helpful.","Mark S. Garrett","It's Mark. Yes, we don't break out the enterprise ETLA portion in terms of customer number. Some of those deals are, frankly, a little complicated in terms of the number of users and how enterprises might count them, so we don't look at it quite that way. I mean, you see the success in enterprise ETLAs through the ARR number, which you can kind of back into. And you also see it, frankly, in the deferred revenue number. I mean, a huge portion of that jump that you'd see in deferred revenue is coming from the enterprise ETLAs.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. I guess I was just looking for a very high-level color on eventually -- or maybe 2, 3 years, what you might expect the proportion to be, if you can help us. Is it 10%? Is it 40%? Or is the ARR representative of where we think it should be?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, we've said in the past that if you look at the licensing component of the perpetual business, 30%, 40% as sort of with different products, that was the nature of the percentage of what was being sold into the enterprise. I think we've also told you that some people who do what may have been considered Team are now doing Enterprise. But that hopefully gives you a ballpark estimate of what the overall opportunity is.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two quick questions on it. Mark, can you give us a sense of the growth in revenue from existing digital marketing clients' year-over-year contract? I think I'm looking at how much more you're able to sell to the existing clients and how that's changed over time? And I'll give you a second question.","Mark S. Garrett","Yes, sure, Mark. I mean, we're clearly selling more into the install base. I mean, we've said that we have the opportunity to drive more products per customer through the adoption of now the 6 solutions that we have, and that's been a big focus of ours. So there's still a very big opportunity to drive more usage of our 6 solutions within the install base and then continue to grow the install base as well. But -- I mean, there's a lot of headroom left to just sell into the existing install base.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But no sense yet of numbers or any data to give us a sense of how that -- how successful it's been so far?","Mark S. Garrett","Not yet, Mark.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then a second question is you mentioned on the Team versions going to ETLAs a bit. Can you give a little more sense of how we should think about that? Is that going faster than you expected? There are a lot of them moving over that were historically Team opportunities going to ETLAs. Do you think that's going to get bigger going forward?","Shantanu Narayen","I would say it's small in the grand scheme of things, Mark. And I think if you look at the targets that Mark provided with respect to the 3 million subscriptions by the end of fiscal '14 and what we have as $1.85 billion in ARR, again, you can back into what we currently have in terms of expectations on those 2 separate customer segments.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Shantanu, Mark, I'd like to ask first about your thoughts on the outlook for Doc Services, ARR and DPS ARR. With respect to the Acrobat part of it, when you look at it historically, the cumulative base for Acrobat was some fairly large multiple of the Creative base, perhaps 5 or 6 times as large. And you even take into account the much lower ASPs for Acrobat historically versus the Creative products. If you had some reasonable attach rate, let's say, of subscription within the Acrobat base, is there a case to be made that the ARR could become nearly equivalent or similar to the Creative ARR? And then similarly, on DPS, which you're now including, over the last year, you saw the download volume go through DPS grow by about 100 million digital editions, or about 2 million a week. How are you thinking about that in volume -- in terms of your forecast for DPS ARR? Then one quick follow-up.","Shantanu Narayen","Let me take those, Jay. I mean, I think with respect to Doc Services, if you look at the install base, you're right, the install base of people who bought Acrobat over the years is clearly very high. I think we've always mentioned that the Document Services customer segment is probably going to have the balance -- I mean, the ratio of perpetual to subscription continue to be lower than it will be for the Creative segment. And so I think that's what we're continuing to model. We're pleased with the new Document Services that we're providing. Services like EchoSign, as well as services like the ability for people to actually do things like create PDF or export PDF online. And so I think we've guided to $250 million in Document Services ARR. I think it's very healthy. We continue to focus on it. But I think it'll be a slower ramp in that particular space relative to Creative. When you look at the DPS side, DPS is doing well, and we saw the initial customer segment via the media and publisher segment. We're really focused a lot more on corporate. That was what we were trying to say in the prepared remarks. And the use cases for the corporate segment are so much more diverse and varied. Again, whether it's corporate magazines, catalogs, brochures, training material, educational material, mobile applications, there, Jay, tends to be a little bit more of, rather than on a per-download basis, it's just the ability for them to have a server-based environment for their entire enterprise. So there, we're not tracking as much of the digital downloads as we would for the traditional media and publishing customers.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My follow-up is with regard to the Digital Marketing bookings expectations of 30% or more. How much of that is -- or if the higher-than-previous forecast is specifically attributable to Neolane and what kind of upside momentum are you seeing in CQ? What was day?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, the Adobe Experienced Manager solution continues to do exceedingly well. I think the re-platforming of the web phenomenon is only accelerating and that everybody realizes they need a mobile-ready, tablet-ready personalized web infrastructure, and we have the best one on the market. So Adobe Experience Manager continues to do really well. With respect to the acceleration that we expect to see, I think a large part of that is driven by having the most comprehensive integrated offering. And I think that's where you're going to see Adobe place most of its emphasis on the marketing side. Certainly, in Neolane, Adobe Campaign now helps fill another void and helps us upsell within the enterprise to the chief marketing officer. But I think our confidence is based on having the most comprehensive integrated offering.","Operator","The next question comes from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just want to focus on some of the last -- previous questions on the marketing side. I guess my question is sort of how far you want to continue to extend the marketing cloud? Just this morning, we saw a marketing competitor buy kind of somewhat into the commerce space, at least on the edges. We've seen SAP do the same with Hybris and Oracle and ATG. How much, I guess towards the back office and the back end, considering that commerce bridges the gap between the back-end and the front-end marketing, do you want to go, considering that some of your competitors are doing the same?","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Phil, first for your comments on the quarter. I think as it relates to the marketing emphasis that we have, you're right. Multiple people are coming at it from the IT point of view, from the advertiser, as well as from the marketer. And we feel actually very good about what we have with respect to our current marketing offering. We will continue to also look at partnerships as a way to extend it. You mentioned SAP with Hybris. We have a great partnership with them. We think HANA is great technology that allows us to also integrate. But at this point, we feel like our offering is really very comprehensive. We have 2 new initiatives that we also have done. We've announced an audience manager, which is people enabling to start to think about what might happen in a cookie-less world; a media mix solution to think about what the optimal marketing spend should be. So I think there are so many areas for us to continue to extend our current offering. Extending into what would be more traditional IT-led areas or -- is not really an area of focus for us, just given how much expansion we have and the ability to partner with companies, like I said.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it, got it. That's good to hear. I keep focusing on the CMO versus the back office.","Operator","The next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up on a prior question about Neolane, and I was curious whether Adobe Campaign manager with the Neolane edition -- Neolane is seeing any change in its competitive success rate now that it's part of the bigger marketing cloud.","Shantanu Narayen","Again, I would say it's early. Yes, certainly, I think there's no question that our brand of Adobe put behind great technology, like what Neolane had, now part of Adobe Campaign, is going to enhance their opportunities. So I think there's no question around that. We are with some disruptive pricing that we've introduced. I think we're going to have a unique opportunity to upend that with the orchestration. So yes, we are in more RFPs than I think Neolane would have ever been. Neolane had a very strong presence in France. They really didn't have a much stronger presence outside there, and that's something that we can certainly bring to bear. If you look at all of our existing customer base, the blue chip list for all of our other solutions now represent a pipeline for us to go in. And so I think there is upside with respect to that opportunity for us.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And, Mark, just one last one for you. Both you and Shantanu made comments about the new user that you're attracting with the move to the cloud. Is there any way to, as we look at the subscriber, the new subscribers you're adding, to get sort of a ballpark of what percent are coming from the installed base versus what percent are new?","Mark S. Garrett","The truth is, it's hard to get that data, specifically because we don't survey people to bog down the sign-up process. We're confident we're attracting new users, but it's very hard to quantify exactly what that is. But we are very confident we're attracting new users.","Shantanu Narayen","Well, thank you all again. Thanks. And thank you all for joining us on the call. I think there's no question that Adobe is in better shape as we enter FY '14 based on the execution that we demonstrated last year. It's nice to see that we're ahead of the metrics we announced, not just the annual numbers we provided last year, but the analyst meeting in November 11 as well, when we started this transition. And we reflect that no company has gone through a transition of this magnitude. And for us to be ahead of our goals, I think demonstrates the value we're providing to our customers. And the confidence in both the strategy and our ability to execute, enables us to be optimistic about our growth prospects for the next 3 years. Thank you again for joining us today.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call.

FY \u201816 was another great year for Adobe. Our record growth and net income were driven by strong performance in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue, continued growth of Adobe Document Cloud subscriptions and strong revenue and bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4, was $0.80 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90. For the year, we grew total revenue to $5.85 billion, which represents 22% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY \u201816, was $2.32 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.01.","In Digital Media, we are advancing the state-of-the-art for content and setting the standard for creativity and digital documents. We exited the year with over $4 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was $316 million and was driven by continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and design. And in FY \u201816, we expanded our customer base while continuing to deliver a rapid stream of product innovations. We achieved record Creative revenue of $886 million in Q4. For the year, we achieved Creative revenue of $3.2 billion, which represents 38% year-over-year growth.","At the heart of the Creative Cloud is the promise of continuous innovation and the pace at which we are delivering new technology is accelerating. Last month at our MAX Creativity Conference, we unveiled next-generation desktop, mobile and cloud services for designers, photographers and filmmakers as well as sneak previews of creative technologies in the areas of virtual reality, image matching and digital painting. Our Creative customers have always counted on us to turn the future into reality. Creative Cloud is the place designers expect to get the best tools and services in emerging categories like Experience Design and 3D.","Earlier this week, we released two public betas, Adobe XD for Windows, the first all-in-one tool for designing, prototyping and sharing user experiences for web and mobile apps; and Project Felix, a new application that enables designers to create photorealistic composites with 2D images and 3D assets. Adobe Stock continues to gain momentum in the multibillion dollar stock image category. In Q4, we launched the Adobe Stock contributor site, a new platform that allows users to upload and sell photos, illustrations, videos and vectors to the world\u2019s largest creative community. We also announced a partnership with Reuters that will bring their expansive video and photography library, across news, sports, business and entertainment to the Adobe Stock service.","With creativity exploding across the globe, geographic expansion represents a significant growth opportunity. In November, we launched Adobe Creative Cloud for teens in China. China is one of the world\u2019s largest digital economies and we can now address its extensive community of designers and creatives. We believe everyone is creative and should have the opportunity to express themselves. Adobe Spark, our consumer-friendly web and mobile solution for creating and sharing professional quality animated videos, web stories and social graphics, is gaining traction with small businesses, social marketers and students. We will continue to invest in Adobe Spark, which we see as a key way to reach broader consumer audience as part of Creative Cloud.","The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, leverages the PDF standard we pioneered and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was $191 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $475 million. Document Cloud represents the modern way for managing digital documents. Core cloud capabilities like mobile and collaboration as well as services like electronic signatures have become a requirement for our customers. As a result, Document Cloud subscriptions now eclipse licensing of perpetual Acrobat software on adobe.com and we expect to see stronger migration among our enterprise customers in the coming year.","As part of the ongoing innovation delivered through Document Cloud, this quarter, we rolled out critical new scan functionality in our Adobe Reader mobile apps. In October, we expanded the global footprint for Adobe Document Cloud with the launch of the Adobe Sign service in Japan. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels, whether its financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment or automotive, entire industries are experiencing digital disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger brand loyalty and growth.","Adobe\u2019s winning formula is built on a unique foundation of content and data, which enables deep customer insights; development and delivery of consistent personalized experiences; and the ability to monitor and optimize business performance in real time. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the most comprehensive offering in the exploding Digital Marketing category with best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaigns and data management as well as media optimization. We are seeing strong demand for the Adobe Marketing Cloud across the globe as evidenced by the sold-out crowds at events this quarter in London, Paris, Munich and Tokyo. Major customer wins this quarter included Lufthansa, Pandora, UnitedHealthcare, UPS, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and Verizon.","In Q4, Adobe managed record 33.5 trillion data transactions, providing us with an unparalleled view into real-time business and cultural trends. Debuting in 2016, the Adobe Digital Price Index has redefined how inflation and consumer goods prices are tracked and measured and has received broad support from the world\u2019s leading economists. Leveraging over 20 billion visits to retail websites, Adobe Digital Insights\u2019 Holiday Shopping Report accurately predicted online sales for this holiday season within a margin of error of less than 0.5%.","Adobe measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers and $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers go through Adobe Marketing Cloud. This tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends each holiday season.","Last month, we announced our intention to acquire TubeMogul, a leading demand side video advertising platform, further strengthening our leadership in digital marketing and ad tech. Adobe is currently a leader in search, display and social advertising, planning and delivery with our Adobe Media Optimizer solution. The addition of TubeMogul to our ad tech capabilities will enable Adobe\u2019s customers to maximize their video advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Together, Adobe and TubeMogul will enable our customers to identify the right audience segments and plan, execute and measure paid media performance across any device. We expect the transaction to close in December.","In September, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to help enterprises embrace digital transformation. Adobe announced it will make Microsoft Azure, the preferred platform for our cloud services, providing customers with a trusted, enterprise grade global platform and that we will integrate our Adobe Marketing Cloud technology with Microsoft\u2019s Dynamics 365 Enterprise and Power BI. Microsoft announced it will make Adobe Marketing Cloud the preferred marketing service for its enterprise customers and its extensive partner and developer ecosystem.","Adobe\u2019s success has been a result of our ability to predict the future. While others are jumping on the machine learning and AI bandwagon, these capabilities have been the foundation of our innovation for decades. Our engineers and scientists are squarely focused on harnessing the massive volume of content and data assets captured in our cloud solutions to tackle today\u2019s complex experience challenges. Last month, we announced Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei\u2019s services address the critical demands of our creative document and marketing customers from image matching across millions of images to understanding the meaning and sentiment of digital documents to finally targeting important audience segments. Dozens of these intelligent services have been deployed in our products to-date and we are increasingly significant our investment. We also intend to make Adobe Sensei available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers.","Adobe\u2019s success over the decades is in no small part due to the unique culture we have created. In October, we were named a Best Multinational Workplace by the Great Places to Work Institute and this month, we were among the top 10 employers on Glassdoor\u2019s 2017 List of 50 Best Places to Work. We know that a strong workforce is a diverse workforce and we are committed to increasing diversity among our employee base. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including youth coding and media making initiatives to inspire future female technologists.","Being a good global citizen is important to our employees, customers and investors. For the first time, Adobe has been selected as a component of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. For the third year in a row, we received a perfect score on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index report from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In light of these accomplishments, Adobe\u2019s brand momentum has never been stronger and we were honored to be one of the five fastest growing brands on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking.","FY \u201816 was a great year for Adobe. We are driving growth in each of the large categories we have created. With a $64 billion total addressable market by 2019, our opportunity has never been greater. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant and our strategy, our technology and our people set us up for continued success. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and innovation over the past year. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2016 results. In FY \u201816, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $5.85 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $2.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.01. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy and noteworthy achievements including growing Digital Media ARR by $1.13 billion during the year to exit fiscal 2016 with $4.01 billion, well ahead of our original target of $3.875 billion. Achieving 38% year-over-year revenue growth in our creative business and exiting the year with $3.54 billion of ARR. Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $765 million and growing ARR to $475 million, both of which reflect progress against our goal of migrating this to a subscription business. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion and 20% annual year-over-year growth. Generating $2.2 billion in operating cash flow during the year, which represents 50% year-over-year growth. Growing deferred revenue to $2 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.4 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $5.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time and returning over $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program.","In the fourth quarter of FY \u201816, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. Highlights in the quarter included achieving $316 million of net new Digital Media ARR, record Creative revenue of $886 million, which represent 33% year-over-year growth, record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth, strong growth in operating and net income, record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue and 82% of Q4 revenue from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of 316 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.01 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $283 million during Q4 and exited the quarter with $3.54 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals and up-sells. Creative Cloud ARPU grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q4.","As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November, our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in three key areas growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market, driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock. Some highlights against these goals during the year include 53% year-over-year subscription growth outside the U.S., broadly expanding our base of users by adding more than 1 million Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscribers during the year and growing Adobe Stock revenue by more than 40% year-over-year. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $191 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $475 million, the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Driving this growth was adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future.","In Digital Marketing, we achieved record quarterly and annual Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. Entering the year, we targeted approximately 20% Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth and approximately 30% annual subscription value, or ASV bookings growth. Included in these targets in FY \u201816 was an expectation of approximately $45 million of perpetual revenue. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, we experienced increased demand for on-premise, perpetual licensed solutions by some customers. When we combine ASV bookings for the year with an overachievement in first year value of perpetual contracts, we achieved 30% bookings growth.","In Q4, we achieved Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth. With this Q4 performance in FY \u201816, we achieved 20% annual revenue growth. Mobile remains a key driver for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 55% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.5 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY \u201816 versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY \u201816. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.1 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY \u201816 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY \u201815. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to tax benefits recognized as the result of the completion of certain income tax audits. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 47 days in the year ago quarter and 45 days last quarter.","Deferred revenue grew to a record $2 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.76 billion compared to $4.45 billion at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations was a record $696 million in the quarter. During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buyback stock and reduce our share count. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $331 million. We currently have $500 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015.","Now, I will provide our financial outlook. Entering FY \u201817, we have great momentum and continue to see strength across our three cloud businesses. We are excited about our large addressable markets and are uniquely positioned to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. At our November 2 Financial Analyst Meeting, we outlined our long-term strategy and provided long-term growth rates and preliminary FY \u201817 financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to operationally execute against those targets and we are reaffirming our long-term FY \u201815 to FY \u201818 financial targets today.","Since the Analyst Meeting, the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably. Were it not for this currency fluctuation, we will be reaffirming all of the preliminary FY \u201817 targets we provided on November 2. Based on today\u2019s FX rates, we believe our hedging programs will effectively mitigate the impact of these rate changes in Q1 and Q2. But if they persist, current FX rates will affect our ability to achieve the preliminary annual targets due to the impact in the second half of FY \u201817.","As a result, we are providing the following FY \u201817 targets. We expect total revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, which factoring in the extra week in FY \u201816, represents approximately 21% year-over-year growth. We continue to target Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year end for the current currency rates. FX rate changes have resulted in a $27 million reduction and an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY \u201816 of $3.99 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor datasheet and we continue to expect approximately 25% Digital Media ARR growth, which equates to approximately $1 billion of net new ARR in the year leading to approximately $5 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY \u201817.","By quarter, we expect to add approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1, followed by sequential growth of net new ARR in Q2. Then in Q3, we anticipate a seasonally driven sequential decline followed by strong seasonal growth in the fourth quarter to achieve the target for the year. In Digital Marketing, we continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 20% and Adobe Marketing Cloud ASV bookings growth of approximately 30%. Despite the currency impact, we expect to achieve the same FY \u201817 EPS targets we provided on November 2, which are a GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.85 and non-GAAP earnings per share targeted at approximately $3.75. During the year, we expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially each quarter with the largest sequential increase in Q4.","Starting with FY \u201817, we are providing quarterly estimates for our most likely results rather than providing targeted ranges due to the increased predictability in our business. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.625 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1. We expect Digital Media Q1 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. When comparing Q1 FY \u201817 targets, it is helpful to remember that Q1 FY \u201816 had an extra week due to our 52\/53-week fiscal year calendar. Factoring the extra week in Q1 FY \u201816, all Q1 FY \u201817 revenue targets represent greater than 20% year-over-year growth.","We are targeting our Q1 share count to be approximately 501 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be approximately $13 million on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 15% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.71 and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.87. Finally, the targets we are providing today do not reflect our planned acquisition of TubeMogul, which we expect to close in December. We plan to issue updated Q1 and annual FY \u201817 financial targets after the acquisition closes. We strongly believe analysts and investors should wait for the close of the acquisition to combine expected results of both companies into an updated model for the coming year. We plan to host a brief call to discuss our strategy and targets that factor in items such as a stub quarter period and accounting implications.","In summary, 2016 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader with all three of our cloud solutions and we are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We are excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks Mark.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steve Ashley","Thanks so much for taking my question. I was going to look at the Creative Media business, you are hitting on all cylinders, I mean the Creative business is strong, you have strengthened education, Document is coming up the curve, I was going to ask about the consumer opportunity there, can you remind us what you have today in consumer and if there is an opportunity to maybe push out and expand how far you are pushing the consumer market in the future? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","I am happy to take that, Steve. You are right and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we are executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we are targeting new customers. I would point out two or three different initiatives in that space. The first one clearly is Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we are increasingly seeing those consumers adopt Creative Cloud Photography Plan. That continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. Second category that I will talk about are products like Adobe Spark, we are seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you will see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I have continued to impress upon education. Education as a segment does really well in Creative Cloud. It\u2019s our next-generation or whether it\u2019s K-12 students or higher ed, as they get exposed to our products, clearly as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future.","Steve Ashley","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much and congrats on a great fiscal year to you all. Shantanu, the last time we met you, it\u2019s right the week before the election and I think there is a lot of folks, wondering what you guys have seen sort of post the results from a macro perspective, I know you guys are sort of operating and serve your own cadence right now through your products and your strategy, but I was just kind of curious, I guess especially in the Digital Marketing world where you guys are obviously talking to a lot of enterprises, is there any change in tone or I guess projected spend or anything like that, I was just curious, if you could give us kind of an update on that? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. Kirk, I have seen a rally in the stock market as well, which I think all of us have certainly experienced. But in addition to that, I would just continue to emphasize this notion of how all enterprises are being transformed by what\u2019s happening in digital and the urgency with which they really need to think about technology that they can leverage to become more of an experienced business. I think that continues to be unabated. As you saw, we had a pretty strong Q4 revenue growth over 30% year-over-year in the Digital Marketing business. And I think the opportunity continues to be one that we are excited about not just in the U.S. but internationally as well, so nothing that we have seen either just before the election or post election changes are belief in the large opportunity and our continued execution in that space, Kirk.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the overage or the higher than expected demand on-premise perpetual in the Digital Marketing side, how much of that happens in the fourth quarter and if you normalize, how would you kind of characterize the bookings and revenue relative to what your expectations were?","Shantanu Narayen","Sterling, when we look at the entire year first, let me reflect that we continue to think that we both have the most comprehensive offering. And we are pleased with both the revenue and the bookings growth for the year. I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a not. The fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it\u2019s a competitive advantage. And globally, it\u2019s hard to predict which option customers might prefer on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it\u2019s all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and then you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY \u201816, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take given perpetual revenues a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it\u2019s really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Shantanu, the Asian business has been very strong in the last couple of quarters and I was curious if you could just talk through the fall through that you are seeing there, I know you have also made a bigger push into China where many software companies have not been successful for a lot of reasons, can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing there so far, as you push more aggressively to China?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. Brent, I think the two things that we factor in, the first is as we have always stated when we first released Creative Cloud, adoption of Creative Cloud in Asia lagged adoption of Creative Cloud in the U.S. and UK for example, as markets. We now are pleased with the adoption that we are seeing. Australia was always a strong market. Australia continues to be a very strong market. So as it relates to Creative Cloud, as we said even having it in China right now, it was long overdue and the fact that we now have Creative Cloud for teams in China, I think shows our commitment to the Chinese digital economy, which we continue to think is one of the largest, so we feel good about it. The other large opportunity as you know, for us is in the Digital Marketing. And that\u2019s driven by two different phenomena. The first phenomenon is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect the climate of our solutions, whether it\u2019s in retail, financial services or other places to also be true in China and in India and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that\u2019s continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there. There is excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it\u2019s all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing. It\u2019s both about global adoption of our Digital Marketing solutions as well as local companies increasingly recognizing that they have to migrate to digital with mobile being the key driver there.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you can talk about the ETLA performance in the fourth quarter and your expectations in terms of ETLA as a part of that $1 billion in incremental ARR next year? And specifically trying to figure out if that \u2013 if the new ETLA business is still growing. I know you are kind of coming up on some renewals and so forth there. I just wanted to get a sense of the trajectory?","Shantanu Narayen","Net summary, Walter, very strong quarter in Q4, I think driven by two different phenomena. The first is 3 years ago when we had first introduced the ETLA program for our customers it was really more a reflection of what they were licensing for Creative Suite. So I would call them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we are using. Starting in fiscal \u201816, we move to a more complete solution which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding that as they are deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete and clearly resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY \u201817.","Walter Pritchard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Shankar Iyer","Hi, this is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on your overall margin profile as you look into the next few years. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about the increased investment that you are going to make in Sensei and Adobe Spark and whole lot of other products. But if you also look at the large down potential and the potential that as your partnership that can drive your Marketing Cloud and also your margins down over time, what\u2019s the leverage in the model and can we expect an operating margin to be in the 40% to 45% range there by the end of the decade?","Mark Garrett","Hey, it\u2019s Mark. Thanks for the question. I am glad I got one. I was getting ready to go home. So first, we are extremely proud of our ability to be one of the only, if not the only cloud companies that can grow significantly on top line and bottom line and the fact that we got to $3.01 this year and being well ahead of our guidance is something that we are very proud of. We do have room in the model to invest in the businesses that we need to invest in. And if you look at next year\u2019s guidance and you do the P&L based on what we just told you, you are going to come up with operating margins that are increasing by around a point from this year, so from 34% to 35%. We gave you guidance for \u201818. You can see that margins continue to improve from there. I am not going to say at this point that we are going to go back to 40%, which is where we were in 2008, but you can see that there is still tremendous leverage in our model and we feel very good about that.","Shankar Iyer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Stan Zlotsky","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith Weiss. So, I actually wanted to ask a question on the Document Services business, the ARR that you added in Q4 was very impressive. You guys had mentioned in your prepared remarks, the fastest and the most that you have added all year, so what was the driver of that outperformance in the quarter? And more broadly, as you moved the Document Services business to subscription, how are you thinking about that versus the kind of strategy that you adopted moving to Creative Cloud business to subscription as well? So, thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, I think two comments come to mind there. First is it was a very strong year. And if you look at just the Document Cloud segment, ARR, it probably under-represents the momentum that we have with the Document Cloud and Acrobat businesses because as you know, significant number of people also use Acrobat DC when they are using the Creative Cloud. So big picture, it was driven by both the adobe.com where we have very dramatically made the switch from people buying the perpetual product to people buying the subscription offering as well as enterprise and the adoption of new services like Adobe Sign. And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year. And when you think about the unit growth that we are seeing in it, it just reflects that PDF as a standard has continued to be the win, which people share it. For those on the call, I would also really recommend, you try out our new mobile apps and the scan functionality where it\u2019s I would say one of the easiest ways for people to create a PDF out of any picture that they might have using the camera. So continued innovation I think in that space just reflects as paper to digital is this macro trend. We are very uniquely positioned to capitalize on that.","Mike Saviage","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Mark, don\u2019t go home yet. I have a question for you. So the question concerns cash flow.","Mike Saviage","Jay, it\u2019s Mike. I am glad you are in our call, not the Oracle call like others. Thanks.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay, you are very welcome. So, you just grew your GAAP operating cash flow by about $800 million in \u201816. And the question is how are you thinking about cash flow in \u201817? Do you think you could achieve a similar increment even considering all the investments of course that you are talking about, particularly in terms of geographic expansion in Asia, and of course, R&D?","Mark Garrett","Yes, Jay. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we had extremely strong cash flow on the year, really good cash flow in Q4. As I look into next year, I expect very strong cash flow again. I will say, I am glad you asked the question, I will say just so everybody understands cash flow from Q4 to Q1 always naturally declines. We have a lot of payments that get made in the first quarter for commissions and bonuses and things like that. So you should expect a pretty substantial decline just sequentially, but I do fully expect another strong cash flow year next year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, could you talk about perhaps the non net income components of that? I mean, how are you thinking in terms, for example, of deferred in particular?","Mark Garrett","Again, I expect deferred to continue to increase as we drive bookings faster than we are driving revenue.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay, good. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks for taking my question. Mark, when we look at ARR, big picture I guess is that we added about $1.1 billion this year, \u201816, about the same level as fiscal \u201815. We are talking about $1 billion in \u201817, so there is really very little decay in the rate of new ARR being added. And I know you are not yet talking about the year even further out. But how should we be thinking about that kind of pace of moderation shall we see in that ARR increment? And the question really goes to this sort of notion of where we are both in terms of new user adds and base transition? I am just curious to just your high level thoughts.","Mark Garrett","I mean, we have \u2013 like you say, we have been consistently adding around $1 billion. And we feel very good about that number. We continue to attract new users. We continue to drive higher ARPU. We are getting people off of promotions on to full price. We are adding value-add services like Stock, all of those things help drive that ARR number. Retention helps drive that ARR number. So, there is lots of different ways that we can do that. And as you know, we are addressing a much bigger TAM than we were addressing a number of years ago. So all of that plays into our ability, we believe to continue to drive that kind of net new ARR.","Ross MacMillan","And then just one other just follow-up quickly, just on the seasonality of ARR this year, I think this will be the first year where we actually see decline in fiscal Q3. Is that just the base effect like the numbers are getting bigger, are there any particular things this year we should think about as we transition Q2 to Q3 that maybe we didn\u2019t see last year or the prior year?","Mark Garrett","Yes, there is nothing new. We are just trying to make sure we incorporate seasonality. I mean Q3 is a slower seasonal quarter for buying for us and we just want to factor that in.","Ross MacMillan","Okay, thanks again. Congratulations.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Thanks Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Brian Wieser","Thanks for taking the question. Following the TubeMogul acquisition, I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about any other aspects of that type you think you maybe emphasizing investment in whether internal or external and may be relatedly, Tube made a pretty strong focus as an independent company on the demand side orientation, given the business you have on Primetime, I am wondering if you expect it will have some supply side orientation as well?","Shantanu Narayen","I think at this point Brian, what I would say is we are excited about the TubeMogul acquisition. And we are excited about the long-term video as well as data opportunity. Just to highlight from our point of view, TubeMogul enables \u2013 it\u2019s more heft in our Ad Tech platform, which is a key part of as we are targeting the CMO or the Chief Revenue Officer or the Chief Digital Officer at an enterprise and adding to what we have in display, search and social, so that\u2019s good. To your point, we do have now more end-to-end capabilities all the way from video delivery to monetization for our publisher as well as our advertiser customers. And I think what\u2019s perhaps more strategic, the integration between their DSV offering and our DMV, we are seeing more and more people wanting to integrate with our industry leading audience manager DMV. That has really become in fiscal \u201816, a driver of the adoption of the platform. And so I think our goal when this closes, will be to share more about what we are planning to do strategically. But big picture, it just enables us to be more of a trusted platform for the Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Revenue Officers. And to enable both personalization in terms of delivery and better segmentation in deriving value from all of the data that they have. So excited about it and we will say more about that after we close.","Brian Wieser","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jack Cogan","Thanks. It\u2019s Jack Cogan filling in for Heather. So you mentioned Creative Cloud ARPU continues to grow sequentially, I just wondered if you could rank order the drivers behind this, I know you mentioned that users on promo pricing, renewing at full price, new offerings like Stock, maybe if you can just put into context what sort of the biggest drivers are and how long we should expect a tailwind like the promo users renewing at full price to exist? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","All of them are clearly driving the transition of the business to ARR. I would say people are migrating off of the promotional pricing. And as long as they continue to retain to full price, that\u2019s certainly one of the large drivers. I think we talked about enterprise as one of the large drivers. The mix as it moves from single app to complete is another driver. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. And that\u2019s why our strategy of getting more and more people on to the platform, we actually did fewer promotions in the quarter, they were more targeted promotions, so they were successful. And that gives you some color, I think. Stock and Sign are starting to become reasonable ARR and we expect continued growth in both those areas as well.","Jack Cogan","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Nemeroff","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just building on the last one, so some recent survey work that we have done suggest that the majority of enterprises have yet to upgrade to Windows 10, but they plan to do so within the next 12 months to 24 months, so I am just curious, how much of the as yet converted suite days is running Windows versus iOS and do you expect because I didn\u2019t hear you mention in the last answer that those Windows 10 upgrades would drive some of the ARR growth in fiscal \u201817?","Shantanu Narayen","I think big picture, what I would say in that particular space is whenever there are hardware transitions or software transitions with significant new functionality, they always represent opportunities for us to accelerate migration. When people look at Windows in particular, I think what\u2019s most exciting to them is in addition to the incredible hardware that Microsoft and other companies are doing, the fact that it\u2019s touch-enabled, has really made a very significant difference. Video capabilities also in that platform are just so powerful that there is clearly migration from the high end proprietary video systems into PCs, so that hopefully gives you some color. I think Apple continues to innovate. But with Windows 10, as people migrate, it always is an opportunity for us to work with that transition team, to make sure that they also migrate to Creative Cloud.","Michael Nemeroff","Thank you very much.","Mike Saviage","Operator, we are coming up on to the top of the hour. Why don\u2019t we take one more question?","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Samad Samana","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. I apologize if my question has already been asked. I jumped on late. But could you give us any idea, you gave that 1 million use of Photoshop subs that you added on your photography package, maybe any color on just what the full year trend looks like for full Creative Cloud adds and if there is any change in either the retention rate that you saw there or the add-on rates for the Adobe Stock package that the Creative Cloud packs that included Stock? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","I think with respect to both the addition of subs as well as the migration of the business, all of them just continue to be really powerful. If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core Creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes \u2013 if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that. And when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it\u2019s also higher than 80%. So as we look at retention, it\u2019s actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business. And we are pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, it just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform.","Shantanu Narayen","And since that was the last question, for me my summary remarks would be while FY \u201816 was clearly a great year, in many ways I am even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we have created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the two big areas of focus for Adobe empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete, it just represent massive opportunities in our content and data platform really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we are innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth.","I would like to thank our customers, partners, employees and investors and wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you for joining us.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call.

We had a strong Q2 with $1,124,000,000 in revenue, representing 10% year-over-year revenue growth. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.60. Both results were towards the upper end of our targeted ranges for the quarter.","In our Digital Media business, our strategy is to help customers create, publish, measure and monetize their content on any device. We launched Creative Cloud in May, a subscription-based offering that is a hub for creating and publishing content and applications. Creative Cloud includes our new Creative Suite 6 desktop software, tablet applications and integrated publishing services. Creative Cloud will enable us to rapidly deliver new technology to our customers, attract new users through its lower cost of entry, help us build more direct relationships with our customers and address piracy.","At the heart of Creative Cloud is Creative Suite 6. CS6 includes major updates to all of the core CS products, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, InDesign, Illustrator and Dreamweaver. It advances our HTML5 and mobile content creation and app development offerings. Response to the product innovations in CS6 has been strong.","Photoshop CS6 won the PC Mag Editors' Choice Award. We also received positive reviews from Macworld, CNET and Gizmodo.","The value of CS6 is enhanced through innovative touch applications on both iOS and Android devices. We've already released apps such as Photoshop Touch, Debut, Ideas, Proto and Kuler. Creative Cloud services include file storage, on services from Typekit, web publishing using Business Catalyst and will be enhanced through cloud-based sync capabilities.","A key part of the Creative Cloud value proposition will be the ongoing rapid delivery of innovative products, new features and services. Creative Cloud members will receive new offerings such as Lightroom 4, PhoneGap Build, Edge, a version of Photoshop that supports the Retina display in Apple's new MacBook Pro, and Digital Publishing Suite Single Edition as soon as they're available. While early, feedback from the creative community has been outstanding, and Creative Cloud subscriptions are ahead of our targets.","In Digital Publishing, our strong momentum continued during Q2. At our recent Digital Publishing Summit in New York, we announced an array of new features that enhance its display and social capabilities. Digital Publishing Suite now has 850 customers worldwide, up from 600 last quarter. These customers have already published more than 1,700 applications, and we're currently distributing 120,000 publications on average every day to tablet readers with our solution. New customers include Meredith Corporation, which has chosen Digital Publishing Suite to produce and distribute its leading magazine titles, and companies such as Benjamin Moore, Sotheby's and Red Bull, which are using it to deliver apps, which increase customer engagement and sales.","In our video business, we announced advancements to Project Primetime, the industry's first fully integrated video technology platform to deliver seamless viewing of ad-supported TV content across TV, PC and iOS and Android devices. Our new Primetime simulcast enables media companies to simultaneously broadcast their channels online and seamlessly replace ads stitched into the broadcast stream with dynamically inserted ads.","We believe the upcoming Olympic Games will be the largest video-streamed event ever. Adobe technologies, including Adobe and Media Server, Pass [ph], Access, Flash, AIR and Auditude, will help power the first truly digital and mobile Olympic Games to a global audience.","Our Document Services business had a record quarter, driven by a strong Acrobat revenue. These were driven by large enterprise adoption, including landing a $10 million contract with the U.S. Air Force. The record quarter also included momentum in our document exchange services, including EchoSign.","In our Digital Marketing business, our strategy is to help marketers measure, manage and optimize their marketing investments. As every business moves online and increases their digital spend, we will deliver an integrated marketing suite that enables our customers to create personalized web experiences, optimize their multichannel campaigns and manage and measure social engagement.","Our Digital Marketing Suite, which is the combination of Omniture, Day, Demdex and Efficient Frontier and our recently introduced Adobe Social, is the most comprehensive solution in the market. Our leadership positions in content creation and web analytics and our long-term relationships and brand presence with marketers gives us a unique advantage. No other company in the industry offers the end-to-end capabilities that Adobe provides today. This market is clearly heating up given the recent acquisitions by many enterprise software companies as well as the rising interest in big data. Our Q2 results in Digital Marketing demonstrate the momentum we have. We achieved 35% year-over-year growth with our Digital Marketing Suite.","During the quarter, we also hosted successful digital marketing summits in the U.S. and Europe. Overall attendance doubled, demonstrating strong customer interest in our solutions. We repeated this success in Japan earlier this month where we held an innovation Summit that was attended by over 700 digital marketing customers.","In key focus areas, such as Web Experience Management, social media management and multichannel campaign management, we announced significant new developments at these summits. We introduced a new cloud-based version of Day content management and extended the current offering with new eCommerce and social capabilities.","We announced Adobe Social to give marketers the ability to attribute social activity to business results. In fact, we now manage hundreds of millions of fan engagements and interactions on Facebook through the acquisition of Context Optional via Efficient Frontier. We established leadership in companies providing technology to manage online spend through the integration of Efficient Frontier and SearchCenter in our Digital Marketing Suite.","There was significant customer interest in our Digital Marketing Suite's predictive marketing capabilities to reduce the complexity of uncovering hidden behavioral patterns in big data. Predictive marketing is the next frontier in this space, and we're collaborating with our customers to push the envelope in this area. In Q2, we continue to build momentum with our Digital Marketing Suite as we closed business with customers such as Barclays, Electronic Arts, Lenovo, MLB.com and Time Warner Cable.","Later, I will have some closing comments. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed discussion on Q2 results. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. In the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,124,000,000. This compares to $1,023,000,000 reported in Q2 fiscal 2011 and $1,045,000,000 reported last quarter. Q2 GAAP operating expenses were $688.4 million compared to $637.3 million reported in Q2 fiscal 2011 and $648 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q2 were $611.7 million compared to $556.7 million reported for Q2 fiscal 2011 and $571.3 million last quarter.","In Q2, Adobe's effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was slightly higher than planned due to lower-than-targeted international profits. GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2012 were $0.45. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.45 reported in Q2 fiscal 2011 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.37 reported last quarter.","Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q2 fiscal 2012 were $0.60. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.55 in Q2 fiscal 2011 and $0.57 reported last quarter.","I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q2 by business segment. Digital Media segment revenue in Q2 was $818.4 million compared to $754.1 million in Q2 fiscal 2011 and $730.3 million last quarter. Year-over-year, this represents 9% Digital Media segment revenue growth.","Before I comment on Q2 Creative results, I'll review our current offerings. Perpetual CS6 products are now available in most geographies to individuals, small and medium-sized businesses and enterprises through our traditional routes to market. Creative Cloud subscriptions targeted initially at individuals include both the entire Creative Cloud membership offering as well as individual point product subscriptions and are primarily available through adobe.com. Subscribers can commit to either offering on a monthly or annual basis.","While it's only been a few weeks since the launch of the CS6 and Creative Cloud, we can make some initial comments regarding adoption during Q2. Overall Creative performance was in line with our expectations despite some softness in Europe. We now define performance as a combination of perpetual revenue recognized upfront and our Creative Cloud subscription revenue recognized ratably. The total Creative units, including perpetual and subscription, were slightly up from the CS5 launch.","We exited Q2 with more than 90,000 paid subscriptions, exceeding our goal. This total includes CS5.5 subscribers who were transitioned to the new subscription offerings. Approximately 75% of all paid subscribers are choosing the annual commitment as opposed to month-to-month.","While early, approximately 65% of total paid subscribers have chosen the entire Creative Cloud membership offering as opposed to point product subscriptions. And of those subscribing to the entire Creative Cloud membership offering, approximately 70% of them are taking advantage of the introductory promotional price of $30 per month for existing customers.","We are building a healthy pipeline for potential Creative Cloud paid subscribers through marketing programs, trial downloads and free memberships. Currently, we are adding more than 5,000 total net paid subscriptions per week.","Within the Digital Media segment, Document Services revenue was $206.7 million compared to $184.3 million in Q2 fiscal 2011 and $183.3 million last quarter. This was a record quarter for our Document Services products, driven by strong volume licensing of Acrobat as well as continued momentum with EchoSign and our other document exchange services.","Digital Marketing segment revenue in Q2 was $250.9 million compared to $215.1 million in Q2 fiscal 2011 and $259.9 million last quarter. Within the Digital Marketing segment, Digital Marketing Suite revenue was $189.9 million compared to $140.7 million in Q2 fiscal 2011 and $174.3 million last quarter. Year-over-year, Digital Marketing Suite revenue grew 35%. Excluding revenue from Efficient Frontier, Digital Marketing Suite revenue grew by more than 20% year-over-year. Mobile transactions increased to 17% of total site catalyst transactions in the quarter, up from 14% last quarter. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $55.1 million compared to $54 million in Q2 fiscal 2011 and $55 million last quarter.","Turning to our geographic segments in Q2. Results per percent of revenue basis were as follows: The Americas, 49%; Europe, 29%; Asia, 22%. We experienced stable demand in the U.S. and Asia, which was partially offset by some softness in Europe during Q2.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.5 million. We had a $10.7 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal 2012 versus $0.2 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal 2011. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4 million.","From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $8.3 million. We had a $10.7 million hedge gain in Q2 fiscal 2012 versus a $10.3 million hedge gain in Q1 fiscal 2012. That's the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $7.9 million.","Employees at the end of Q2 totaled 10,474 versus 9,963 at the end of last quarter. The sequential increase was driven by hiring in our field organization as well as the addition of summer interns.","Our trade DSO was 43 days, which compares to 51 days in the year ago quarter and 45 days last quarter. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $448.2 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3 billion compared to $2.8 billion at the end of Q1. Our ending deferred revenue balance increased by $43.9 million to $592.8 million.","In Q2, we repurchased approximately 5.3 million shares at a total cost of $175.7 million.","This concludes my discussion of our results. I would now like to discuss our financial targets.","In Q3, we are targeting a revenue range between $1,075,000,000 and $1,125,000,000. At the midpoint of the Q3 targeted range, we are factoring continued softness in Europe and expect our Digital Media segment to be down sequentially.","In our Digital Marketing segment, we expect Digital Marketing Suite revenue to grow sequentially in Q3, offset by a slight sequential decline in our legacy Enterprise products. We expect Print and Publishing to be relatively flat.","We are targeting a Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.38 to $0.43 per share and a Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.56 to $0.61. In addition, we are targeting our Q3 share count to be 501 million to 502 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $18 million and $20 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 GAAP tax rate of 23.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5%.","For the full year, we are narrowing our annual revenue growth target to a range of 6% to 7% to reflect the current European economic conditions. Our updated full year GAAP diluted earnings per share targeted range is now $1.69 to $1.76, and non-GAAP EPS diluted earnings per share targeted range is now $2.40 to $2.46.","This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mark. Our vision at Adobe is to change the world through digital experiences. Over the last few years, we've laid the groundwork for the future of the company through product innovation, acquisitions and business model changes.","We talked earlier this year about focusing our efforts on 2 large market opportunities: Digital Media and Digital Marketing. The goal of our Digital Media business is to revolutionize the creative process. In Q2, we delivered CS6 and Creative Cloud, an offering that provides a comprehensive set of creative tools, applications and services that will take content creation to the next level.","Customer and industry response has been outstanding with subscription adoption ahead of our internal projections. We will build on this early success by providing more rapid innovation and believe this will lead to increased loyalty among our existing customers while attracting the next generation of creative users.","In Digital Marketing, our goal is to be mission critical to digital marketers by transforming how they manage, measure and optimize their marketing campaigns. We are uniquely positioned to win in this rapidly growing category given our leadership addition, the breadth of our offering and the strong relationship we have with the creative community. We intend to expand our offerings and integration across our product lines to ensure we stay ahead of the market and our customers' evolving needs.","Thank you for joining us today.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark, I'm wondering if you could just walk us through the math a little bit on the 90,000 subscribers. First of all, I'm not sure if that was in the quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense of -- you talked about a little bit more of an adoption of Creative Cloud than you're expecting. I'm wondering sort of any quantification you can provide and how much revenue that caused? I mean, if I do 90,000 subs x $300 or $400 equivalent product, that's $30 million or so. Just wanted to make sure I understood kind of what was going on there. That 90,000, if that was all new subs in the quarter. It sounds like somewhat converted.","Mark Garrett","Sure, Walter. It's Mark. So you're right. We did have some people that converted over from the 5.5 memberships. As we mentioned on the call, we are now running at about 5,000 net new subscribers per week. And if you look at the quarter, to answer your question on the revenue impact, we overachieved our projection, and that had an approximately $10 million impact to Q2. But again, this is the impact of the overachievement of subscribers relative to our expectations. It's clearly not the impact of all subscribers. So net answer -- the net answer is about $10 million in the quarter can be attributed to our overachievement on subscribers.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then if you say about your guidance, in order to bring it a bit towards the low end, it sounds like Europe is obviously a piece of that. Is a piece of that also you guys are projecting that, that continue going forward and that it's more of a headwind for the year than you might have anticipated back in November when you started talking about that?","Mark Garrett","Yes. So when we originally guided 6% to 8%, a few things were different. And we've tightened that to 6% to 7%. On the year, our business looks really healthy, and we're happy with how the business is progressing. But we are trying to be prudent about European demand and the currency impacts of what's going on in Europe. And then the third piece is we are more optimistic about the move to subscriptions and to the Creative Cloud, and that will have some impact on the revenue for the year as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'd just like to follow-up on Walter's question. Just specifically, of the 90,000 paid subscribers, how many of those were new to the franchise?","Shantanu Narayen","So Steve, let me take that question. I mean, first, in terms of the subscribers that we had coming into the quarter, there were approximately 30,000 coming into the quarter in terms of subscribers from the CS5.5 and earlier. And so we did see a good adoption. The other thing, I think, to remember that we're really very pleased about is when you look at the pipeline that we have for new subscribers, and these are both the people who have awareness as a result of the trials and the free downloads, that's a significant portion. And so as Mark, I think, also said in his prepared remarks, given the proportion that we're running, a number of the customers are adopting -- about 70% of them are adopting the lower promotional pricing. And of the rest, a significant portion are new to the franchise.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And could I just ask, if we were to look at the business by addition, if we were to look at the older CS4, CS3, when we see those people come forward and move to CS6, I think the expectation that we had, maybe you had, was that a large percentage who choose subscription are older customers. Is that indeed happening?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, the perpetual business is also very healthy. And again, I think it's important to remember that at this time, the only thing we're offering, Steve, is subscriptions to individual users. So I think it's important to remember as we actually think about subscriptions, that as we introduce the team offering and the Enterprise offering, we would expect to see more subscription adoption. And so at this point, the subscribers are primarily individual users, either former users or new people to the platform. Over time, certainly, we believe that it's in our best interest to move more and more people to the subscription because that makes it more loyal to Adobe.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk about the higher education business. Correct me if I'm wrong, but this is still, I think, one of your -- your #1 vertical and perhaps one of your largest revenue verticals. What you're planning for in the third quarter? And if you could just kind of walk you through what you expect on the perpetual versus subscription in that particular segment of the business?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So Brent, I mean, we would expect in Q3 to have a seasonal uptick relative to Q2 in the educational business. It certainly is the back-to-school part of the education business, which, as you correctly point out, is one of our largest verticals. And I think in terms of the mix, again, we would expect that individual students could start to adopt the subscription mix. We think it'll be on the same order as individual outside and the broader commercial space. But we would imagine that the Enterprise or, in this case, the education licensing business and the site license will continue to be the majority of the revenue in the quarter.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And Mark, I don't know if you can follow up just in terms of what is the percent of revenue that higher education represents? And I -- just one quick follow-up on the European demand. I would assume that this is just customers holding off rather than talking through [ph] a competitive solution. I guess, from your perspective, you're not seeing this spill into other territories, correct?","Mark Garrett","Correct. We haven't seen it spill into other territories. On the education side, Brent, we haven't really disclosed a number every quarter, but it's north of 10% as a vertical.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us some color...","Shantanu Narayen","Kash, we lost you.","Operator","We'll go to Peter Goldmacher with Cowen and Company.","Peter L. Goldmacher - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","In the Digital Marketing category, you have Digital Marketing -- you have the Digital Marketing Suite and then you have LiveCycle and Web conferencing. Digital Marketing Suite did well, and you've talked about stopping investing in LiveCycle and Web conferencing. But the sequential decline was pretty dramatic. Can you give us a little color on that, please?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So Peter, at the beginning of the year and at the Financial Analyst Meeting, we had talked about in both the LiveCycle and the Connect business to actually focus just on government and financial services. And for the year, we had mentioned that we would expect to see something like $150 million decline. It's actually probably a little bit even less than that. And so it's very much in line with the strategy to drive focus on Digital Marketing. And so we would continue to expect to see declines in the LiveCycle and Connect business moving forward as well.","Operator","And our next question is from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the Digital Media guidance for down sequential, I was wondering if that's driven by Document Services or is it more of a Europe commentary or really driven by the subscription revenue, which clearly you would recognize less of upfront. I'm curious to get your take on the mix behind the guide down because if I recollect right, in the prior cycle at CS5, your August quarter was actually sequentially up for Digital Media. I know that there's been a reclass, but it was up rather meaningfully sequentially. I'm just trying to get at what's different about this cycle versus the previous one.","Mark Garrett","Kash, it's Mark. Yes, you touched on both of the reasons. It is different this cycle. Like I said, we're optimistic about the move to subscriptions, and that might have some impact in the third quarter, as well as the fact that we're trying to be prudent about Europe, both from a demand perspective and from a currency perspective.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. Mark, at this point, the -- the mode of subscription, do you feel like  your revenue guidance for the year fully contains the transition to the subscription model? Or do you think that we need to see one more quarter before we can size up the subscription impact on your revenue growth rate this year?","Mark Garrett","We feel pretty good that we've now captured the impact to 2012 as people move to subscriptions based on the run rate that we had seen so far.","Shantanu Narayen","And maybe 2 other things to just add to that, Kash. Clearly, relative to what we had outlined at the Analyst Meeting in terms of the impact that we thought we would see in this year as we move to the subscription, we think subscription adoption is better than expected and what we had said at the Analyst Meeting. And therefore, the impact to revenue is higher. The other thing I'd just like to point out is that during the quarter, we launched both the perpetual as well as the subscription offerings. And it's gone extremely well from our point of view because we had to deliver all of the perpetual product. We've delivered individual subscriptions in over 30 countries via adobe.com and through some other partners. And the response actually of people who got subscriptions, their success rates are actually higher than all other traditional means. And so that really bodes well for customer sat [ph] and loyalty moving forward. And so I just wanted to point out that the execution on the move towards the Creative Cloud globally has actually gone really well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to go back to the subs question -- and apologize, I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing some of the answers. So if you said this, I apologize. But it sounds like you said 30,000 of the subs came from 5, which implies maybe 60,000 were net new. And, a, is that right? And if that's the case, can you update us on your thoughts for what you would expect to see seed growth be this fiscal year?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. So Adam, I think there are 2 questions in that. We had said that subscriptions moving forward, we are sort of modeling it for the time being given it's only the individual subscribers at about 5,000 a week moving forward. You did catch it right, we said we had about 30,000 coming into the quarter of CS5 and before subscribers. And your third question was?","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Oh, just update us on what you expect. You\u2019d given some parameters for what you expected seeds to do this year at the Analyst Day. How are you -- so what's  the updated target for seed growth?","Shantanu Narayen","And we're tracking to that. I think at the Analyst Day, we had said that we expect to see something like a 10% seed growth, and we think we're on track to accomplish that.","Operator","And we have a question from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Just to follow up on Adam's question. And not to belabor this, but specifically, I think you had said that -- and I know it's only 25 days shipping the product in the quarter, but the total seeds or total units were up just slightly from the CS5 launch. So we're trying to resolve that against what else was said and tracking to that 10% target, Shantanu, which you say is still on track. Is that -- should we then -- and for that -- the perpetual sales perhaps were less than you had expected in the quarter? Or is that not a fair conclusion?","Shantanu Narayen","I think, Brad, continuously comparing sort of units with the old models given some of the new offerings we have in subscriptions is actually going to be harder. What we were really trying to give you is a health of the business, which we feel the health is really strong in the business. Perpetual continues to do well as it relates to small and medium business and Enterprise. And individuals, the subscription offering is seeing an uptick that is higher than our projections. So what we were trying to do was give you a flavor, not just of units and subscriptions for individuals, but the overall business. And so we continue to be optimistic about this move towards the cloud as being the right strategic move for the company. In terms of total units, we had talked about how the cloud enables us to attract new customers and to drive seed growth. And again, in response to Adam's question, we think we're on track to accomplish that. That certainly includes units not just as part of subscriptions but also everything that we're doing with respect to Enterprise seed licenses.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","And just a separate topic I want to ask: how the acquisitions of Vitrue and Buddy Media changed the competitive dynamic around social marketing? I think Oracle and salesforce.com would argue that this capability is an extension of CRM. Is it an advantage or disadvantage to be selling this type of solution separate from a CRM Platform?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, a couple of responses to that. The first is it's clear that Digital Marketing as a category is absolutely heating up. And we continue to think that we're very, very well positioned in that entire space with respect to everything we offer. The content management business continues to do really well. Efficient Frontier, we had the best quarter in bookings in terms of Efficient Frontier. The integration between analytics and content management and the integration between analytics and multi-campaign -- multichannel campaign is going really well. So specifically as it relates to social, we introduced Adobe Social. And we think that since Adobe SiteCatalyst is widely deployed on all of these thousands of brand sites because we collect 1.6 trillion transactions, we're uniquely positioned, frankly, to correlate those social media mentions with the business metrics on the site. And that continues to be, from our point of view, a key thing from customers. The other thing we can actually do is demonstrate the impact on business results. We also now enable them to actually do the content creation through Context Optional. And we're the first and actually, I think, the only Facebook preferred marketing developer who supports all of Facebook's marketing APIs. So clearly, the space is heating up. I think different companies are going to come at it from the CRM point of view, the IP point of view and the marketer. We think we're uniquely positioned on the marketer and the content. And this is such an explosive space. I think all companies will continue to do well right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from Thomas Ernst with Deutsche Bank.","Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm curious what feedback you're getting from your Enterprise customers or your nonindividual customers regarding the Creative Cloud. What's your sense for the demand? Are they asking for the availability of cloud?","Shantanu Narayen","So Tom, what we're hearing from the Enterprise customers is the rapid innovation that we're going to be delivering as part of the Creative Cloud, they certainly want access to that. I would say the file storage capabilities, they not only want it with -- across the enterprise through Creative Cloud, they really want digital asset management through the Day solution. And so we've provided that. And so their content requirements and their app requirements, we're hearing more demand not just for the content creation tools but, frankly, for content management through Day as well as the Digital Publishing Suite set of solutions. So that's really what we continue to hear from the enterprise. And selling the entire solution, I think, is really resonating with them.","Thomas Ernst - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Do you -- as a follow-up to that, do you think that this might be something you pursue and open up ahead of the next major cycle?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, we'd intend to do that before the next major cycle, Tom. And for those of the customers who are on enterprise site license agreements, since they are on a per-seed basis, there really is no risk associated with them, whether they get the perpetual or the subscription, to get access to all of this technology.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two quick questions on it. The first is what drove the -- what looks like an increase in the cost of goods in the Digital Marketing? Is this one-time? Or should we see this as part of a bigger -- of a change in trend that we're going to need to model to a bigger cost?","Mark Garrett","This is Mark. On the Digital Marketing side, the cost is mainly around hosting. On the Digital Media side, COGS were up this quarter primarily due to the shipment of the CS6 product, things like localization, increased Shrink Wrap product that went out into the channel, things like that. Both of those are somewhat unique to this quarter.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And the second one is Mark, what data would you be able to supply us Q-over-Q the next couple of quarters to be able to model the growth in the subscription?","Mark Garrett","Well, we gave you quite a few numbers given the fact that the product has only been out for 4 or 5 weeks. As we move forward, we'll certainly continue to give you the numbers that we did this quarter, and we'll look to expand that as it starts to settle into a range that's a little more predictable. So you can look forward to us providing more information as we move forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions around 2 subjects that came up at the Digital Marketing Summit in Salt Lake a couple of months ago. First, Adobe mentioned in one of the presentations that adobe.com does over $0.5 billion in revenue. And the question first, Mark, is how are you thinking about the progression of adobe.com revenues this year and beyond when you take into account all the mix of upgrades plus subscription, plus perpetual? So can you talk about that outlook? And then secondly, for Shantanu, also at Salt Lake, there was a good amount of discussion about the integration plans you have between Creative Cloud and the Digital Marketing Suite. The question there is: Could you talk about some of the critical next steps along that integration path that you have for those 2 sides of the business?","Mark Garrett","Sure, Jay. It's Mark. So for adobe.com, directionally, we fully expect adobe.com to be a larger and larger percentage of our business, especially as we move more and more subscription people over onto adobe.com. It gives us a one-to-one relationship with our customers that we don't always get when product is sold elsewhere. And frankly, it's better margin as well. So we would expect that business to grow going forward without a doubt.","Shantanu Narayen","And Jay, on the second question as it relates to the integration plans, I mean, there are probably 3 key areas that we focus on right now both between the Digital Marketing Suite and across them, which is content management and analytics. That's been a huge customer request, which is if they are implementing the content management system to make sure there's analytics associated with it. I would say the second one has been with content creation tools, the CS tools, and digital asset management so that all of the content that we are creating is automatically stored in these digital asset management areas. And so you can consider that an integration between CS as well as the Day content management repository. And the third, I would say, and it\u2019s related to the question that was asked earlier, is everything to do with analytics and measuring whether it's marketing spend or conversion. So I would say the integration's going really quite well. We will continue to push on it. And we just -- there's so many ideas on the table. I'll put one more out there. Virtually every customer is interested in also exploring Digital Publishing Suite because they all recognize that they have to publish things not just on their website through Day or on social sites through Context Optional but also increasingly through app stores using the Digital Publishing Suite. And so that's clearly another area of integration between the content creation tools and our services.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, just one follow-up on the subscriber numbers that you talked about earlier. At the Analyst Meeting, you mentioned that you had a new subscriber goal of 800,000 by 2015. If all we do is just extrapolate the 5,000 a week that you've been seeing, then you get there by early 2015 assuming no change in the 5,000 a week. Is there any reason to believe from the pipeline comments you made that you should, in fact, see some step-up in the net adds of subscribers and perhaps you hit that 800,000 goal sooner than 2015?","Shantanu Narayen","So Jay, firstly, as Mark said, I think it's really early. We've only introduced the individual offering. We haven't yet introduced the team. We haven't yet introduced the enterprise. As we committed to at the Analyst Meeting, we wanted to give you some color, but we will have to wait and see a couple of quarters to see the mix, how this all plays out. What we clearly wanted to share, what -- overall feedback has been really positive. And the fact is that people are looking at this as a natural way. We've talked about piracy. We're definitely hearing anecdotal evidence that people who pirated copies in the past are now wanting to become legitimate by paying the monthly fee. And so it's all off to a good start, but I think it's too early to project 2015 right now.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","On the Creative Cloud in talking with volume resellers, I think there is a lot of Enterprise interested in that. So when that does become available for volume license distribution, as you indicated would happen maybe sometime before the next version launch, would you anticipate a material acceleration in Creative Cloud uptake rate, potentially accelerating later in the year, whenever it is launched, above the 5,000 new subscriptions per week that you're seeing at the end of the May quarter?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. So Mike, the 5,000 is only as it relates to individual subscribers. And yes, we would expect acceleration when the other offerings come to market because the numbers there are -- for individual customer do tend to be large.","Michael E. Hoffman - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, what was the -- if you could share, what was the recurring revenue as a percent of overall in the May quarter? I think it was 23% last quarter. I'm just wondering if you can just give an equivalent metric for Q2.","Mark Garrett","Yes, this is Mark. It was 23% last quarter. It's about 23% again this quarter. Keep in mind that the subscription revenue from the cloud really doesn't impact our financials this quarter at all because obviously, the offering was late in the quarter and it takes a while to ramp up from a revenue perspective. One other thing while I'm on this that I should mention is if you look at deferred revenue, we had a nice, healthy deferred revenue increase, which is great. Deferred revenue does not, and will not, include cloud revenue because we bill on a monthly basis. We don't bill in advance even for the annual subscriptions. So I just want to make sure you understand not to look at deferred revenue as some metric to figure out future cloud revenue.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies & Co.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I just had one follow-up from the Digital Media business. I think you said 90,000 subscribers and 30,000 coming from the CS5.5 or earlier, which implies 60,000 from CS6. But if the run rate is about 5,000 a week, I'm just curious as to whether that math is right. And was there a bulge at the front? Or is there some other reason why that 60,000 number has happened over a 4- or 5-week period?","Mark Garrett","Ross, it's Mark. Those numbers are correct. And yes, we did have an initial spike when we first launched the product, and then we've settled into the 5,000.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one follow-up. As you thought about making some slight adjustments for the full year, you talked about Europe demand, FX and then better adoption of the Creative Cloud. And I think from our own work, and I think you said 70% of existing customers seem to be driven by the promotional pricing, could you help us understand the weight of those 2 items, Europe plus FX, as one versus the higher proportion moving to subscription? Any sort of sense of that sort of mix, if you will?","Mark Garrett","Well, if you look at the fact that we had a $10 million impact in terms of overachievement in the second quarter, you can use that as a surrogate for what that might mean going forward. We took 1 point, if you will, off the top end of the range. We didn't lower the range. We just took 1 point off the top of it. And you can look at $10 million impact in the second quarter as a surrogate to come up with what the subscription impact might be as you go forward. And then the rest is Europe and FX.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had 2 do in particular, just to follow up to some of the ones people were asking. Where in particular are you seeing demand for Creative Cloud? I was just wondering if you could characterize the customers for us that are coming into that fold? And then also, Shantanu, you said comparing units to the old model is going to be hard. What, in your opinion, should we be using to judge the performance of CS6 collectively then?","Shantanu Narayen","So Heather, first, with respect to the interest and demand that we're getting for our Creative Cloud, it's actually very broad based. The number of customers who've signed on for the free membership, the trial downloads, the volumes associated with that has been broad. It's across multiple countries in which we are offering it; and it's across multiple customer segments, so whether you consider them imaging or video or folks who are creating web applications; and it's across all of the individual point products as well, which suggest that it's a broad-based demand right now for the Creative Cloud. The thing I will remind everybody who's listening is that it is so early, and none of them have actually seen the amount of innovation that we can add on a monthly and a quarterly basis. And so I think the beauty of the Creative Cloud offering really is that it feeds on itself with respect to all of the new innovation that we can provide. And we're so early. While we have a road map for all of that development, it really hasn't materialized yet. And so we think that, that actually should help accelerate adoption of the Creative Cloud, as well as when we move people through the funnel because there is a significant amount of awareness of the Creative Cloud. With respect to your second question on units, as Mark said in his prepared remarks, the way we look at performance is going to be a combination of the perpetual revenue, the site license revenue as well as subscription. So we'll start to give you that data as the quarters proceed. And so you have to look at all of that cumulatively as you get a true state of the business.","Operator","And our last question will come from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mark, you just -- your recent comments here in the last question or 2, you talked about not reading too much into a deferred revenue move. I'm wondering. I know you don't give financial targets for deferred revs, but can you talk to us directionally on how you think that will trend? And then also, maybe just directionally help us understand how you think cash flow will trend given the mix versus subscription and perpetual. It'd be helpful.","Mark Garrett","Yes, sure. So like I said, deferred revenue, you can see, was up $44 million. That's driven by the Omniture and the Digital Marketing businesses that are subscription-oriented businesses and substantial ones today, as well as maintenance and support. And we actually also have from time to time some royalty contracts in the Print and Publishing business that get renewed and they're booked to deferred and then recognized ratably over time. I would expect over a longer period that deferred revenue will continue to go up. I think next quarter, it's conceivable that it's flat to maybe even slightly down next quarter, just because of this royalty contract that got renewed this quarter. And that was worth -- I'll tell you that was worth $13 million in deferred. Of the $44 million, $13 million was from a royalty contract in Print and Publishing. So that would come out next quarter, and we might see it slightly down. But over the longer period, I would fully expect deferred revenue to continue to increase even though Creative Cloud subscriptions won't be reflected in deferred because we've got the Digital Market business, which is going to be a very large SaaS business moving forward. And then from a cash flow perspective, I don't foresee any changes in the near term. We continue to have a very healthy cash generating business model, and I fully expect that to continue. One thing I did want to add before I turn the call to Shantanu to wrap up is I think there's been some question about the Digital Marketing revenue, and I just want to make sure, if you look at the data sheet, that you understand that Digital Marketing includes the LiveCycle and Connect businesses. And if you look at our supplementary data, it's a better way to look at those businesses so that you can see how much was LiveCycle and Connect and how much is what we call the Digital Marketing Suite revenue, which is the Omniture products and the WEM products together, which is really where the growth is going to come from.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mark. Again, I think at the beginning of the year, we had talked about 2 key goals for the company. We were going to move the Creative business to the cloud to attract new customers, to make that far more predictable and to continue to drive innovation. And while early, we think we're off to a really successful start with respect to the Creative Cloud introduction that we've seen so far. As we've said, subscriptions are ahead of track, and we have now a platform on which we can build to drive continuous innovation. The second goal that we had talked about was focusing on this fast-growing category of Digital Marketing. It's clear that that's spanning out and that the acquisitions and the organic innovation that we have done position us very well. As Mark said, we've had 35% year-over-year growth in revenue in that category. The pipeline is healthy. And so while there was some softness in Europe, we do not think that it impacts our confidence, both in our strategy as well as in our execution. So thank you for joining us today.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call.

We achieved $1.27 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q3, a 28% year-over-year increase. We exited the quarter with over $4.87 billion of Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q3 was $308 million, and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud businesses.","Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and we increased revenue 33% year-over-year in Q3. Creative Cloud growth was driven by net-new subscriptions, continued focus on customer value that fuels retention, adoption of enterprise services, and focus on high-potential segments like education. The video category is exploding and we continue to drive strong growth with our market-leading Creative Cloud video solutions. At the IBC Conference in Amsterdam, we highlighted our latest innovations in virtual reality, animation, motion graphics, editing, collaboration and Adobe Stock video.","We unveiled new premium features in Adobe Spark, a family of easy-to-use services for creating high-quality social graphics, web pages and video stories. Spark with premium features is now available as a standalone subscription, and is also included in our Creative Cloud All Apps subscription. In addition to Adobe XD for Experience Design and Project Felix for 2D to 3D photo-realistic rendering, we are driving innovation to enable authoring for emerging media types such as AR and VR. We recently acquired best-in-class 360-degree and virtual reality software from Mettle.

In Q3, Document Cloud revenue was $206 million, a year-over-year increase of 10%, and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $556 million exiting the quarter. We drove strong uptake of Acrobat across both Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud.","Adobe Sign is helping drive Adobe Document Cloud ARR growth. Earlier this month, we announced Adobe Sign is now Microsoft\u2019s preferred e-signature solution across the company\u2019s portfolio, including the 100 million monthly commercial active users of Microsoft Office 365.","Adobe Scan is at the heart of our mobile PDF creation strategy. Adobe Scan has had over 2.7 million downloads across iOS and Android, delivering revolutionary scanning and text-recognition capabilities through integration with Adobe Document Cloud.","The leader in the Digital Marketing category, Adobe Experience Cloud is enabling enterprises to deliver intelligent, intuitive and effective customer experiences. We achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $508 million in Q3, which represents 26% year-over-year revenue growth.","The breadth of Adobe Experience Cloud, which includes Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud, is enabling us to address an expanding array of customer experience categories.

With the world\u2019s best employees, partners and customers, we are equipped to continue to deliver on our mission and look forward to a strong close to our fiscal year. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY17, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.84 billion, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $0.84 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.10.","Highlights in Q3 included record Creative revenue of $1.06 billion, strong Document Cloud revenue of $206 million, strong net new Digital Media ARR of $308 million, record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $508 million, strong year-over-year growth in operating profit and net income, record deferred revenue of $2.2 billion, more than $700 million in cash flow from operations, and a record 88% of revenue during the quarter came from recurring sources.","In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 28% year-over-year. The addition of $308 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.87 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $1.06 billion which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $272 million during Q3 and exited the quarter with $4.32 billion of Creative ARR.","Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strength with Creative Cloud across all segments, including individual, team and enterprise. Notable Q3 highlights included the achievement of strong net new subscriptions; maintaining or growing ARPU across all key Creative Cloud offerings and strength in Japan.","With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $206 million, and Document Cloud ARR grew to $556 million exiting Q3. Across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, Acrobat adoption accelerated again when compared to recent quarters, achieving 19% year-over-year unit growth. In addition, our electronic signature service Adobe Sign continues to show strength and we expect the recent partnership we announced with Microsoft to fuel growth of Adobe Sign moving forward.","In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $508 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. Notable areas of strength include Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Campaign, and Adobe Advertising Cloud. We now have approximately $3 billion of annualized ad spend across search, social, display and video. Mobile remains a key driver for our Experience Cloud business; mobile data transactions grew to 57% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter.","Overall interest in digital marketing and Adobe Experience Cloud is strong, and we continue to drive subscription bookings growth. The scale of our engagements is growing with customers increasingly adopting multiple Adobe solutions which is leading to larger deal sizes but longer sales cycles. As a result, we did not achieve our Q3 bookings goal and are no longer on track to achieve our 30% net new ASV bookings growth target for the year. However, we do expect greater than 20% organic annual growth in FY17 on the subscription book of business.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $9.6 million. We had $200,000 in hedge gains in Q3 FY17, versus $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY17; thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $3.5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $11.3 million. We had $200,000 in hedge gains in Q3 FY17, versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY16; thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $15 million.","In Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 22.5% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was slightly lower than targeted due to stronger-than-forecasted profits from outside the U.S., as well as certain tax benefits we were entitled to claim upon filing our U.S. income tax returns. Our trade DSO was 50 days, which compares to 45 days in the year-ago quarter, and 46 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.2 billion, up 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in Digital Media. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $5.4 billion. Cash flow from operations was $704 million in the quarter.","In Q3, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares at a cost of $298 million. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining of our $2.5 billion stock repurchase authority granted in January 2017.","I will now provide our financial outlook. In Q4 FY17, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.950 billion; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $330 million; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%; Adobe Experience Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 17%; as a reminder, last quarter we outlined that the Experience Cloud Q4 FY17 year-over-year growth rate will be affected by a material amount of perpetual revenue that we achieved in Q4 FY16; share count of approximately 500 million shares; net non-operating expense of approximately $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis; tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.86, and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.15.","Our Q4 targets, combined with our year-to-date performance, would yield the following annual FY17 revenue results: Total Digital Media segment growth of approximately 26%; total Adobe Experience Cloud growth of approximately 24%; and total Adobe growth of approximately 24%. Our strong results coupled with our Q4 targets demonstrate that FY17 will be another record year for Adobe. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks, Mark.

I\u2019m wondering, Shantanu, on the digital marketing performance. I noticed one product that wasn\u2019t mentioned as strong in the quarter was Experience Manager. If you go into some detail as to whether or not weakness in that product was because of what you saw -- and I know, what you mentioned on the larger transactions, but was there any sort of product maturity issues you were facing there?

I mean, we wanted to be clear in our communication that Q3 subscription bookings were below our expectations, but that in no way diminishes both, our excitement around the opportunity and how we\u2019re helping companies deal with digital transformation.","And when you see the minor impact of that Q3 bookings to our Q4 revenue target, you\u2019ll see that we\u2019re still targeting 24% revenue growth in fiscal 2017. So, as we think about providing a little bit more color on how we inspect that business, as you know, Walter, there are three components to the Experience Cloud. There is the non-recurring revenue sources including perpetual and that\u2019s now de minimis in the consulting services. The largest part of the business is now represented by our subscription based model in both marketing cloud and analytics cloud. And growth there is best described I think by net growth on the book of business at the beginning of the year, and that\u2019s very similar to how we describe Digital Media ARR. That continues to grow and we are expecting that book of business to grow organically at greater than 20% this year.","So, the fact that we highlighted revenue in certain categories, has nothing to do with an implication that there was revenue weakness in AEM. So, wanted to get that out there.","In Advertising Cloud, the business model again, as you know is the traditional usage based model and\/or percentage of advertising spend. This includes an organic -- inorganic compare in FY17 but again, that will grow substantially over 30% this year. And so, the way we think about it, the 30% target that we had given was actually based on a different methodology which was prior to the acquisition of TubeMogul and was blended across both the subscription and the usage based models, and was actually growth on top of last year\u2019s growth in the business as opposed to just net growth on the beginning book of business.","So, the business remains healthy. There were some large deals that were taking longer. But we expect the traditional year-end strength across Experience Cloud will lead to a substantial increase in sequential bookings from Q3 to Q4, which was the last part of your question, very stringent focus on execution, and we remain excited about the business. We will probably provide an update to you guys at MAX as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent your line is open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Shantanu, just to follow up on Experience Cloud. There was some concern that you pulled the target that may be these larger deals will take longer than Q4 to close. Can you just comment in terms of what you are seeing in the pipeline or are these just pushing from Q3 to Q4 or do you anticipate a push into the fiscal year? And then, just a quick follow-up. There has been a lot of talk about iOS 11 and the blocking of cookies and ads, as well as the weakness that\u2019s been found in some of the ad agencies as of late. Is there anything else going, maybe outside your control that you are seeing that\u2019s new, that we should take into account?","Shantanu Narayen","As it relates to the Q3 pipeline, that did not close, it\u2019s primarily moved to Q4, it has nothing to do. We still remain the leader in the category and it\u2019s not competitive. So, we expect the traditional year-end strength across Experience Cloud will lead, as I said earlier, to the substantial increase in sequential bookings. But we are also anticipating that as a result of the larger deals, there is a possibility that we will continue to see an ongoing larger sales cycle that might lead to a phase shift in terms of when the bookings are closed. And so, we don\u2019t think that the fundamental opportunity has changed.","With respect to the Advertising Cloud, we had a strong quarter. And as I said, the business is growing substantially over 30% this year. So, no impact yet in terms of what we are seeing with respect to cookies or iOS. The advertising spend, I think Mark also spoke to in his prepared remarks, we have a significant amount of dollars under marketing spend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Sterling, your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Just want to continue that line of questions. Shantanu, you mentioned that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s competitive, but still want to try to zero in, is there any more color as to why the extension or the lengthening of sales cycle, whether the approval process, rethinking in terms of the direction that customers are taking some of their spend, because I know, we\u2019re going to hit that question allow, which is why? Why do you think, you\u2019re seeing the lengthening sales cycle and spillover in some of these deals?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, one thing, Sterling, that is happening is given that these are much larger deals, the number of approvals that you need within an enterprise is extending beyond the marketing person who is responsible for this activity. And so, as we were targeting the Chief Revenue Officer, the Chief Digital Officer that was a single point of approval, now there may be a couple of points of approval. But beyond that, it\u2019s just the bigger engagements, is resulting in more people in an organization, who are responsible for digital transformation and being involved in the process.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. I think people agreed [ph] too much into this as opposed to the fact that, we are being as candid and transparent as we always are. The big term opportunity remains exactly the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC. Ross, your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Mark, maybe one of your. Just, this year has obviously been a really strong year in Digital Media ARR. I think the net add in your forecast is going to be above 1.2 billion, which is actually higher than we\u2019ve seen in the past two years. I\u2019m just -- I know you\u2019re not guiding for next year, but just to help us think about the shape of the curve on the net new ARR, because we\u2019ve been sort of hanging out above a 1 billion now for three years. Is it something you think is sustainable or should we start thinking about the potential for the net new ARR to begin to come down. Maybe just help us think about that because there is a lot of factors obviously that play into that number?","Mark Garrett","Yes. We\u2019re very pleased with ARR and we\u2019re very pleased with the fact, to your point Ross, that we\u2019ve been able to continue to add over $1 billion every year. And as you know, it comes from three big groups. So, we\u2019re still migrating the base over, there is still opportunity there. We continue to attract more and more new users, and that remains a very big opportunity, and we continue to sell services. So, those three growth vectors still play out very nicely. We don\u2019t really see any change in that right now. We are very pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to do. And as Shantanu laid out on the marketing side, this 1 billion plus dollars that we\u2019re adding every year is an increase to our book of business, which is how we were trying to explain the way we will begin to look at digital marketing. So, no change to the trajectory from our perspective.","Shantanu Narayen","And also Ross, more nascent businesses like Adobe Stock and Adobe Sign are continuing to perform really well, international expansion continues to grow, and new customer acquisition, so as well as enterprise services. So, continued focus on that. And last but certainly not least, you can see that impact of Acrobat on that overall business continues to be strong. Acrobat had a strong business in both, Document Cloud as well as in the Creative Cloud.","Mark Garrett","And not to pile on, but we also continue to see an opportunity to combat piracy and drive more into education. So, there is just a lot of growth vectors left in this business.","Ross MacMillan","Yes. That\u2019s very clear. Thank you. And then, just quick follow-up on marketing. The 30% number is a big one. And as you mentioned, that was a kind of combined -- sorry for the background noise, combined on the advertising as well as sort of underlying prior assets. Just as you\u2019re thinking about that business, do you think a 20% growth in sort of new ACV [ph] is a reasonable way to think about at that? Do you think that\u2019s high, do you think that\u2019s potentially low? Just maybe little bit of framework around what you think is sustainable one kind of new ACV [ph] basis that will be helpful. Thank you. ","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. I think, first, Ross, the market opportunity continues to be incredibly large. I think we\u2019ve talked about 40 billion TAM. I think you\u2019ve got it exactly when you talked about, that was a growth-on-growth number as opposed to just a percentage growth on the book-of-business. And so, when we look at it as a percentage growth on the book-of-business which is similar to what we do in digital media, as I said, the Marketing Cloud and Analytics Cloud will grow greater than 20% then the Advertising Cloud is going to be substantially greater than 30%. And so relative to the market opportunity, we continue to think that there is headroom for us and we continue to be the leader.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital. Saket, your line is open.","Saket Kalia","Sure. Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. Just to change gears a little bit towards Creative. Shantanu or Mark, can you just talk a little bit about Adobe Stock? I realize that you won\u2019t give the contribution to ARR. Could you maybe talk qualitatively about whether customers are asking for monthly or annual plans and maybe what price spans are proven to be more popular?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. With respect to Adobe Stock, we just continue to think it\u2019s a significant opportunity for us. Big picture, we offer it both in conjunction with the Creative Cloud all apps as well as we offer it as a subscription. We have actually tapered down the on-demand part of the Adobe Stock in favor of the subscription, so that it becomes a recurring part of the business. I think it\u2019s clear when you look at the other stock content services that the growth in that category, we are continuing to drive it. We\u2019ve added new capabilities in video as well. But the business is growing well for us across our offerings which are primarily subscription based offerings.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Heather, your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you. I was wondering, Shantanu, if you could help share some color with us on the cross-sell and up-sell trends you\u2019ve been seeing in the Creative Cloud community. And also wondering if you look forward, what do you see is being a bigger driver of growth? Can you help us think about just directionally, net new subs contribution versus cross-sell? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Heather. When we look at the business, I think as we add new categories of products in the authoring space, whether it\u2019s Adobe XD, or whether it\u2019s what we are doing with Project Felix and as we think about AR and VR, the first that we can continue to do is think about is it time to also offer another premium Creative Cloud service that can drive and up-sell in terms of ARR. We continue to see good adoption of new single apps as was also evident in the Creative Suite business of old. That\u2019s the way in which people enter the platform and then, we move them from single app to the entire Creative Cloud offering.","Services, the ARPU in the enterprise continues to grow as people adopt the services. And we are certainly in the process and have seen success in attaching whether it\u2019s Stock or whether it\u2019s Sign to those Creative Could enterprise term license agreements. We haven\u2019t yet started even looking at pricing, which continues to be a big opportunity for us in terms of optimizing pricing because we are trying to get more and more people to the platform.","So, I think net international expansion, Mark talked about education and piracy, it\u2019s -- the nature of everybody who has a story to tell is just expanding. I am excited about Spark and now offering Spark as a premium feature, which we think there should be a significantly larger set of people who would be interested in Spark.","So, across all of those dimensions Heather, the cross-sell of people who have the applications through mobile and stock, the upsell from individual users to the entire suite and also from enterprises, not only adopting asset management and Creative Cloud ETLAs but also adopting the Marketing Cloud, I think all of those continue to be areas of focus and execution for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash your line is open.","Kash Rangan","Hi, thanks. A good segue way to Heather\u2019s question. I was looking to see, given your exceptional track record in being able to lay out longer term targets and being able to hit that with a lot of panache and style. How should we think about Adobe\u2019s growth opportunities ahead? Is it -- the way you answered Heather\u2019s question, the different vectors, is that the next third chapter, if you will, of your long-term planning that is going to give us the comfort in your ability to sustain this growth? [Ph] because there is not maybe a widely held belief but in maybe some pockets of the investor community that once you hit the full penetration in Creative, whenever the time, it\u2019s 2018 or 2019 that growth will decelerate and therefore Adobe is going to have to do something to keep that growth rate. Just curious how we should think about it and you think about it, more importantly? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","I think, at our analyst meetings, we always take it upon ourselves to talk about our long-term growth opportunities, whether they\u2019d be in Creative, Document or Marketing Cloud. And as we talk about the large TAM available to us, it\u2019s clear actually that we are executing against all three of those. And so, we will continue to provide updates at MAX. But from the point of view of your specific question around Creative, we think we are so early in the adoption of our Creative Cloud applications and services and mobile and new forms of offering that any concern associated with sort of migration being the only fuel of the business, we should have put that to bed a long time ago in terms of the new customer acquisition and the new services that are driving the growth. So, a multiple opportunities. I hope you are coming to MAX where you will see a lot of the tremendous innovation, and we\u2019ll again outline all of the growth vectors that are available for us.","Kash Rangan","MAX in Vegas, tough combination to be, we\u2019ll be there.","Mark Garrett","I was going to say, Kash, we both touched on it separately but if you just list out all the different opportunities in Creative to grow the business, whether it\u2019s people coming from the base, new users or services, and then pricing opportunity, international opportunity, piracy opportunity, education opportunity, international opportunity -- I said that one, there\u2019s just a lot of different opportunities to continue to grow this business for quite a while from our perspective?","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Holt from MoffettNathanson. Adam, your line is open.","Adam Holt","A very good quarter from a cash flow perspective, and I was hoping maybe you could detail a little bit, what drove that, specifically around the deferred revenue lines. I wanted to know, are you seeing any benefit -- are you making any changes [Technical Difficulty]? And then, secondly\u2026","Shantanu Narayen","Adam, you\u2019re fading. Can you be just a little bit closer to the mic, please?","Adam Holt","Sure. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes.","Adam Holt","So, a very good quarter from a cash flow perspective, and I wanted to drill down on what\u2019s driving deferred revenue. Specifically, have you started to see any impact of maybe better duration from your billings, moving people from monthly and quarterly to annual, and how do you think that plays out going forward?","Mark Garrett","As it relates to the Creative business -- so first of all, Adam, congrats on the new job, welcome back.","Adam Holt","Thank you.","Mark Garrett","As a relates to the Creative business, most people are on an annual plan already. So that gets factored into deferred revenue already. The beauty of our business and you guys all know this, but the beauty of our business overall is that you\u2019ve got two businesses, three businesses growing very nicely and two of which just are amazingly profitable businesses that drive a lot of cash flow, and that\u2019s going to continue. So, we\u2019re thrilled with the cash flow; that is one of the beautiful parts of our business, and that will continue. But, as it relates to deferred, most people are already on an annual plan on the creative side. So, it\u2019s really factored in there.","Adam Holt","If I could just ask a quick follow-up to what you talked about moments earlier. Would you expect relationship [technical difficulty] bookings change going forward?","Mark Garrett","To the extent that we in a quarter come up a little short on bookings like we did this quarter, you\u2019re going to come up a little short on invoicing and you\u2019re going to come up a little sure on deferred. And that\u2019s why we said, in the deferred, most of what you saw there was Digital Media related. So, there is definitely a correlation there. But again, none of the fundamentals of the business have changed, none of the opportunity has changed. This is from our perspective, just a short-term change to drive larger transactions in the enterprise.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay, your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Shantanu, Mark, without meaning to suggest anything about the new customer acquisition, I\u2019d like to ask about you of various opportunities in upgrading and migrating several large basis. Specifically, if you could comment on for instance, the opportunity to upgrade or migrate CC Team to CCE; by our calculation about a quarter of the CC subscriber base is using the full product on teams, that seems just a pretty substantial base upgrade opportunity. Similarly, the years after you grew AEM after the acquisition of Day, you still sold a substantial amount of your life cycle business. We calculate roughly $0.5 billion or more over a period of half a decade, even as AEM was growing. So, again, there too seems to be a substantial migration opportunity. And then, lastly, with respect to Doc Cloud, which has always been your bigger base, do you think that the new PDF to point out spec could engender a new growth cycle for Acrobat either within the base or for new customers?","Shantanu Narayen","So, Jay, I\u2019ll go third backwards. And so first on Acrobat, I think we\u2019ve said in the past, we had over 30 million installations of Acrobats. So clearly that represents a large opportunity. I think mobile PDF creation with what we\u2019ve done with Adobe Scan and the ability for all of those assets to be in the cloud and to use Adobe Sensei to do things like OCR, clearly we see large opportunity. That business has migrated faster than we would have thought to subscription based business while we are growing the overall base. So, large opportunity, continue to be focused on it, and clearly, I think to your point, we are much earlier in the cycle in terms of migrating.","I think as for the second one that you talked about within the enterprise, the opportunity associated with how people move from traditional lifecycle to new forms capabilities in the AEM stack, absolutely that continues to be a large opportunity as people are moving from paper to digital, the ability to now electronic signatures which completes the last mile of that workflow is again an opportunity whether that\u2019s in government or whether that\u2019s in enterprises that are regulated, continues to be a large opportunity. And on the CC Team versus CCE, we look at that a little bit more honestly as a buying preference that people have where some people are buying CC Team and they are getting that fulfilled through the channel, and others are CC Enterprise and want the direct relationship with the customer and with Adobe in that particular case. In both those scenarios, we\u2019re focused on up-selling services as opposed to migrating them from one buying vehicle to another buying vehicle. So, on that one, I would say, the focus is more on how do we get both of those categories to buy more of the services rather than necessarily transition them at their preferences buying through the channel or adobe.com to having that CC Enterprise relationship with Adobe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Keith, your line is open.","Keith Weiss","I wanted to ask a couple of bigger picture questions. One is on Sensei, with respect to you\u2019ve got some positive feedback on Sensei, particularly in the broader Experience Cloud. Could you guys talk to us a little bit about sort of what you\u2019re hearing back from customers? And also remind us kind of how the monetization strategy around Sensei is going to be evolving as we move forward?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Keith. I mean, as it relates to Sensei, I mean, we\u2019ve had as we\u2019ve outlined on many occasions, decades of significant expertise, whether it\u2019s an understanding video, understanding images, understanding the semantic meaning of documents, and on the Experience Cloud side everything to do with predicting based on these large data sets, behavior that will drive otpizmation of business outcomes on behalf of our customers. And as we embed more and more of that intelligence that people have access to directly in how they use their products, I think the aha moment is going. I think people have that more and more on the creative side when they saw the magic that they saw within our products. And now what we are doing is actually ensuring that the ability for them to action all of the insights that we are getting is far more within the hands of the users. So, as you point out, the feedback that we are getting on Sensei across all of our offerings is very positive.","I do want to clarify one issue as it relates to the question around monetization of intelligence in our applications is there are other companies that are saying we\u2019re going to monetize the intelligence separately, does that mean that their other applications and dumb and don\u2019t have actually the functionality. So, for us we just look at all of the technology that we are putting in and it\u2019s making our existing products that are already world class better. So that\u2019s the way I look at it. We are not going to go and say you can buy the non-intelligent product for a $1 and you can buy the additional intelligent product for additional $1 amount. That makes no sense whatsoever, Keith. But the intelligence is being appreciated. We are investing very deeply in it. And from our point of view, the best is getting better.","Keith Weiss","And perhaps one follow-up on distribution. We heard about sort of an expansion of the ETLA program, trying to sort of [technical difficulty] put more customers into it. Can you talk a little bit about that expansion of ETLAs and whether sort of the initial feedback has been -- whether you\u2019ve been successful on getting more customers on to that program?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Keith. I think we\u2019ve had tremendous success with actually migrating people from the traditional way of procuring the Creative applications from us into ETLAs. And I think we have described in the past how the first version of that ETLA was in effect mimicking the sort of different solutions that they got in Creative suite. In other words, Creative suite was available as a design collection or as a master collection or as a video collection, and the first versions of ETLAs in terms of doing no harm, we were just providing an equivalent way for them to license the Creative Cloud applications.","The second wave of that as they are rolling off the three years, we have been very active in up-selling them into the Creative Cloud Complete application which is an increase in ARPU for us as well as selling them new services like Stock and Sign, which is additional revenue. And so, the way we measure the business and I look at this all the time, is migrating all ETLA customers first to Creative Cloud, then to Creative Cloud Complete and then monitoring usage of not just Creative Cloud all of our applications but also monitoring Stock as well as Sign. And so, we are well on our way to the journey, which is leading to better satisfaction on the part of our customers and clearly increase revenue and ARPU to us here at the Adobe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen and Co. Derrick your line is open.","Derrick Wood","Great, thanks. Back on the marketing side. And it seems like there is more companies forming a position for the Chief Data Officer. I know you guys have all had the era of the Chief Marketing Officer, but I would think as data has become more important in the marketing investments, you guys start to have more engagement with the CDO. So, I guess what I am trying to get at is, do you think that may be an element of longer sales cycles? And if so, do you think you need to change or expand your account coverage capacity to sell in through a different approval point or do you feel like you\u2019re entrenched enough with large accounts that the rate of investment doesn\u2019t need to change much?","Shantanu Narayen","Good question, Derrick. I think we are definitely entrenched in the accounts where the selling motion or process doesn\u2019t have to change as a result of what we are seeing because they know about us; the cycle may take a little bit longer.","With respect to your second question, there is no doubt that there is additional scrutiny on ensuring whatever the frameworks are to protect the data appropriately. If you go to our website, you\u2019ll see were leader and whether it\u2019s FedRAMP and the government or looking at it as HIPAA or healthcare and ensuring that all of those standards as part of Adobe\u2019s security framework and our data privacy framework that we\u2019ve taken the lead on that.","I think the third part of your question associated with are we then finding ways that enable our customers to monetize the insight associated with that data, that\u2019s clearly something that we\u2019ve been doing for a while including with the data co-op go up that we\u2019ve announced in terms of being able to monetize their data. So at all three levels, we feel confident. Namely, we have the right people on the table, we deal with all of the checkless items that are important for them to feel comfortable with our solutions, and we\u2019re providing business value and business outcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore. Kirk, your line is open.","Tom Mao","This is Tom Mao, calling in for Kirk. Just from the product side. Can you talk about some of the updates to your 360\/VR technology apart from Mettle? What kind of impact could we start to see in 2018 and how do you think about the TAM of those segments today?","Shantanu Narayen","Within the Creative Cloud, I think we\u2019ve touched on the fact that video is clearly the most exclusive category that we\u2019re seeing, IBC was another great opportunity for us. Within video, we had already added some 360\/VR capabilities. The technology that we\u2019ve acquired also was available as plug-ins to some of our applications. But as we have done traditionally, we take those plug-ins and apply that natively, because then the performance is significantly better and the usability of that functionality is better.","So big picture, we look at it saying, video is certainly exploding with the leaders in that video as Apple and other companies do a lot more innovation on things as AR and VR, extending our existing applications and continuously looking at new opportunities like we did with Project Felix to enable people to author [ph] for those. There is no question that\u2019s going to lead to both an increased set of new users as well as established users asking from Adobe support for all of those new media types. So both represent long-term opportunities for us, and we\u2019re pleased with the performance.","Tom Mao","And just a quick follow-up. It looks like your sales and marketing expense grew 14% year-on-year. Can you talk about where you are in terms of adding sales capacity on digital marketing side and how, we should think about that initiative, as we head into 2018?","Mark Garrett","Yes. It\u2019s Mark. We\u2019ve said for a while now that our incremental spend, if you look at it quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year, is going to be primarily in sales and marketing and R&D. And we\u2019re going to need to continue to invest in sales and marketing to drive both, awareness on the Creative Cloud side and sales capacity on the digital marketing side. So, I don\u2019t foresee that changing, especially as you look out and we continue to drive growth in both of those businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nate Cunningham from Guggenheim. Nate, your line is open.","Nate Cunningham","Shantanu, on the marketing side of the business, what do you see as the strategic gaps in your portfolio? And what are some areas where we could see you either partnering or making acquisitions in the future?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, let\u2019s start with the partnering. We clearly see an opportunity with Microsoft to partner. We have -- that\u2019s far more than a press release, we\u2019re open for business on that particular front, both with AEM and with Campaign in terms of managed service implementation on Azure and integration with Dynamics as well as integration with the PowerBI is certainly an opportunity. That pipeline is growing very healthily. We will be at Microsoft events. I think they\u2019ve been participating in the Adobe events. So, on partnership wide, we have a platform that enables a number of small startups to also benefit from and leverage our data assets. That\u2019s the one that I would highlight first and foremost.","With respect to M&A, I\u2019m certainly not going to highlight for the smaller companies that may be on our radar, what we are interested in to drive our price. But, we feel really good about the overall portfolio that we have. And in terms of the available market and growth opportunities for what we already have, we feel really good. We will continuously look at adjacencies in order to continue to extend our lead, but nothing stands out as a weakness or gap in our portfolio.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Keith, your line is open.","Keith Bachman","Hi. Many thanks. Shantanu, I wanted to try this for you. Going back to the Marketing Cloud and you commented in your formal remarks the Experience Cloud that you expect FY17 to be better than 20% organic bookings growth. And yet, I\u2019m trying to understand how to reconcile, because there was clearly some degradation in the Q4 guidance. And I understand it\u2019s a tough comp where you\u2019re talking about 17%, but that still includes TubeMogul, which is mostly in the quarter. And so, as we think about the business, as you look out beyond this quarter, can the Experience Cloud grow on an organic basis more -- is 20% the message that we should be thinking about as we look at next fiscal year for the growth of the Experience Cloud?","Shantanu Narayen","I think those are two separate issues. And we want to make sure, Keith that we separate the two separate issues. Because when we started the second half of the year and provided targets for the remainder of the year for the Digital Marketing revenue segment, even at that point, we had talked about while we were targeting 25% which is now 24%, we expected sequentially Q3 to be higher from a year-over-year growth perspective than Q4. So, there is nothing that you should read into the 17% because that\u2019s something that we had outlined at the beginning of the second half of the year. So, I wanted to make sure we clarified that.","Mark Garrett","And the reason Keith that we had a 25% target as opposed to what used to be a 20% target for revenue was specifically because of Tube. So, that was factored in both the quarter and the year.","Shantanu Narayen","Correct. And as it relates to the long-term growth prospects, I think we\u2019ve outlined how large this opportunity is. We\u2019re not proving FY18 targets right now. But nothing has changed, as it relates to the substantial opportunity that exists for the offerings that we have as people embark on digital transformation.","Keith Bachman","Okay. Will you provide some specific context associated with the upcoming Analyst Event?","Mark Garrett","At Analyst Day, yes, we will provide much more context.","Keith Bachman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Alex, your line is open.","Alex Zukin","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So, maybe the first question on Marketing Cloud specifically. Were there any changes to sales teams or sales leadership or do you anticipate making them on the digital marketing side? And then, Shantanu, maybe a big picture question along the same lines, not necessarily what a gap you have in the marketing portfolio. But if you stack rank your ability to weigh [ph] your success in continued market leadership in B2C marketing into B2B or do you need a customer record or a customer dataset to be able to do that and\/or do you look at maybe going down market as easier pathway to continued growth? So, just big picture and a small -- more specific account there?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, I think on the first question, I mean, there\u2019s nothing that we are outlining except continued focus on execution with respect to sales execution. So, that one is an easy one.","As it relates to the stack ranking, I think you are right in saying that B2C clearly represented the first beachhead in terms of people who are embarking on digital transformation. However, there are a number of customers who are already in the B2B space who are adopting our solutions because they are going through absolutely the same scenarios and they have been using our solutions in order to deliver digital transformation whether it\u2019s B2B or B2C. So while the first beachhead was B2C, we have already made traction and continue to see opportunity in B2B.","As it relates to your question around going down market and the existence of a customer record, I think the big differentiation in our particular product is not about the customer record as much as it\u2019s the ability to in real time deliver the customer experience. And I think over time, the existence of what\u2019s on disc as a customer record is far less important than what is in memory in terms of being able to deliver the digital experience.","So, I think the game is completely changing to an in-memory how do you action based on all the data that you have, the behavior, the demographics rather than an existence or a flat file or a record associated with it. And that\u2019s really what we are focused on. We talk about it as the last millisecond in the Experience Cloud. And big picture, I think that\u2019s where we will continue to across all digital touchpoints where a customer engages with an enterprise, ensure that we deliver the best possible customer experience.","And given that was the last question, in close, we are absolutely proud of the strong financial results we reported in Q3. And I think you\u2019re clearly seeing the leverage that exists in our business model. We remain excited about the growth opportunities, clear the strategy, whether it\u2019s empowering people to bring their creativity to life or enabling businesses to transform, continuous to resonate with customers from individuals to the larger enterprises.","We have a strong portfolio of products. And this represents multiple multi-year growth opportunities. And we continue to be one of the only companies that\u2019s delivering stellar top-line and bottom-line financial results.","We hope you are going to join us at MAX because we are going to showcase tremendous innovation and we will provide update at our Analyst Meeting in conjunction with MAX.","With that, thank you for joining us today.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call.

Fiscal 2019 was a phenomenal year for Adobe as we exceeded $11 billion in revenue, a significant milestone for the company. Our record revenue and EPS performance in 2019 makes us one of the largest, most diversified, and profitable software companies in the world. Total Adobe revenue was $11.17 billion in FY 2019, which represents 24% annual growth.","GAAP earnings per share in FY 2019 was $6, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $7.87. We closed the year with another record quarter, delivering Q4 revenue of $2.99 billion, representing 21% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.74, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.29.","Our strategy to unleash creativity for all, accelerate document productivity and power digital businesses is significantly expanding our customer universe, from students to business communicators to creative professionals to the world\u2019s largest multinational corporations. Ground-breaking innovation in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud is accelerating our opportunity and momentum.","Creative Cloud empowers all voices from the most demanding professional to next gen creators; enables the cutting edge of creativity across all media types; makes the creative process more productive and collaborative; and delivers Adobe magic with Sensei. We continue to invest in multiple new growth drivers, which has expanded the total addressable market for Creative Cloud to approximately $31 billion by 2022.","Innovation is at the heart of Creative Cloud\u2019s growth. This year at MAX, we announced the next generation of Creative Cloud, with goals of deepening customer engagement, continuing to attract new customers, and investing in adjacent opportunities to fuel future growth. ","Key announcements at MAX included: Delivering additional value to existing subscribers through feature enhancements to our flagship creative tools, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Premiere Pro, Illustrator and InDesign, as well as a complete redesign of our Creative Cloud desktop app; enabling collaboration via multi-surface systems with the launch of Photoshop on iPad, Fresco on Windows, and a preview of Illustrator on iPad; extending category leadership with new innovations in Adobe XD, including live co-editing and fully integrated Creative Cloud Libraries; launching new products such as Adobe Aero, the industry\u2019s first tool that allows designers to build and share AR experiences; expanding our mobile offering with the introduction of Photoshop Camera, a consumer app that will bring Photoshop technology directly to the moment of capture; and Delivering Adobe magic to enable creatives to work faster and smarter than ever before with new Adobe Sensei-powered features.","Adobe\u2019s heritage is built on providing trusted creative solutions, and we have a responsibility to play a role in addressing content authenticity.","At MAX, we announced an initiative in partnership with The New York Times Company and Twitter to develop an industry standard for digital content attribution, and we\u2019re inviting other companies to join to create a long-term shared solution.","With Document Cloud, Adobe is enabling the paper-to-digital transformation that is underway at organizations and enterprises around the world. With trillions of PDFs created every year and billions of people viewing PDF documents, we\u2019ve expanded our ambitions in this space, and estimate the total addressable market for Document Cloud will grow to approximately $13 billion by 2022.","Our Document Cloud strategy is to enable all common document actions, what we call Acrobat verbs, including editing, sharing, scanning and signing to be frictionless across mobile and web by leveraging the ubiquitous PDF format. We make this possible through desktop and mobile applications, single-click web functionality in browsers, and with a rich set of APIs that can be embedded in third-party applications.","Our Document Cloud ecosystem continues to grow. At BoxWorks, we introduced a new Acrobat web experience, which includes capabilities to modify, organize, sign and collaborate on PDFs directly within Box. At Microsoft Ignite, we announced new advancements in Adobe Sign to simplify the e-signature process, and we deepened integrations between Adobe Sign and Microsoft Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure.","In Q4, we drove strong revenue growth across both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Digital Media revenue was $2.08 billion. Net new Digital Media ARR was a record $539 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q4 grew to $8.40 billion. Global interest and subscription adoption were strong throughout the quarter and accelerated after Adobe MAX. Demand for mobile offerings and overall web traffic continued to grow.","We are attracting new customers, with over 50% of our cumulative subscribers being new to our Creative Cloud franchise. With 23 million students having access to Adobe Spark, we\u2019re spearheading the development of critical creative skills for the next generation. Document Cloud growth is being driven by new customer acquisition, migration from Acrobat perpetual licenses to subscriptions, and the monetization of an ever-increasing universe of Document Cloud mobile app users. Digital Media enterprise adoption continues to expand with outstanding seasonal Q4 performance.","Finally, we drove record demand for subscriptions during the last week of the quarter, culminating in our biggest ever Black Friday on Adobe.com. In the experience economy, every business must be a digital business and Adobe Experience Cloud is the industry leader for powering digital businesses. The ever-increasing demand for data and insights, content and personalization, customer journey management, commerce and advertising is expanding our total addressable market for Experience Cloud to $84 billion by 2022.","We\u2019re leveraging our relationships with Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Digital Officers to drive Customer Experience Management (NYSEMKT:CXM) across the enterprise. With Adobe Experience Platform we are becoming mission critical to the Chief Information Officer. We\u2019ve extended our offerings and go-to-market across both B2B and B2C and are expanding our footprint in the mid-market segment.","We\u2019re rapidly evolving our CXM product strategy to deliver generational technology platforms, launch innovative new services and introduce enhancements to our market-leading applications.

With real-time customer profiles, continuous intelligence, and an open and extensible architecture, Adobe Experience Platform makes delivering personalized customer experiences at scale a reality.","At Adobe, we\u2019ve leveraged our highly successful data-driven operating model, or DDOM, into a transformation playbook for our customers. We\u2019re helping enterprises rearchitect their technology, people and processes to drive business growth. We have a unique and valuable perspective as a company that has used its own technology to transform its business.","Our leadership in Customer Experience Management is reflected in the industry recognition we received in Q4, including being named the top leader in Forrester\u2019s Digital Intelligence Platforms Wave report, achieving the best scores across both \u2018Ability to Execute\u2019 and \u2018Completeness of Vision.\u2019 Adobe was named a leader by Gartner and Forrester in the categories of Enterprise Marketing Software Suites, Digital Asset Management and CRM Lead Management.","If you\u2019ve watched TV, listened to the radio or read the news this past week, you could not have avoided references to Adobe\u2019s Holiday Shopping predictions report, which leverages Adobe Sensei to identify retail trends and insights from trillions of data points flowing through Adobe Analytics and Adobe Commerce Cloud. Adobe\u2019s data showed that Cyber Monday reached a record $9.4 billion in online sales, and we predict online holiday spending will surpass $140 billion this year.","Key Digital Experience transactions in the quarter included Goldman Sachs, Marriott, McDonald\u2019s, and Qualcomm. Interest in the Adobe Experience Platform and our new Real-Time Customer Data Platform is strong and we successfully closed business across key verticals, including financial services, manufacturing, media and entertainment, retail, telecommunications, and travel and hospitality. Key wins included 3M, Coca-Cola, Synopsys, Tommy Bahama, and Verizon. As a result of the strong Q4, we exceeded 20% subscription bookings growth during FY 2019. ","Our performance in FY 2019 was driven by the significant contributions of our global employees. They are Adobe\u2019s greatest asset and we pride ourselves on our progressive and inclusive employee policies. This year, we reaffirmed global pay parity across our workforce, and in September, we became the first company to announce our commitment to opportunity parity, which looks at fairness in internal promotions and horizontal movement.","We are proud to once again be included on Fortune\u2019s list of the \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d and one of the \u201cBest Employers for New Grads\u201d by Forbes. We\u2019re pleased to have been recognized by Newsweek as one of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Most Responsible Companies\u201d and were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. We were honored to receive the Hope Award from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children for our ongoing work to further their mission of keeping every child safe.","Adobe\u2019s vision, our compelling strategy, our large and loyal customer base, and our relentless focus on these opportunities position us well for the next decade of growth. Adobe is the clear frontrunner in the categories we serve: creativity, digital documents, and customer experience management. Our best days remain ahead of us and we look forward to a phenomenal 2020. John?","John Murphy","Thanks, Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2019 results. Starting with our annual results, in FY 2019 Adobe achieved record revenue of $11.17 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $6, and non-GAAP EPS was $7.87. This performance is the result of strong execution against our expanding strategy resulting in noteworthy achievements, including: Digital Media segment revenue of $7.71 billion, representing 22% year-over-year growth; creative revenue of $6.48 billion, representing 21% year-over-year growth; Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $1.22 billion, representing 25% year-over-year growth; exiting the year with $8.4 billion of Digital Media ARR, an annual increase of $1.69 billion; Digital Experience segment revenue of $3.21 billion, representing 31% year-over-year growth; Digital Experience subscription revenue of $2.67 billion, representing 37% year-over-year growth; Growing Digital Experience subscription bookings by greater than 20%; Generating $4.42 billion in operating cash flow during the year; Growing Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO, to approximately $9.82 billion; and returning $2.7 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program.","In the fourth quarter of FY 2019, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.99 billion, which represents 21% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.74 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.29. Business and financial highlights in Q4 included: Digital Media revenue of $2.08 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth; net new Digital Media ARR of $539 million; Digital Experience revenue of $859 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth; record cash flow from operations of $1.38 billion; increasing RPO by more than $1 billion; and repurchasing 2.8 million shares of our stock during the quarter.","In our Digital Media segment, we achieved record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth in Q4. The addition of $539 million net new Digital Media ARR grew the total to $8.40 billion. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 20% year-over-year and we increased Creative ARR by $445 million in Q4. Driving this performance was continued strength with acquisition, upsell and retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, as well as the adoption of Creative Cloud services.","Key Q4 Creative growth drivers included: new user growth, fueled by demand generation initiatives including targeted campaigns and promotions, an increase in mobile app users, and year-end seasonal strength; end of November strength coming from interest driven by the recent Adobe MAX conference and follow-on targeted campaigns that helped drive record performance during the last week of the quarter; continued strength with single app adoption, particularly with our imaging and video offerings; a strong finish to the year in the enterprise with renewals, upsell and enterprise services adoption; continued momentum with creative services including Adobe Stock, where revenue again grew greater than 30% year-over-year; and Improvements in retention across all our offerings.","Adobe Document Cloud revenue growth accelerated once again in Q4. We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $339 million, which represents 31% year-over-year growth, and we added $94 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. Document Cloud performance during Q4 and the year was driven by: Acrobat subscription demand across all customer segments; The conversion of free mobile app users to paid subscriptions for services such as Create PDF Online; Document Cloud services adoption, including Adobe Sign revenue, which grew greater than 25% year-over-year in Q4; and Year-end strength in perpetual and OEM licensing.","In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record quarterly revenue of $859 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth in Q4. Subscription revenue for the quarter was $726 million, growing 31% year-over-year. With strong Q4 bookings, we achieved greater than 20% subscription bookings growth for the year. For the year, we achieved $3.21 billion of Digital Experience revenue, which represents 31% year-over-year growth.","Key Q4 highlights include: Strong year-over-year growth in our Content & Commerce solutions, led by Adobe Experience Manager and success with cross-selling and up-selling Magento; Adoption of Adobe Experience Platform, Audience Manager and Real-Time CDP in our Data & Insights solutions; and momentum in our Marketo business, including in the mid-market segment, which helped fuel growth in our Customer Journey Management solutions.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $5.8 million. We had $11.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY 2019, versus $10.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY 2019; thus, the net sequential currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $5 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $39.6 million. The $11.6 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY 2019 versus the $30.5 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY 2018 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $58.5 million.","We experienced strong global demand, but FX reduced reported year-over-year revenue growth, particularly in EMEA. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 11% on both a GAAP basis and a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 49 days in the year-ago quarter, and 44 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation or \u201cRPO\u201d was $9.82 billion exiting Q4, which compares to $8.77 billion exiting Q3.","Normal seasonality and strong year-end performance contributed to the more than $1 billion increase in RPO during Q4. Deferred revenue exiting Q4 was $3.50 billion. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $4.18 billion, and cash flow from operations was $1.38 billion in the quarter. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2.8 million shares at a cost of $771 million.","During fiscal 2019, we repurchased approximately 9.9 million shares, returning $2.7 billion of cash to stockholders. We currently have $5.1 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018, which goes through 2021. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year and revalue ARR at year-end for current currency rates. FX rate changes between December of 2018 and this year have resulted in a $66 million decrease in Digital Media ARR. This decreases our FY 2020 beginning Digital Media ARR balance to $8.33 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor data sheet, and ARR results will be measured against this amount during FY 2020.","We are providing the following fiscal year 2020 targets: Total Adobe revenue of approximately $13.15 billion; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.55 billion; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 16%; Digital Experience subscription revenue year-over-year growth of approximately 18%; Digital Experience subscription bookings year-over-year growth of greater than 20%; tax rate of approximately 11% on a GAAP basis and non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 486 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $7.40; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $9.75.","For Q1 FY 2020 we are targeting: Revenue of approximately $3.04 billion; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $360 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 15%; net non-operating expense of approximately $20 million; tax rate of approximately 5% on a GAAP basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 489 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.76; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.23.","We expect Digital Media net new ARR in FY 2020 to grow sequentially from Q1 to Q2, dip in Q3 and have a strong seasonal finish in Q4. As a reminder, Q1 FY 2019 benefitted from a positive one-time $20 million ARR adjustment due to the adoption of ASC 606. We anticipate total Adobe revenue to grow by approximately 17% year-over-year in the first half of FY 2020, followed by approximately 18% year-over-year growth in the second half of the year.","In summary, we finished fiscal 2019 strong with record performance in Q4. Based on our category leadership and strong momentum exiting 2019, we remain bullish about fiscal 2020 and beyond.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, John.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.","Brent Thill","Hi, good afternoon. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could take a deeper dive in the continued strength in Digital Media ARR, including the better-than-expected Q1 guide, what's driving this continued outperformance on your side?","Shantanu Narayen","Happy to, Brent. I mean, I think at the financial analyst meeting, we tried to outline all of the growth drivers that we have in that business. And as you remember, even at the FA meeting, we actually updated targets as a result of this trend that we were seeing in the quarter. And clearly that strength continued. So, a couple of things that come to mind. New customer acquisition just continues to be strong across all geographies. I think the new product introductions that we were doing. Strength in Acrobat across both our offerings was clearly a strength.","We saw a very strong seasonal enterprise at the end of the quarter. The stock business just continues to do well. When you have a $539 million quarter, it's hard to point to one thing, Brent. And I think that, again, we've talked a lot about our DDOM. I'll also highlight the campaigns that we run really targeted personalized campaigns, tapping into was clearly a tremendous online season was also another reason for the continued success.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Operator","And next will be Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question. And really nice quarter. I wanted to ask John a question about operating margins. You guys continue to see a really nice bounce back from the M&A impacts that you saw in \u2013 during FY 2019 into Q4. When we think about FY 2020, should we continue to see that continued operating margin leverage? Is there more sort of accounting impact that's coming out, that will push margins higher? Number one. And number two, for Q1, the EPS guide seems to imply operating margins down from Q4 to Q1. And absent the acquisition, we tend not to see that historically. So, what would lead sort of Q1 operating margins to be lower versus the Q4 levels?","John Murphy","Yes, sure. Thanks, Keith. Well, when we think about FY 2020, our full year guide shows that FY 2020 margins do expand year-over-year. And so, as we think about kind of the first half, second half, we'd expect that margins would continue to show greater than 40% each quarter, but have larger margins in the second half like we did this past year. There's some seasonal expenses that obviously hit Q1 different from others in last year, of course, we had more expenses related to the acquisitions that kind of dramatized that downward, taking the operating margin in Q1 of FY 2019.","Operator","And our next question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Diana Chang","Hi. It's Diana Chang on for Kirk Materne. Thanks for taking my question. First Shantanu, maybe now that you've been running the Experience Cloud for almost a year, what are some of the bigger factors in terms of like seeing this business potentially could outperform in 2020 next year. And maybe secondly, just like when thinking about the Experience Cloud business, can you discuss like how demand varies when you think about like the different geographies. And is it fair to say that the share from like point products or platform is further ahead in the U.S.? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Well, multiple questions there. So, let me try and parse all of that. First, I would say, it's been a really good year for the Experience Cloud in terms of the product innovation, delivering the Experience Cloud, looking at experience manager and moving that to the cloud, innovative new services that we're delivering intelligent services using our AI and machine learning.","When I take a step back and look at what's happened during the year, I feel really good about the amount of innovation that's happening. And the second thing I feel really good about is the alignment across Magento, Marketo and just call it, the core DX business in terms of having a more unified and aligned go-to-market, which has not only helped our results, but it's also helped the operating expense associated with that business.","And so, we just continue to have a really differentiated offering. The need for people to engage digitally with customers is not just a U.S. phenomenon. It's a global phenomenon. And so that feels really good. And so, I mean, overall, we had a very strong Q4 as we mentioned the Adobe Experience Platform adoption among various verticals. It's such a unique and differentiated product that exists in the marketplace. We're the only company at scale that has the ability to create this unified profile.","So overall, I feel really good on that business. We also have tremendous opportunities in 2020. We just continue to scale that business to be delivering it, not just across geographies and the mid-market segment. We talked about how creating an aligned mid-market-focused segment. We saw a rebound as it related to Marketo. Magento continues to do well. And I know, typically, people ask me, what's the update on the hiring front. There's good news that we will hopefully be able to share with you in the first week of January. But it feels good. We made a lot of progress in that business. Opportunity is great, and we will continue to drive innovation.","Diana Chang","Thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","And moving on to Jennifer Lowe with UBS.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. I think this is a question for John. I just wanted to drill into the comment you made that the revenue growth in the first half of the year would be 17% versus 18% in the back half, but that's a pretty bold statement to make with six months before you're actually in that 18% growth. So, is that purely a function of the expectation that the strength that you're seeing in Digital Experience booking starts to convert to revenue, and you see that part of the business pick up a bit? Or are there other factors at play that we should be thoughtful about as we think of the shape of the year? Thanks.","John Murphy","Yes. I mean, I think what we wanted to try to do because we didn't provide any Q1 guidance when we're at MAX on [our payday]. And so, what we wanted to do was to provide color of how you could think about modeling the full year. And obviously, with the full year guide, you obviously with the total year growth is. But we do expect, obviously, the bookings that we've achieved in FY 2019 to convert into revenue in 2020 and obviously the first half bookings to begin to convert into revenue in the second half. So, the momentum that we're seeing coming out of Q4 is really what we're trying to reflect on when that converts.","Shantanu Narayen","Maybe just to add a few more color, Jennifer, I mean, I think when we at the FA meeting, we were really trying to give annual guidance, and what we were trying to do is just give you a little bit of color. And to add to what John said, as you think about the Q4 to Q1 transition, what typically happens in Q4 in the Digital Experience business is, you get a bunch of really good professional services billing as people are preparing our products to get ready for the holiday season, you see a little bit of a rush on the advertising cloud associated with that. There was a little bit of strength also.","Acrobat had strength across the board, but there was some additional strength as it related to perpetual and OEM licensing. And so, I think what we were just trying to do is provide you a little bit of color as it related to how you would, in your models, look at both revenue as well as EPS, as well as Digital Media ARR for the rest of the year. So, that was our goal.","Jennifer Lowe","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question come from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Shantanu, can you remind us what is the monetization model for some of the mobile device apps, specifically thinking about now that Photoshop on iPad has been out there for a while. And at MAX, you talked through Illustrator for iPad. How do you monetize that? And how much of a needle mover can something like Illustrator be to either fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2021.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Sterling, there are multiple ways in which we monetize our mobile. The first is this multi-system approach that we've taken, maybe using a product like Lightroom, for example. I mean, it's clear when people have images, they want to manage their images across multiple devices. And so, we take a system approach towards that pricing, but it changes quite dramatically, what you could see in terms of the engagement and retention associated with it. So, first in terms of value provided, that's quite significant.","The second thing is, we actually have mobile-only offerings as well. And so, you could have a mobile-only offering, whether it's Photoshop Express, whether it's what we do with our Photoshop on iPad. And so, we have one price for \u2013 across multiple devices, and where we have one price for mobile-only offering. And the mobile-only offering, I think in the past, we've alluded to the number of ID\u2019s that are being created. And that's also becoming a really nice revenue stream for us and growing.","And the third thing I would say is, what we've done a really good job on the Acrobat side is where you have Reader and people have one-time usage, where they're trying to do things with respect to PDF. That's also become a fairly significant monetization model. So, there are multiple monetization models that's attracting new customers, different price points, different segments. And I think it just enables our positioning as the one-stop shop to be very valid and very relevant for all of these customers. So, now long term, we continue to be excited and bullish about the growth there.","Sterling Auty","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, it's been just over a year when you introduced the phrase, retention is the new growth. And I was wondering how you would rank that among the various sources of growth in fiscal 2019, particularly given the multiple investments you've been making internally and in people to drive retention. And related to that, picking up on a theme from the latest MAX, might it be possible to think of an additional growth driver that we could call perhaps frictionless is the new growth. In other words, picking up on content-as-a-service, PDF services, DX integrations and the frictionless scheme that you talked about at MAX as an additional driver over many years?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Jay, I think both of those continue to be really important strategic objectives for the company as it relates to retention as the book of business gets larger and larger, both in terms of ensuring that they're getting value for the products, as well as from an upsell perspective and being able to upsell them. And you'd be amazed how productive the retention team has been in terms of really understanding what's the right offer, what's the right way to continue to make sure that they get value out of it. The incredible work that's being done even as it relates to payment methods and just making sure that, that is a way to both attract and retain new customers to the platform.","So, retention is a very big area of focus, and I continue to believe that it is an area of growth within the enterprise with named user deployment, what we are doing associated with making it really easy for people to adopt our technology. So that, again, is a way in which we are increasing both the ARPU, as well as the number of users in the enterprise. And so, real good focus with some significant results.","On the frictionless, I think you clearly see that customers, when they do a search, and if they want to do a search for create PDF, for example, they want that to be immediately fulfilled and get instant gratification. And so, the reason and the thesis behind frictionless is when people are doing something, how can we, within one or two clicks, enable them to do it as well as, at that point, ensure that it's a monetization opportunity for us.","And so, I think that'll continue to be both in the document space, as well as in the creative space as we have done with Spark, where you do a Google search and you want to create a flyer, and we want to be able to fulfill that very easily. So, I think it's important and I think expansion opportunity for us on frictionless. So, we're doing well in both cases, and it will continue to be an area of focus.","I know you didn't ask it, but you are aware that even on the API side, making sure that all of our stuff is available as APIs is another way to just extend this reach through the partner ecosystem as well.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks, Shantanu.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Bank of America.","Kash Rangan","Hi, happy holidays team Adobe. Thanks for the wonderful gift. Shantanu, I had a question. We started this fiscal year with expectations for 25% bookings in Digital Experience, and we had a bit of a reset in Q4. Are we at the bottom of the curve and its execution starting to improve? Or execution is back up to the point that you had targeted earlier and that you're just playing a little bit conservative with respect to revenue growth outcome for fiscal 2020? And then once we get through a couple more quarters, you'd be in a position to re-examine the target for Digital Experience. That's it. Congratulations again.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Kash, and happy holidays to you as well. I mean, I would say, we were really pleased with the momentum that we saw for the business in Q4. As I said earlier, I'm also really pleased with the amount of innovation that the product team has been able to do with all of the new delivery. And the opportunity, as we\u2019ve identified north of $80 billion addressable opportunity in 2022, just continues to be the area of focus for us. And so, we will continue to execute. I'm not giving you different targets from the one that John just gave, but we're not opportunity constraint in that particular business.","Kash Rangan","Wonderful. Congrats.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","And moving on to Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.","Yao Tsung Chu","Hi, everyone. This is Yao Tsung Chu on for Brad Zelnick. Congrats on another solid quarter. I want to take a question in slightly different route. As you're going into more mobile-centric offerings with stuff like Photoshop for iPad and Photoshop Camera, you run into a lot more mobile native or next-generation competition, whether it's Instagram or even some new apps like VSCO, it's fundamentally a very different landscape. Can you speak to the philosophy on growth in the mobile realm, how you approach user acquisition, retention and primarily how you see Adobe differentiating for what is a very different use case on a different screen?","John Murphy","It's no different in many ways from what we have done on the desktop. I mean, we have the world's best product teams and technologies in that space. And we actually have. I mean, when you see what we've done with Acrobat on PDF on the mobile. What we have done with Photoshop Express, tens of millions of users, the fact that we have hundreds of millions of mobile IDs, I think you think about the brand that Adobe has, you think about the depth of technology that we have in those spaces, I'd encourage you to try out a product like Fresco, which whether it's for oil paint, whether it's for water colors, I mean, there's nothing like that on the market with respect to the amount of precision and detail that we provide in that space.","And so, we just have to continue to focus on innovating, but given our brand, given the tremendous funnel of traffic that we see to adobe.com, and as we keep pointing out the data-driven operating model that we have to be able to convert it, I feel very good about what we are doing in the mobile arena as well.","Yao Tsung Chu","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Thanks. Shantanu, I'm just wondering, if you look at the Acrobat business adopting the cloud piece, and you sort of compare with the transition from perpetual installed base to subscription installed base. Where are we? Are we in the third inning? Fifth inning? Seventh inning? Any characterization you can give us around where that is. That seems like it's been a pretty strong driver. Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Walter, the PDF business just continues to do really well. We're attracting new customers to the platform. Sign as a business is doing really well. The new services, the mobile funnel continues to do well. As you know, we've feathered that business so that we continue to have a perpetual offering and an OEM licensing offering, those continue to do well.","I mean, the reality is that automating inefficient paper-based processes and just the whole collaboration, and sharing and editing of documents is a massive opportunity. And PDF has become the lingua franca for how things happen on the Internet and the PDF brand, I mean, going back to the earlier question. The team has done an incredible job of innovating in that particular space, it's really early. As a cricket fan, we don't have three innings in cricket, but it's still very early as it relates to where we are in that space.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tom Roderick with Stifel.","Tom Roderick","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I know there's been a couple of questions on Experience Cloud already, but Shantanu, I wanted to just ask you specifically as you spend some time going back through the Marketo pipeline. And last quarter, there was a discussion about mid-market and perhaps having focused more exclusively on the high-end of the market. Can you just kind of go back and talk a little bit more about how you're seeing that mid-market opportunity for Marketo? How you want to deploy resources and how you think about the mix between mid-market and enterprise for that side of the business? It sounds like you had a great fourth quarter that bounced back nicely. So, would love to hear what you did and what you want to do going forward in go to market. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Great, Tom. And I think the reason why we believe in the mid-market opportunity across content management across commerce, across what we are doing with the Marketo business and taking leads all the way to making them revenue for a company is that having an easy-to-use self-serve product serves not just the mid-market customer well, but it also serves the enterprise customer well. And I think tongue-in-cheek I have always said, every business starts at a $0 billion business. And so, you want to make sure that you get a huge base of customers who are growing early. And so, that's the reason for the importance of the business.","I think over the last few quarters, the demand generation team has done such a good job. A lot of the mid-market demand generation is actually created through marketing activities and then it's actually \u2013 it has a very different touch perspective. And so, having that, it's actually a more efficient process for us to do. And by investing a little bit more in demand generation in the last few quarters, we've seen that bounce back well.","The product has always been good, the best product in the market. And I think just both inspecting that business and making sure that we invest appropriately and have the right leadership, all of that's really helped with that particular space. Having a depth of offering also, given what we have with experience manager and given what we have with Magento for an end-to-end solution, also really helps in that base. So, we're excited about it.","Tom Roderick","Outstanding. Congratulations. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Mark for Pat. Thank you so much for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about customer data platform, and maybe what are some customer feedback? And what's your focus for next year?","Shantanu Narayen","I'm not sure I heard the question. Could you just repeat the question, please?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about customer data platform, CDP, and what are some customer feedback from there?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, I mean, as part of our prepared remarks, we talked about the fact that the Adobe Experience Platform is really the only scalable platform that allows people to have this unified profile. As people are thinking about what they have to do, they have to deal with both known users and unknown users. And I think the combination of what we had with audience manager and the real-time CDP aspects of how we differentiate our solution makes it unique. And so, every business has to think about its core segmentation. Every business has to think about what's the way in which they are creating this unified profile. And so, we're excited about our offering in that space. That's a clear leader.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from James Rutherford with Stephens.","James Rutherford","Hi, thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Just as a follow-up to Tom's question earlier, it sounds like you're having nice success with the mid-market realignment on Marketo and Magento, and that's great to see. I was just curious what your ambitions are to bring some of the other core Adobe DX solutions like AEM, Campaign, Audience Manager and others down into the mid-market as well. And what it might require in terms of changes to product or packaging to really make a big debt in that particular size of the market? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","I'll touch on one, maybe in a little bit of detail, which is the Adobe Experience Manager. We have, over the last year, really innovated. We have an offering that's a completely cloud-based offering that enables you to do it. You can do headless content management. It's so far ahead of the competition. So, I think that hopefully gives you a glimpse into the fact that we do believe it's an opportunity as we move to the cloud and make these all SaaS-based services, I think making that self-help.","In the content management space, in particular, as people are creating these micro sites, and they want to get it up and running quickly, but they want to use the same publishing paradigm that they use for their larger sites. That's another reason, but the new AEM product that we have that's cloud-based. The number of customers who've been able to get up and running really quickly, I think, shows the kind of innovation.","Take Adobe itself, for example, as we move our cloud-based AEM implementation, it really adds significant value. And as I said earlier, it's not just about the mid-market, that same technology actually translates well into enterprises seeing value from our products sooner rather than later.","Mike Saviage","Justin, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","And that question will come from Ken Wong with Guggenheim Securities.","Ken Wong","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. This question is for you, John. I know you guys don't discuss RPO much, but the uptick in Q4 was really strong. Maybe if you can give us a little insight into what drove that? And then to the extent that you could shed a little color on maybe what seasonality of RPO might look like next year, that would be great?","John Murphy","Yes, sure. The performance of RPO, and as we go forward, you'll start to get the year-over-year compare in FY 2020, it's following along with revenue growth. And it's \u2013 essentially, when we look at before, deferred and unbilled that also as an indicator of the health of the business going forward. Now, we would suggest you look at the RPO as an indicator of what to expect in terms of it growing along with revenue. That has normal seasonality that we typically have seen across each of the quarters as well, so there's nothing unique about that.","Shantanu Narayen","And given that was the last question, what's exciting to us was at our Analyst Day at MAX, we shared the strategy on the three large opportunities that we had ahead of us; unleashing creativity, accelerating document productivity and powering digital businesses and how it represented a TAM of approximately $128 billion in 2022. It's nice to be the leader in those categories and continue to drive product innovation, as well as GTM alignment and execution, so that we can continue on this growth agenda that we have as a company, but at the same time, we also continue to be focused on increasing cash flow, as well as delivering great value to our shareholders. ","Clearly, pleased with our fiscal performance in Q4. FY 2020 should be another record year with strong profitability and cash flow. And I'm really excited about the progress that we made across all three clouds on product, GTM, as well as organizational alignment, and we look forward to sharing that progress with you over the course of next year.","I wanted to wish you all happy holidays. Thank you for joining us today.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference. We do thank you for your participation.

I would like to welcome you to Adobe Systems\u2019 First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon. And thank you for, joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen and Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO. In the call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2017 financial results.","By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release, which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We\u2019ve also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, financial targets and an updated investor datasheet on adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links.","Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, March 16, 2017, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the forward-looking statements disclosure in the earnings press release we issued today, as well as Adobe\u2019s SEC filings.","During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is available in our earnings release, and in our updated investor datasheet, on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations Web site. Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live in Adobe Connect, and is also being recorded for playback purposes.

The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks Mike and good afternoon. Adobe had an outstanding first quarter with record revenue of $1.68 billion and record profit, GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.94. We continue to execute well against our strategy, and are driving momentum across our entire business. Digital transformation has created a tailwind for Adobe among a diverse spectrum of customers in a broad number of industries, from students, to designers, to the public sector, and the world\u2019s largest brands.","Once the domain solely of professionals, today everyone is a creator; from the teenager doing a school photography project; to the small business owner, prototyping her Web site to the film-maker; working on his first documentary; and designers become a critical element in the fabric of our lives. Design is the starting point for every connection we make, and great design requires innovative technology.","At the same time, massive amounts of data, the proliferation of devices and skyrocketing customer expectations, are forcing enterprises to completely rethink their business strategies. To forge stronger customer connections that lead to brand loyalty and growth, forward-looking enterprises are reimagining the experience they provide to their customers. At Adobe, we\u2019ve have always known that a great customer experience is the differentiator that separates market leaders from the pack.","At the center of every great experience are customer intelligence and amazing design, and these are Adobe\u2019s core competencies. Our mission to help our customers design and deliver great experiences has never been more relevant as is reflected in our outstanding Q1 results.","In Digital Media, we continue to be the undisputed leader in helping customers inject creativity into their jobs, schoolwork and their daily lives. We achieved a record $1.14 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q1 and exited the quarter with over $4.25 billion of Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q1 was $265 million, and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud business.","Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creatives the world over and we continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments, and adding value through new services. In Q1, Creative Cloud ARR growth was driven by strong performance in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud teams offering and international growth, as well as strong retention of existing subscribers. This year, two of Adobe\u2019s iconic creative apps are celebrating anniversaries. In March, Adobe Illustrator, the industry-standard vector graphics app that lets you create logos, typography, and complex illustrations for print, web, video, and mobile, celebrated its 30th anniversary. 30 years of Illustrator projects are visible everywhere across the world, from billboards on U.S. highways to magazine covers in Tokyo. More than 180 million graphics are created monthly with Illustrator.","Earlier this week, we celebrated Premiere Pro\u2019s 25th anniversary. Premiere Pro is the world\u2019s leading video production solution, and continues to grow its footprint across every video segment. Premiere Pro was the official editing tool of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in January. Premiere Pro\u2019s virtual reality workflows are seeing strong adoption with the majority of the films in the Virtual Reality category at Sundance having used it in their creative process.","As part of our year-long celebration, we are partnering with the Grammy-award-winning band, Imagine Dragons, which just released the music video for its newest song, Believer. Earlier this week, we announced that creatives in 27 countries will have the chance to take the raw video footage from the original video and cut their own version.","Our Adobe Stock service business continues to accelerate. In the past year, we have grown Adobe Stock assets to more than 60 million and in January, we announced a partnership with 500px, a global online photography community, which expands Adobe Stock\u2019s Premium collection. The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud enables businesses to reinvent inefficient paper-based processes. In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $196 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $493 million.","Acrobat units across Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud combined, again grew double-digits year-over-year. This achievement was driven by new customer acquisition with our subscription model and the funnel of users created by the broad use of PDF and the proliferation of Adobe Reader across mobile devices.","In February, in conjunction with the Cloud Signature Consortium, we unveiled the world\u2019s first open cloud-based digital signature standard, available in any browser and on any device. We announced new functionality in Adobe Sign that enables users to create end-to-end business workflows, such as advanced document routing, online collaboration and Microsoft SharePoint integration. Adobe Sign now includes mobile tools, powered by Adobe Sensei, for scanning, reading, routing and signing documents.","Deep intelligence fueled by trillions of data transactions are the foundation of our Digital Marketing business. We drove a record $477 million in Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue in Q1, which was 26% year-over-year revenue growth. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to lead the category and be the most comprehensive offering for global brands, government agencies and institutions that need to deliver personal, consistent and relevant experiences to their audiences everywhere and every time they connect with them.","Adobe Marketing Cloud features best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaign management and media optimization. We managed more than 100 trillion data transactions on behalf of our customers over the past year across our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions.","In February, Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2017 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs research report. For the third consecutive time, Adobe was ranked the highest in completeness of vision axis among the 22 companies that were evaluated. Also in Q1, Adobe was recognized as a Leader in the Forrester Wave report on Web Content Management systems, receiving the highest score. Thanks to the completeness of our offering, our continued innovation and our growing partner network, we continue to see strong market momentum, with major customer wins this quarter at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, Mercy Health, Hutchison UK, Autotrader.com, Computer Sciences Corporation, ADT and the University of Michigan.","In December, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a leader in demand-side video advertising. We achieved strong Q1 TubeMogul revenue, and we are hard at work integrating TubeMogul with our current Adobe Media Optimizer solution.","As a combined advertising solution, we will enable Adobe\u2019s customers to optimize their video, search and display advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Next week in Las Vegas, we will conduct our largest Adobe Summit ever, with more than 12,000 attendees, including more than 1,000 of our global partners. Executives from top brands, including the NBA, National Geographic, T-Mobile and Facebook will take the stage and we\u2019ll give an update on our strategic partnership with Microsoft.","We\u2019re continuing to aggressively invest in the Adobe Cloud Platform and Adobe Sensei, our unified artificial intelligence and machine learning framework and intelligent services. Our trillions of content and data assets, along with our deep category expertise in the markets we serve, give Adobe Sensei a unique ability to help customers tackle complex experience challenges. We plan to unveil new Adobe Sensei capabilities at Adobe Summit. We will also provide an update on our adobe.io capabilities for partners, ISVs and developers, who can utilize our open platform to develop their own applications.","This level of innovation can only come from talented, creative and dedicated employees. Last month, we held our internal Tech Summit where we announced our commitment to train every one of our technical employees in artificial intelligence fundamentals. We also demonstrated the incredible work happening across the Company.","Last month, we were included on Fast Company\u2019s Most Innovative Companies list, and last week we were honored to be named to the Fortune Best Places to Work list for the 17th year. Adobe would not be the Company it is today without our rich diversity of employees, and that continued diversity is vital to our future. I would like to thank all our employees for the role they play in our continued success.","To create an exceptional customer experience, you need a potent combination of deep intelligence and amazing design. These are our unique capabilities, and our opportunity has never been greater. We have the technology leadership, partner ecosystem and customer relationships, to fundamentally reshape how individuals, brands and institutions transform themselves in the 21st century. Q1 was a great start to what we believe will be another great year for Adobe. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. In the first quarter of FY17, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.68 billion dollars, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.94. When comparing Q1 FY17 and Q1 FY16 results, it is helpful to remember that our year-ago quarter had an extra week due to Adobe\u2019s 52\/53 week fiscal year calendar. Factoring in the extra week a year ago in Q1 FY16, year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter was greater than 25%.","Highlights in Q1 included; achieving $265 million of net new Digital Media ARR; record Creative revenue of $942 million; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million; strong year-over-year growth in operating income and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 85% of Q1 revenue came from recurring sources.","In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 22% year-over-year. The addition of $265 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.25 billion exiting Q1. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $942 million, which represents 29% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $244 million during Q1 and exited the quarter with $3.76 billion of Creative ARR.","Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter. Q1 ARR performance was driven by strong subscription adoption and retention; strength with Creative Cloud for teams, particularly in Europe; and continued growth with Adobe Stock.","Creative Cloud ARPU was either steady or grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q1. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $196 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $493 million exiting Q1. Driving this growth was continued adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services, such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefitting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future.","In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. TubeMogul added $32 million of revenue in Q1, which was $13 million above our target of $19 million. Approximately $10 million of the upside was due to some of the TubeMogul revenue being recognized on a gross basis in the quarter rather than on a net basis. Excluding the extra $10 million of gross TubeMogul revenue, year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth was 24%, which was in line with our Q1 target.","As we discussed on our TubeMogul conference call in January, we intend to recognize TubeMogul revenue on a net basis. Due to some ongoing contractual commitments, there will be some small gross revenue amounts through year-end.","Mobile remains a key driver for our Marketing Cloud business; mobile data transactions grew to 56% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. Total data transactions in Q1 grew to $41.3 trillion, and in the trailing four quarters, data transactions with our Marketing Cloud solutions exceeded $100 trillion.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.8 million. We had $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17 versus $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY16; thus a net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.7 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $11.9 million. We had $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY16; thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $3.2 million.","We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q1, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 13.5% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The Q1 GAAP rate was slightly lower than targeted due to Adobe\u2019s adoption of the new accounting standard affecting taxes related to equity-based costs. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 42 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter.","Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.06 billion, up 28% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.65 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $730 million in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $238 million. We have $300 million remaining under the January 2015 authority, after which we will begin repurchases under our new $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017.","Now, I will provide our financial outlook. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.73 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $290 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q2, which represents both sequential and year-over-year growth in net new ARR achievement. We expect Digital Media Q2 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 24%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 26%.","We are targeting our Q2 share count to be approximately 499 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be approximately $15 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.66, and Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.94. In summary, Q1 was an amazing start to what we believe will be another record year for Adobe. We remain bullish about our prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks Mark. Next week, Adobe will host its annual Digital Marketing Summit in Las Vegas, with the opening day keynote on the morning of Tuesday March 21st.

And we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Kash Rangan","Mark, I hate to bring this up but, AC 606, a lot of companies are starting to give it a little thought. I\u2019m wondering if you could give us your perspective on how it would that change the revenue recognition in the Marketing Cloud and also the expense recognition? Thank you so much.","Mark Garrett","You\u2019ll see that we\u2019ve written some disclosure in our SEC filings on this. The standard, as you know, is effective for Adobe in the first quarter of 2019. So, we have quite a bit of time until it goes effective for us. We don\u2019t plan early adopt that we haven\u2019t selected a transition method yet. We\u2019re clearly evaluating the effect and the standard, and what it will do some revenue for us. We expect that revenue related to professional services in our cloud offerings, or enterprise individual and teams, would remain substantially unchanged. But again, we\u2019re in the process of evaluating that.","And as it relates to, what we would call more of an ETLA, a term-based license where software and maintenance are bundle together. Those are the arrangements that will like have some impact from the standard. But again, we have until 2019 to work through that. And as you know, we\u2019re now selling the full could solution to the enterprise. So, that\u2019s where we stand as of today. But clearly, more work to do and lots more time.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","On the Creative Cloud side, the growth of momentum continues to be strong. But can you give us a little more at least qualitative color as to the drivers of it. How much of it might be something you\u2019re doing on price and managing promotions? How much are you adding new customers, and how much of it is deeper penetration into existing customers?","Shantanu Narayen","Sterling, I\u2019ll take that question. I think we\u2019re continuing to seeing good strength across each of the groups, particularly as it relates to Q1. We saw some good SMB, small and medium business, demand that continues to do well. As you know that\u2019s the team offering, which is a higher price point offering. And especially in EMEA, we had a good quarter. I would say, Acrobat, had strong unit quarter that\u2019s reflected both in Creative Cloud, as well as in Document Cloud.","In addition to that, we continue to see good progress on retention. And so, as people migrate off the performance or the promotional pricing and get on to the full plans; and then new unit adoption, as well for the new offerings, especially the photography solution; and international continue to do well. And also, there is no question that we\u2019re combating piracy as the ability to get boxes in most countries diminishes. So, I would say across the spectrum of the different offerings. And from an ARPU point of view, as well Sterling, I think Mark mentioned that in his prepared remarks. So, that continues to be strong as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alex Zukin","Shantanu, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question for you about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the growth of front-office budgets. And maybe what change you\u2019ve observed this year, or at least start this year from, maybe the last year and the year before that. And how is that driving a change in kind of -- is that accelerating your visionary way because it seems like the shift of the digital transformation budget to the importance of the CEO level has really accelerated; so just curious to get your thoughts on that.","Shantanu Narayen","You\u2019re absolutely right. I think big picture, the conversations that we\u2019re having day-in and day-out, our enterprises recognizing that digital is transforming their agenda. And then they decompose that into what are the key things that they have to do in order to use that as an opportunity rather than a challenge. And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind. And we're part of all of those conversations.","I think if you talk to also the consulting companies, they're being brought in to aspirationally help all of these companies, rethink their business model processes and people. But top of the agenda for even the CEO and the CIO and CFO, is what are we doing with respect to delivering a better engaging customer experience? Next week at Summit, we'll talk a little bit more about how that expands on our vision or what we can do, and what people are asking to step up and do.","But I think the way it manifests itself in the business is people are saying if it's just so key to my future, I want to bet and standardize on companies that have a comprehensive platform, which is why we're always pleased to see us being rated as the number one platform that exists for this kind of technology solution.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","I heard your response Shantanu on the question around demand drivers. I'm wondering if you can just talk about ARPU, specifically as a driver in fiscal '17 and beyond. In addition to like your commentary around stock suggested that you were seeing more of an uptick there, and you have things like Sensei and so forth that are incremental to the product that you're delivering in the market. Can you help us understand how much more of a driver ARPU is versus what it\u2019s been over the last several years in this transition?","Shantanu Narayen","Walter, maybe I'll give you some color which we didn't touch on as another demand driver, which is in the enterprise. As you know, we are coming up on the anniversary of lot of the three year ETLAs. And the first time when we did the three year ETLAs Creative Cloud was relatively new. And so, what we were doing was in-effect providing them with subscription model that mirrored their, what I would call custom way of buying CS in the past. As those are all rolling off the first three year milestone, we are clearly selling them both on the CC complete solution as well as on services. So the number of people who are contracting for services right now, people have to get an exception to not contract for services. And so that clearly represents an increase in ARPU as well.","To your point, stock had a good quarter. We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory. Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding. And I think what's on your minds as well as investors is, hey, is there leverage and room for price increase as we still think we're in new customer acquisition growth, we're helping people deliver value. And so, that's really what's still driving a lot of the upside in ARR with the potential to look at optimizing further out as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Shantanu, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the success of Creative Cloud impact the adoption of the marketing suites. And I know that's been one of your goals that one could help drive the other. But have you seen any change in the ability for you being the industry standard for Creative, start to impact the Marketing Cloud side of the business? And has the messaging with customer and the receptivity started to -- have you seen any noticeable difference over the last 12 months?","Shantanu Narayen","It's a really good question Heather, and there's no question actually in our mind that where Creative Cloud was first the door opener for us to have conversations with the enterprise. There is an increased expectation from customers that the content lifecycle that we talk about, namely, the ability for them to accelerate how they deliver campaigns or how they personalize the experience that they wish to deliver across all of these different channels, is predicated on making sure that that content from, content all the way from creation through asset management and all the way out to delivery, is more seamless than it\u2019s ever been.","So, I would say three years ago, two years ago, we were talking about that as one of the benefits. I would say today every conversation with the enterprises they see that as a differentiator for us. And the expectation is that\u2019s how they will accelerate both the campaigns and how they will ensure personalize delivery. So, we\u2019re seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, it\u2019s a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Markets. Your line is now open.","Ross MacMillan","Mark, I didn\u2019t see any commentary on fiscal \u201917 guidance. I\u2019m just curious, I guess specifically, about how you are thinking on the 1 billion ARR target, given the strength in Q1 and your guide for Q2, which is certainly above our number.","Mark Garrett","Clearly, from our perspective, the business is performing exceptionally well. We had a great Q1 across all the key metrics. And to your point, we provided we think are strong Q2 targets. If you remember back, we\u2019ve guided FY \u201917 the first time at Analyst Day back in November of last year. We updated it again in December with Q4 earnings. We updated it once more in January for TubeMogul. And we just don\u2019t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance so frequently. So, we\u2019re very happy with the first quarter. We\u2019re very pleased with what we were able to do from a guidance perspective on Q2. Clearly, we\u2019ve got momentum. We just don\u2019t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance that frequently.","Ross MacMillan","And then one just quick one, just looking at Q2 guide it implies, at least I think in our model that operating margins maybe are down a little bit sequentially. And I know we have a little bit of an extra three weeks, I think from Tube. But are there any other factors for us to think about in terms of OpEx this quarter, Summit or anything else that\u2019s unusual? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Our salary increases kick-in for the Company and that has an effect on Q2 from a cost perspective. You\u2019ll see that every year. We continue to hire and invest in the Company. Again, we feel great about our performance in Q1 and our ability to drive leverage in the model going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss","On the Marketing Cloud side, you talked about and there\u2019s Gartner Magic Quadrant that came out during the quarter, and I think Forrester Wave. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment? Are any of the surround guys or any of the big guys like the Microsoft or the Oracle of the world getting more competitive in that Marketing Cloud field for you guys? And then on as a follow up, any initial gains or any initial benefits you guys are seeing from Microsoft relationship in FY17?","Shantanu Narayen","Let me take the second first, which is, you\u2019ll get an update as well as Summit. So we\u2019re hoping a lot of will be at Summit. I think you\u2019ll be pleased with how quickly we\u2019ve been able to integrate the products. And from my point of view, the benefit with the Microsoft relationship is really customer driven. Customers are asking for integration with Azure, Power BI, as well as Dynamics. And I think the team has done a great job. But next week we\u2019ll give you a little bit of an update on that.","On the first question, as it relates to the competitors, I think we have talked about. This is a $40 billion TAM. Clearly, there are other players that you are alluding to that that are also seeing this as a market opportunity. But our track record and our winning percentage record in the areas that we\u2019re strong continues to be excellent. I think we have a differentiated solution. And I think our vision of where we want to take this and how we want to continue to expand it, I think it still makes us a unique leader. But certainly, there are other players in this market as well Keith.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Question for Mark, as you know, I am particularly interested in your gross margin structure and the various components of that. You had a couple of dichotomous outcomes in Q1 expect to cost revenue the graphic you addressed. You had an usually large sequential increase in digital marketing; cost of revenue were before you\u2019ve been seeing some margin expansion there. Was that tied somehow to the TubeMogul mobile revenue upside given the way they were recording and their cost of revenues versus their gross revenue recognition? On the other hand you had a pretty material and sequential decrease in digital media COGS. Is that anomalous, or is that something that you think is sustainable? And lastly, you had a pretty significant increase in services cost of revenue, your revenues were down materially from Q4 to Q1, so lots of moving pieces in COGS. But maybe you can address those?","Mark Garrett","Yes, I mean the still biggest thing probably worth mentioning Jay, is you\u2019re exactly right. If you look at Digital Marketing this quarter that $10 million of gross revenue recognition would flow right into COGS. So you have $10 million of revenue and $10 million of COGS. If you back that $10 million of COGS out of digital marketing, the gross profit would be exactly the same as last quarter. So, there is really no change to Digital Marketing cost of service, it's been pretty consistent. And you are exactly right it's really driven by Tube.","On the Digital Media side, I think what you saw this quarter is some of the upside that you see in our revenue relative to our guidance was from a bit more perpetual product, especially on the Acrobat side. And that comes, as you know, a very, very high gross margin. So, that\u2019s why you would have seen Digital Media gross margin better this quarter.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. And the services piece?","Mark Garrett","I can't remember what your question was. It was back to\u2026","Jay Vleeschhouwer","So, services revenue were down sequentially, but you had a pretty meaningful sequential increase in services COGS?","Mark Garrett","The revenues down sequentially mainly because in Q4 it's a very difficult time for the teams to deliver services with holidays and year-end. So, typically Q1 revenue is going to be a little bit lighter on the services side, and the cost of services doesn't change that much. So, that's why you see a little bit less on the gross margin side.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Samad Samana","So, we saw that in early February, the Company pushed-out price increases in some international, or outside of the U.S., in some countries where FX is a particular headwind. I'm curious if you learned any lessons from those price increases, and whether it shows you what the appetite for customers is. Is this to accept those, and how it impacts your thought on raising prices in the U.S.?","Mark Garrett","We did push-out some price increases around the world in various markets, because of FX to stay FX neutral, if you will. And the good news there is we really did not see an impact to ARR. So, that does give us confidence that down the road we're able to tweak pricing a bit. We're not taking advantage of that yet other than FX, but that was a very good sign.","Samad Samana","Maybe just a quick follow up. Could you give us what the Marketing Cloud revenue growth would have grown year-over-year, excluding the extra week, and the revenue contribution from TubeMogul, just for an apples-to-apples compare? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","With the week, I'm going to have to get back to you. The TubeMogul gross, you just take out $10 million and instead of $26 million it would have been $24 million. But I don't have the week broken out between the different businesses. It was about $75 million, we said a year ago, but we didn't split it between businesses. I don't think it's very material for Digital Marketing, to be honest with you. It's more material on the media side, that extra week; because you think about it as recognizing revenue from subscribers, it doesn't change that much from a enterprise perspective.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Derrick Wood","Shantanu, you mentioned the Adobe Stock has $60 million assets now, and I don't really know how this compares to other offerings. But I know you guys announced partnership with [technical difficulty] a few months ago. And I guess I am just curious how impactful it is when you onboard new content into the service. So, specifically, do you think these partnerships move the needle and increase the attach rate, or getting people to subscribe to the monthly version? And would you say growth is tied to bringing more content onboard, or are you really at that full scale?","Shantanu Narayen","The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products. I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop. So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product. So, that's one area that we're continuing to make sure we invest.","The second one that tends to be a way in which you compete effectively is the inventory. So, I think having the inventory and having the inventory across different kinds of assets, including premium and including partnerships with some of the people that you're talking about, that also helps us ensure that we're competitively, either ahead of the market or at least in line with the market. And the third one that we think about when we think about stock is how good is our technology to find the right asset, based on the intelligence that we can provide. And that's where I think you know we will demonstrate superior advantage to anything else that\u2019s out there. Because our ability to understand these assets and, irrespective of what keyword is being used to search for a particular asset return the right. So in other words search relevance and search is going to be a key part of it.","Now, I think in all three of those, we\u2019re continuing to make great progress. And I think at MAX, we showed you a lot of really cool ways in which we will make that more relevant. It\u2019s an area we\u2019ll continue to invest in. So, we feel good about it Derrick.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Richard Davis","Just real quick question. So it seems to me and you\u2019ve touched on this. So you\u2019re becoming a lot more critical to your customers, and typically that means larger deals. But larger deals have a different selling motion and cadence, and staff dynamics. Could you just talk a little bit about how -- what you believe you need to do to evolve and position yourself to move to larger deals? I mean you obviously keep up with the small stuff too. But that would be helpful. Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","You\u2019re absolutely right. The good news is we\u2019re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products. I would say actually on the field side and on the partner side, we have evolved that over many areas. Where we think we have a world class organization that does that. Because it\u2019s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that we\u2019re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects.","So I actually feel good about all of those. In some cases, you have those deals, the larger the size the time taken can increase, but that\u2019s why we want to build a healthy pipeline and continue to execute against that. So, I feel very good about it, and that is without a doubt one of the areas where we\u2019ve invested in over the last few years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Brent Bracelin","Mark, I wanted to go back to the operating margin, non-GAAP operating margins of 36% this quarter. Should be above where we had thought they\u2019d be. If you go back to last two years, Q1 was the low-point. And then you saw basically improvement throughout the year. Is there something different about this year, or different that we should think about, relative to additional expenses or hiring plans that might be a different sequence? And then as a follow-up to that, if I go back and look at where op margins could go, I think the peak was back in 2008 at 40%. How you\u2019re thinking about the op margin trajectory longer term?","Mark Garrett","There is no difference on the cost side than what you\u2019ve seen in prior years. As I just mentioned a few minutes ago, on the revenue side in Q1, we did have a little bit of the upside coming from some increased perpetual revenue on Acrobat side of the business, on the toolbar distribution deal. And that revenue upside can typically drop-down to the bottom-line pretty readily. So, that\u2019s where you saw a bit more margin than we had guided in the first quarter. Expense wise is no real change to our trajectory, and there hasn\u2019t been for quite some time.","In terms of long-term margins, the best I can do for you right now is few things; one is we\u2019re very focused on margin; you see that in any given quarter; you see that when we over-achieve on revenue like we did Q1. And we gave a three year model a little while back that shows what margins could look like through, at least '18. And if you looked at that model and looked at it back when we gave it to you, you would see margins up above 35%. Beyond that, we will see.","Mike Saviage","Operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions please.","Operator","Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Pat Walravens","Shantanu, probably for you, what key points would you make to investors at this point about your activation strategy going forward, and what you\u2019re looking for?","Shantanu Narayen","We actually feel really good about all of the technology that we have, and we were always on the lookout for small innovative companies. And I think both Mark and I have always talked about; we look for is it bringing our strategic advantage; what is the culture of the companies that we\u2019re looking at, because we are very, very thoughtful about making sure that we continue to expand on the vision of what people want; and the third is financially whether it make sense.","And so we have done some when they make sense. But we feel really good about the core value that we have, and we\u2019ll continue to be on the lookout for things that meet our criteria in all of those; namely, continuing to expand strategically what we can do; ensuring that the culture fit is right, and financially making sense.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open.","Kirk Materne","Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how the upsell stock in the Marketing Cloud customers is going relative to the Creative Cloud. As that would seem to be somewhat of untapped opportunities that we don\u2019t talk perhaps as much about? Just kind of curious how should we think about that as another step forward in terms of stock? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","I think, Kirk, from my point of view as we are going more and more to these large enterprises with solutions across the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and the Marketing Cloud, we have a quarter back model, and the named account model with this quarter back is that they are clearly bringing to bear opportunities like the ones that you are talking about. If you are in there primarily with Marketing Cloud ensuring that we sell more solutions, sale Stock, sale Sign and continue to drive the CC DLAs. And so, I think the model that we have in the field is really one of how do we comprehensively to these larger accounts ensure that they are getting the benefit of the breadth of our solutions.","And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, we\u2019re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services. And the service that is top of mind for as Stock. So, a good question and it's clearly one of the areas that we are focused on.","And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business. But in addition to the great quarterly performance, we\u2019re really excited about the long-term opportunities that we\u2019ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves. And I think we\u2019ll continue to be unique in that, we\u2019re one of the only companies that delivering great top line growth and bottom line earnings.","We're looking forward to next week's Adobe Summit, it's our largest ever. We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision. But thank you for joining us today.","Operator","And this concludes our call.

Adobe is redefining the Creative and Digital Marketing categories with our industry-leading cloud offerings. Through a steady stream of innovation, we will expand adoption of Creative Cloud; grow multi-solution sales of Adobe Marketing Cloud; and drive integration across our cloud offerings. We made progress on all fronts this quarter.","In Q1, we achieved $1 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.30. We drove strong performance across key growth metrics, including Creative Cloud subscriptions, annualized recurring revenue or ARR, and Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings. In Digital Media, Creative Cloud momentum continued. Creative Cloud ARR grew to just under $1 billion in Q1 and we exited with over 1.8 million subscriptions. Driving that customer adoption and satisfaction is the ongoing flow of innovation in the Creative Cloud platform. Coming off our delivery of more than 500 new features and capabilities last year to Creative Cloud subscribers and enterprise users, in Q1 we delivered numerous updates including major features in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. We are excited about the amazing innovation we will deliver in a major update to Creative Cloud in the next few months.","Our digital publishing business continues its momentum, where we are building on our success with publishers in the corporate market, like General Motors and Disney. Last month, we announced the integration of Digital Publishing Suite and Adobe Experience Manager, part of the Adobe Marketing Cloud. This integration enables publishers and brands to create, deliver, and measure experiences across the web and content-rich apps like digital magazines using one set of assets. This enables a faster and more efficient publishing process.","In Document Services, Acrobat continued to achieve solid performance, with online document services continuing their momentum. EchoSign adoption continues, with brands including Citrix, Electronic Arts, Kia, NEC Financial Services and UC Berkeley using our eSignature platform. Combined with Acrobat ETLAs, Document Services ARR grew to $164 million exiting Q1. Between our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $1.15 billion at the end of Q1.","In Digital Marketing, Adobe Marketing Cloud achieved 24% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. We continue to have the most comprehensive offering in the market for Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Revenue Officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers. To create even more impact for our marketing customers, we are focused on integrating our six Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. In January, we announced the integration of Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager. This will allow marketers to use a single digital asset management repository and integrate data from anonymous visitors and identified customers to create personalized customer experiences. Campaign is off to a strong start, as it addresses marketers\u2019 challenge to manage communications with their customers across multiple channels.","Examples of customers licensing multiple Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions in Q1 included GMC, Kohl\u2019s, MGM, NBC Universal and Under Armour. Last month, we had an exciting event when NBC Sports used Adobe Primetime to deliver the Sochi Olympics to desktops, tablets and other mobile devices. Millions of viewers were able to access events live and on-demand. NBC was able to use Primetime\u2019s analytics, authentication, ad delivery and media playback capabilities to stream video across screens. With more than 10.2 million video stream starts, the men\u2019s hockey game between the U.S. and Canada stood out as the biggest, authenticated online event in history.","Next week, we will hold our Digital Marketing Summit in Salt Lake City, with over 5,500 attendees. Summit has become a premier industry venue where we engage with current and prospective customers as well as an ever growing list of global partners. We have a number of significant announcements on the docket as well as an amazing speaker lineup, including senior marketing executives from brands like Audi, FedEx, REI and Sephora.","I am proud to share we donated over $300 million of software and training to the White House\u2019s ConnectED initiative. The goal of ConnectED is to advance digital learning among our youth, and we are excited about enabling 15,000 schools across the country to help students express their creativity and build skills for future success. We delivered another strong quarter and continue to make great progress against our goals in both Digital Media and Digital Marketing. Next week at Summit we will walk you through more details about where we are headed. We hope to see you there.","Now, I will turn it over to Mark.","Mark Garrett","Thanks Shantanu. In the first quarter of FY \u201814, Adobe achieved revenue of $1 billion, at the high end of our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.09, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.30. Highlights in the quarter included: Adding more than 405,000 net new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Creative subscription reported revenue exceeding perpetual licensing revenue for the first time, growing Digital Media ARR by over $200 million to a quarter ending total of $1.15 billion, driving 24% Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth. Increasing deferred revenue by $52 million to a record $881 million. And exiting Q1 with 52% of our $1 billion of Q1 revenue as being recurring, this is truly a major milestone in the company\u2019s transformation.","In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $641 million. This segment has two major components of revenue: our Creative family of products and our Document Services products. In our Creative business, customer adoption of Creative Cloud grew quarter-over-quarter. We exited Q1 with 1.844 million paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions. With this achievement, we hit a milestone, where Q1 reported Creative revenue from subscriptions and ETLAs exceeded reported revenue from perpetual licensing for the first time. Our success with subscriptions, ETLAs and Digital Publishing Suite adoption helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $987 million exiting Q1, an increase of $186 million quarter-over-quarter.","As of the end of Q1, 96% of Creative Cloud subscriptions were annual plans. The percentage of single app subscriptions grew as a percentage of total subscriptions as a result of our successful Photoshop\/Lightroom bundle, which is expanding our overall market opportunity. We are making good progress migrating individual, team and enterprise customers to Creative Cloud. In addition, we are offering incentives to accelerate migration of Creative Suite customers, acquire new creative customers, and further expand in the photography market. Retention and renewal rates after promotions expire continue to track ahead of our internal projections. The resulting average revenue per user, or ARPU, was lower in Q1 as expected.","As a result of Creative Cloud success across teams and enterprises, we will soon end general availability of CS6 perpetual licensing in the channel. This decision is consistent with our comments last December when we stated we expected no material revenue from perpetual licensing of CS6 in the second half of fiscal 2014. We anticipate this change will align channel resellers to exclusively focus on Creative Cloud for team subscriptions.","In Document Services, we achieved revenue of $194 million in Q1. Our success in this category is being driven by continued adoption of Acrobat, Acrobat ETLAs, Acrobat cloud services and our EchoSign e-signing solution. Document Services ARR grew from $143 million exiting Q4 to $164 million exiting Q1. Total Document Services subscriptions spanning EchoSign, Create PDF Online and related services grew to nearly 1.8 million.","In our Digital Marketing segment, there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and in Q1 we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $267 million, representing year-over-year growth of 24% and ahead of our target of 20% growth in FY \u201814. We drove strong bookings in the quarter, which puts us on pace to achieve our target of 30% bookings growth this year. Total transactions managed by all our Marketing Cloud solutions grew to more than 5.4 trillion in Q1. Mobile device use continues to be a driver in our Digital Marketing business. Mobile transactions increased to 36% of total Adobe Analytics transactions, up from 33% last quarter.","Next week at Summit, we are hosting a Financial Analyst Briefing and we intend to update you on numerous metrics, which reflect our leadership and momentum in our Digital Marketing business. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $47 million in Q1 revenue. As a reminder, late last year we introduced a path for LiveCycle customers to migrate to our Adobe Experience Manager offering. As a result, we expect LiveCycle revenue will continue to decline, while Connect revenue will remain relatively flat. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $45 million in Q1. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies.","From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $0.7 million. We had $2.8 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201814 versus $3.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY \u201813. Thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue was $1 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $10.9 million. Comparing the $2.8 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201814 to the $7.1 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201813, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $15.2 million. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 27.5% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher primarily due to stronger than forecasted profits in the U.S.","Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 11,802 versus 11,847 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 44 days in the year ago quarter, and 52 days last quarter.","Cash flow from operations was $252 million in the quarter. And our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.13 billion, compared to $3.17 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 4.5 million shares at a total cost of $263 million.","Now, I would like to go over our financial outlook. In Q2 of FY \u201814, we are targeting a revenue range of $1 billion to $1.50 billion. Assuming the midpoint of our Q2 revenue range, we are targeting total Digital Media and Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to grow sequentially. We also expect LiveCycle and Connect revenue to decline sequentially. And we are targeting Print and Publishing revenue to be relatively flat.","During the quarter, we expect to add approximately the same number of Creative Cloud subscriptions and amount of Digital Media ARR as what was achieved in Q1. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be 508 million to 510 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $16 million and $18 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of 28% to 29% on a GAAP and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.06 to $0.12 per share, and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.26 to $0.32.","Looking to the second half of the year, in the coming months we are planning a major launch of our Creative products and the removal of legacy CS6 products from the channel. We expect both of these will cause channel partners and our customers to increase their focus on Creative Cloud adoption. Finally, based on this roadmap, and factoring our Q1 performance and our Q2 targets, we expect we will meet or exceed all of the annual FY \u201814 targets we provided in December. These targets are available in the financial targets document on our Investor Relations website.","I will now turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks Mark.

We would now be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open.","Brent Thill - UBS","Good afternoon. On the Adobe Marketing Cloud, it was a little shy of what I think our estimate in the Street was at, I was just curious if you could just walk through the dynamics there? And I realized you\u2019re still guiding to 20% plus growth, can just maybe walk through where you see kind of the lowest hanging fruit in that business in the dynamics in the market? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. I will take that Brent. I mean, when we look at the prospects for the Marketing Cloud, we continue to be very optimistic. The bookings were strong during the quarter. As you know in the enterprise business, you have a seasonally weak Q1 after what was an extremely strong Q4, but when we look at it big picture, we just continue to see great awareness, good traction with all of our solutions, people adopting the new solutions rather than point products. And I am sure you will get a lot more information next week at Summit and Campaign was off to a strong start, so that adds to another solution that we have now as part of the offering. So, we continue to be very excited about the prospects for the Marketing Cloud.","Brent Thill - UBS","And just a quick follow-up, in terms of the duration of some of the contracts customers are signing, can you just give us a sense of what the general trend you are seeing there?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. I mean, I think people are still continuing to sign contracts. And I would say the average is probably 18 months, Brent, but it\u2019s \u2013 you have multiple that are three years and retention continues to be fairly high in that space.","Brent Thill - UBS","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Ken Wong - Citigroup","Hi guys. This is Ken Wong for Walter. Just a quick question on the point products, I mean, you noted that, that was driving some of the subscriber adds this quarter, I think the last time you guys updated us on the mix, it was about 80% were on the full Creative, I mean, how should we think about the mix going forward? Does that trend closer to kind of roughly two-thirds being on a full suite that you guys had when it was a desktop product?","Shantanu Narayen","I would think, Ken, that overall we would continue to have a higher mix for the entire Creative Cloud when we think about the Creative Cloud offering as opposed to the equivalent comparison with the Creative Suite product. And when we think about what happened in Q1, overall unit demand for the Creative products continue to be really strong and I think you will see mix changes during the quarter as long as we continue to have the perpetual option. The other thing I would say is we saw a lot of strength with new customer acquisition in the Photoshop and Lightroom bundle that was quite well received, but overall I would say that we continue to expect that overall mix in the Creative Cloud will continue to be towards the entire offering.","Ken Wong - Citigroup","Got you. And then just \u2013 go ahead.","Mark Garrett","I was just going to add to that, this is Mark, that like I mentioned we have this major launch coming with a big marketing campaign. And as we said, we are going to take CLP and TLP out of the channel and those two actions together are going to help drive Creative adoption and ARR in the second half of the year.","Ken Wong - Citigroup","Got you. And then Mark, you mentioned raising well you guys would beat the financial guidance you guys laid out there for fiscal year \u201814, does that also include the 3 million Creative Cloud subs?","Mark Garrett","Yes. All the targets we laid out we feel good about meeting or exceeding.","Shantanu Narayen","I would again continue to impress like I think we have for investors that the annualized recurring revenue is really the right long-term way to look at the health of the business. We are off to a strong Q1. And again as Mark said, that gives us confidence for us to expect to continue to beat the targets that we have. We are just not updating the guidance every quarter, annual guidance.","Ken Wong - Citigroup","Got you. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks so much. Shantanu, I was interested in where you guys might be seeing leverage between the Creative Cloud and the Marketing Cloud and I am guessing it something will see more of next week, but do you have any commentary on that or how we might start to think about the TAM or new opportunities that you are seeing as those two products increasingly get used together?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. We are seeing actually more and more, Brendan, it\u2019s a good question. I mean I will give you some customer examples. The publishing industry certainly, they want a single asset repository and workflow to create content once and repurpose it across web and mobile applications and video. We are seeing in retail actually a number of innovative customers are looking to accelerate the entire time to market. So they have their design done with hopefully an enterprise version of the Creative Cloud ETLA. And then they are actually providing that design directly through manufacturing, through the workflow that we have, so instead of using traditional product databases they are actually using our content repository system.","We are seeing marketers accelerate campaigns by having the content assets directly flow into the marketing platform. And you know in video, I think you are seeing creation, delivery and ad insertion also all done through a single system like Primetime. The two products that we have specifically in that space the digital asset management that\u2019s represented within the Adobe Experience Manager and also we have the integration right now between DPS and AEM. So hopefully that gives you some color of how customers are actually aggressively wanting us to further integrate both within the clouds and across clouds.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Great. Thanks. And Mark just a quick one, any reason to assume Creative Cloud subscribers would decline sequentially at any point through the second half of the year?","Mark Garrett","Not based on what we see coming with the launch and like I said the removal of CLP and TLP from the channel. We are feeling good about subscribers and growing them in the back half of the year?","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Mark Garrett","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the Creative Cloud mix in the quarter, in particular any color around demand from individual or a team versus ETLA?","Shantanu Narayen","Well Jennifer, I think demand from individuals continues to be strong. I think the ETLA pipeline again you traditionally have a strong close to Q4 and then we start building up the pipeline in Q1. And so ETLAs will see a sequential seasonal decline between Q4 and Q1 and team continues to get stronger every quarter as we see both CS6 being longer in the tooth as it relates to channel fulfilling demand from the customers as well as people looking at the value added innovation that\u2019s available through the Creative Cloud, team continues to get stronger. So that hopefully gives you color. And if you look at the individual application mix versus the overall you will also see that the Photoshop\/Lightroom combination did well. As we have done survey on those customers we are definitely seeing market expansion and attracting new customers to the platform.","Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley","Great and just a quick follow-up clarification question, Mark to your answer earlier to Brendan, you said that you expect Creative Cloud subscribers to continue growth throughout the year, should we expect the rate of subscriber adds to grow throughout the year I just wanted to clarify that?","Mark Garrett","I didn\u2019t get that specific but again with the launch and the removal of CLP, TLP in the back of the year, we would expect subscribers to grow. I would leave it at that for now.","Jennifer Lowe - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of from the line of Ross MacMillan from Jefferies. You line is open.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","Thank you and congratulations. Mark you mentioned that the Creative subscription revenue was greater than perpetual licenses for the first time, is there any more color you can provide around that approximate mix between the two in Q1?","Mark Garrett","I don\u2019t know is that we want to get that specific I mean what, like I said on the call it\u2019s really pleasing to see more than half of our total revenue in the quarter coming from ratable sources now and more of the Creative revenue coming from recognized subscription revenue than from perpetual revenue. We did say that a couple of times now that perpetual revenue really falls off dramatically in the back half of year, again even more so now with the CLP TLP coming out of the channel. So I think it gets fairly de minimis like we talked about in the back half of the year.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","And just on that removal of the Creative Suite from the channel, does that apply also to direct sales as well so from adobe.com or through other mechanisms, in other words will it be basically impossible to get your hands on Creative Suite in the second half of the year?","Shantanu Narayen","No, Ross. I mean, the way we are looking at it we first feel that the offering that will be coming out later this year is going to be so strong. CS6 is definitely going to look longer in the tooth. I mean, we have created all of the appropriate training with the channel partners as well as making sure, the two licensing programs that we had CLP and TLP, both of them will still be available. We will in certain markets continue to offer the licensing. Again, that would be de minimis in the second quarter. And then electronic software download, you will continue to see us offer that, but even today honestly on adobe.com, the vast, vast majority of all purchases is clearly the subscription. So, Adobe.com has already made that transition. The direct enterprise business is all driving ETLAs. The channel mix is slightly different, but we feel so confident that we now have the product offering, we have the appropriate way for both the channels to resell our products as well as for people who are acquiring it within enterprises to have an admin console. I mean, all of that just leads us to make sure that we have a unified story about what the right product is for all of our customers.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","That\u2019s really helpful. Maybe one last one just on ARPU, obviously it was lower as you expected in Q1 as a result of the Photoshop\/Lightroom shift. Given the changes that are coming here in the second half, would you expect ARPU to actually begin to increase given I think the changes are going to drive more traditional suite users to move to the full Creative Cloud, I was just curious so that ARPU trend that you see this year?","Mark Garrett","Yes. So I mentioned this in the script, Ross. But again, the best measure of the business we still believe is ARR, because that incorporates everything obviously. And as we looked at the segmented offerings with individual team and enterprise, ARPU was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter across each of those offerings, but in aggregate, it was down due to mix and still remains kind of in the mid 30s, which we feel good about. And like we have said, over the longer term we feel that there is plenty of opportunity to drive that ARPU up. Right now, we want to drive subscriber adoption and we are going to do things that are prudent to do that, but again, ARPU remains in the mid-30s and it was affected by mix this quarter more than anything else.","Shantanu Narayen","And directionally, Ross, if you actually look at the ARPU, when you take out the Photoshop\/Lightroom bundle, it was actually up slightly. And so again completely on strategy in terms of execution when we get Creative Cloud, we get people to renew at the upper price, all of that\u2019s working well. So we continue to see an expansion opportunity with Photoshop\/Lightroom, but if you remove the SLR from the mix, ARPU was actually slightly up?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you very much guys. Nice cover on the new sub adds. Mark, can you talk about the 12.8 million subscriber base that you disclosed at the Analyst Day back in May and what percentage of that is roughly the breakup between commercial versus education government? And do you think that this ARPU of mid-30s can sustain even if you were to go back to a mix in your subscription base with CC as you get back into cumulative CS base of 12.8 million? That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Kash, to be honest, we are not going to be updating that installed base migration at least not on the call here. That\u2019s something that we would do maybe down the road at an Analyst Day or something, but like we said we continue to see good adoption from people that are both perpetual users as well as new users on Creative Cloud.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","So is it possible then to give us some feel for when you have more of a normal mix of education versus commercial in your Creative Cloud subscriber base, how do we expect the ARPU to shape up our ASP to shape up, is it I mean relatively flat? How do you feel about the integrated pricing in the so-called non-commercial markets? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Well, in the non-commercial markets, I think when we think about education, Kash, I mean it will continue to be a seating strategy in order to get people and it will probably be a lower ARPU much like the ARPU was lower when we think about what we had with the Creative Suite. We also continue to offer ETLAs within educational institutions, which is doing well. So the direct sales force has moved to educational institutions. So when we think about the education market specifically think of it as individuals within the education whether they are students, whether they are administrators or whether they are faculty they will have the ability to get Creative Cloud at a lower price point. You will have the equivalent of team for deployment within labs that product is also going to get updated as we talked about and at the higher end for enterprises. But it\u2019s a great seating strategy and it allows us to continue to have people embrace our products as the products of choice as they embark on a creative career.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","Thanks very much. I was just going to inquire about the dichotomy between your performance in geographies with your Asia-Pacific market being down 22% year-over-year. I was just wondering if you can give us a little color on that, does that have to do anything with the adoption of Creative Suite there and how that might have performed versus your expectation?","Shantanu Narayen","Clearly, Creative Suite started off strong in the U.S. and we are rolling it out kind of around the world it\u2019s like anything else it seems to kind of move from the U.S. to Europe to Asia. So Asia has probably got the biggest opportunity in terms of Creative Cloud adoption moving forward. I don\u2019t think there was anything we saw Steve around the world from a demand perspective that was troubling. Like I said, we saw stable demand across all the geographies. So it was nothing unusual in the numbers. And there is definitely upside on Creative Cloud adoption in Asia.","Mark Garrett","And when we talk Steve about digital marketing I think we have made it explicit about our focus on developed economies as the first area of focus and so as the percentage of digital marketing revenue in our overall revenue mix grows that will also show up more disproportionately in both the U.S. as well as in Europe.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","It\u2019s helpful. Maybe one last thing Mark, in the past you have been able to give us the ETLA ARR as a metric, I was wondering if we could get that at this time?","Mark Garrett","Yes, we actually have not split that out in the past I mean it\u2019s fairly straightforward if you take the ARPU in the mid-30s times the number of users that we told you about in the quarter. You can kind of back into an enterprise ETLA ARR number. We have never really broken it out to be honest Steve.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. You line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Thank you. Good evening. I would like to ask first about businesses where you get paid in effect or at least in part based on customer activity, Shantanu you have alluded to DPS and I was wondering if you could update us a bit more on how that\u2019s progressing and another business where you in affect get paid according to customers activity such as Media Optimizer and whether there were any other opportunities like those to where you could be on the meter in terms of revenue like those first two I mentioned then would follow-up?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure Jay. I mean I think with DPS we might have mention that we had about 150 million downloads. I think if we update that, it would be closer to 170 million right now. And so that traction continues. What\u2019s exciting about DPS is that actually a lot of the new business is in commercial accounts as I think we mentioned, so that that all goes well for us as we see deployment within enterprises. Media Optimizer continues to do well, grow year-over-year in terms of the annualized marketing spend that we have. But I would actually say that all of Marketing Cloud is really transaction based. And when you sort of look at what\u2019s happening with mobile and the move towards mobile devices and mobile traffic, I mean that is driving whether it is the number of multichannel messages that are communicated, whether that\u2019s the amount of advertising spend that we do, whether it\u2019s the amount of targeted offers that are going out on behalf of our customers. So the good thing about the Marketing Cloud is that as transaction volume increases with mobile clearly driving adoption that actually all goes well for all of Marketing Cloud.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Okay. The second question has to do with your services and support revenue you had mentioned a quarter ago during Q&A that customers don\u2019t want to do their own integration as far as digital marketing is concerned and your various solutions and you alluded to the same this evening. But we noticed that your services revenue were down sequentially and year-over-year, is that a function of older maintenance running off an older LiveCycle and Connect services revenue running off, but underneath it all you are seeing growing engagements in services revenue for Marketing Cloud than anything else?","Shantanu Narayen","Jay, I will let Mark answer that specifically. I think big picture as it relates to people adopting Creative Cloud, you are seeing more and more partners in the ecosystem who are standardizing on the Adobe Marketing Cloud. And again, I think you will see some exciting announcements next week about how more and more people are creating digital practices on our marketing platform. And so our strategy continues to be how do we engage those partners, how do we educate those partners, and for some of the key customers, we will certainly be prime, but we want the entire ecosystem to evolve.","Mark Garrett","And then Jay, you are right, on the services line to the extent that we have more and more customers adopting ETLAs, which is consistent with our strategy and where the sales forces really performing very well, you will see maintenance falloff on the old model and move into more of an ETLA model for Creative.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","One clarification, sorry Mark, one quick clarification regarding adobe.com, where you said the vast majority of Creative Cloud subs activity is occurring, is the total amount of adobe.com revenue now larger than it would have been two years ago before you began the transition when you were still relying largely on perpetual business going through the site?","Mark Garrett","Honestly, I have to look at that, Jay. I don\u2019t know about the recognized subscription revenue specifically from adobe.com versus perpetual from adobe.com. I would think that if it\u2019s not there already, it\u2019s certainly going to get there, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s there yet.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great, thank you so much. And I apologize, because I have juggling between a couple of different calls tonight, but I was wondering you talked a lot in the year ago if we go back to the Marketing Summit that you had, you talked about how you are integrating your products. I mean one of the things we hear from looking at the sales forces in the Facebooks and the Googles of the world as people would like one dashboard to kind of manage all their different marketing offerings and I think you guys are obviously in the pole position to offer that. I am just wondering if you could share with us kind of the current experiences of some of the customers that you have been winning as a result of that and what the common themes are and what you think the opportunity is to kind of increase that penetration into your installed base?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Heather. So, as you know, we announced at the last Marketing Summit that we would be moving all of the 20 or 30 products that we had into essentially five solutions that then got expanded when we made the Neolane acquisition into Adobe Campaign. If I look at our results for Q1, the vast majority of that revenue is now coming from solution. So it\u2019s clear that people are buying the solutions as opposed to the individual point products and some of those solutions again have multiple point products of the past. So that\u2019s one really positive dataset. The second one is as we delivered Adobe Campaign, which was off to a strong start it comes with the same user experience. So we have already built a single dashboard that allows people to in a unified way, use all of our different solutions. I think that two other things maybe I will leave you with. The first is managed services when we have an Adobe Experience Manager solution, it provides us with a great opportunity to not just have the Adobe Experience Manager solution as part of the installation, but to actually have all the solutions ready to go and all that a customer has to do is to turn it on rather than to explicitly have to contract with us. And finally, I think one of the things that is exciting for us is a lot of the CMOs are now looking at it and saying whether it\u2019s their spend across multiple channels, whether it\u2019s their communication across multiple channels, the entire media mix and attribution we are uniquely qualified to solve that for CMOs across their entire marketing spend. And so stay tuned for some exciting announcements in that front as well.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Thank you so much.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Siti Panigrahi - Credit Suisse","Thanks. This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. Could you touch on the competitive environment in marketing given the continued consolidation in the space? And also I wanted to ask about the acquisition of Neolane, any initial feedback from customer and how should we look for Neolane to be more integrated into Marketing Cloud?","Shantanu Narayen","I will do the second one first. I mean it\u2019s already integrated, it\u2019s Adobe Campaign. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that it\u2019s off to a strong start and so having that multichannel orchestration capabilities across all of our offerings across all the channels is a very strong add already to the Marketing Cloud. I think in terms of what\u2019s happening in a competitive landscape, you are right. I mean there is more activity because it\u2019s probably the most explosive new enterprise software category. And I think our D&A about creativity and marketers continued to give us a lot of optimism about how we are going to perform in this. We are the leaders and we are going to continue to differentiate honestly by integrating entire content delivery into this platform. So hopefully that gives you some indication. But yes there is more competition I think it\u2019s just raising awareness of the entire category. And if you look at the industry analyst reports, we continue to be the leader not just in the entire platform but also in individual solutions.","Mike Saviage","Operator, we will take two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood from Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open is open.","Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group","Great. Thanks. Shantanu you just mentioned that the customers are shifting to solution deployments in the Marketing Cloud, I am just curious if there is any general metric you can provide in terms of the ASP uplift from this change?","Shantanu Narayen","I think you are going to hear some of that next week. You do know we are doing an FA summit there as well Derrick. So we will leave some information for you to come listen to both the announcements as well as an update on the business.","Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And just a follow-up on the Marketing Cloud, I mean given the publicity from the breach at target, I know that\u2019s more on the point of sale side of things, but I am just curious if that\u2019s having any impact in spending trends kind of in the e-commerce vertical?","Shantanu Narayen","No, I think customer behavior is really driving more e-commerce across every single device and I don\u2019t know of a single customer that \u2013 of a single customer or partner who doesn\u2019t believe that the move towards online digital commerce is going to diminish. So it\u2019s just going to increase.","Derrick Wood - Susquehanna Financial Group","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Breza from Sterne Agee. Your line is open is open.","Rob Breza - Sterne Agee","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Mark, maybe just a quick question I know was asked a little bit beforehand, but as you think about the geographical mix, I know Asia was around 16% for the last two quarters here, is that a trend or should we expect it\u2019s kind of return back to that normal 20%? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Well, I think over the right period of time, you will see Asia come back to where it was. And there is no reason to believe that it wouldn\u2019t like that both I and Shantanu said they are going to be a little bit behind on Creative Cloud adoption. They are certainly behind on Digital Marketing adoption. And as perpetual falls off more and more that changes the mix, but there is no reason to believe that those mixes shouldn\u2019t come back to where they were over the longer period.","Shantanu Narayen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you again for joining us. We are executing well against the strategy and feel really great about the progress we have made. When we look at it, we think Q1 was a strong start in both our growth initiatives. In Digital Marketing, we do have the most comprehensive marketing platform, strong year-over-year bookings growth and we will share more details on the roadmap as well as industry partnerships that we are signing to accelerate that business. And in Digital Media, the strength of Q1 coupled with the innovation that we are on track to deliver later this summer leads us to expect to exceed the annual target that we had provided. We look forward to seeing you at Summit. Thank you.","Mike Saviage - Vice President, Investor Relations","This concludes our call.

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; and Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO.","In the call today, we will discuss Adobe's third quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results.

The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Adobe delivered strong results in Q3 with revenue of $1.218 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54. Strong Creative Cloud Adoption and record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue drove these results.","In digital media, Creative Cloud has become the de facto platform for all creatives, providing the tools and services to fulfill every creative need. We are migrating customers from our Creative suite installed base as well as attracting new users with strong adoption across our individual team and enterprise offerings.","Net new Creative Cloud subscriptions grew by 684,000 during Q3 and we exited the quarter with over 5.3 million subscriptions. Combining this adoption with the annual value of enterprise agreements in success with Adobe Stock, Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR achieved sequential growth of $262 million. We exited the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of Creative ARR.","Continuous innovation is the hallmark of Creative Cloud and the catalyst for our retention and growth. In the video space Adobe continues to trail blaze. Last week at IBC 2015, Europe\u2019s largest professional broadcast conference, we announced the next wave of Creative Cloud innovation coming soon to Adobe Premier Pro. Featuring groundbreaking support for Ultra HD, brilliant color technology improvements, a new touch work flows, Premier Pro is the leader in professional video.","We see a large growth opportunity in enabling film and broadcast customers to transition to an entirely Adobe based workflow. Marquee customers continue to make the switch to Premier Pro. 20th Century Fox is using Adobe\u2019s Video Solution for its upcoming movie Deadpool which opens in February.","Creative Cloud innovation is forging ahead in the mobile space where our mission is to help Creatives bridge their desktop and mobile design processes into a seamless Creative workflow. One of our most anticipated mobile apps Photoshop Fix debuted last week on stage at Apple\u2019s launch event.","Photoshop Fix will deliver incredible retouching capabilities to a mainstream mobile first audience while providing pros with a handy tool for quick edits. Our plan to deliver new values with services such as Adobe Stock to augment our desktop and mobile applications is off to a strong start. Customers appreciate the deep integration of Adobe Stock in our Creative applications and are adopting Creative Cloud subscription offerings that include Adobe Stock.","We will continue to deliver new services and partner with a broader ecosystem to make Creative Cloud the one stop shop for Creative inspiration. In July we announced our next generation digital publishing solution. Already the leader in the publishing segment, our new DPS offering will enable brands to easily repurpose their existing marketing content into immersive mobile apps without writing code.","Next month we will hold our Max Creativity Conference in Los Angeles. Max has become the annual meeting place for the Creative community and we expect this to be our biggest event ever. We are excited to showcase how customers are changing the world with their creativity and we will unveil our newest Creative Cloud technology.","In our documents business, reception to our new Adobe Document Cloud and Acrobat DC has been positive. Success with the new launch helps to drive Document Cloud revenue of $194 million in Q3. We grew Document Cloud ARR to $357 million exiting the quarter. Document Cloud ARR is increasing based on Enterprise Adoption as well as the growth of individual subscriptions with new users.","We continue to expand our offering in e-signatures through integrations with a vibrant and growing enterprise partner ecosystem including Ariba, Salesforce and Workday. Across our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses, total digital media ARR grew to $2.65 billion as of the end of Q3.","Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the leader in the exploding digital marketing category offering the most complete set of solutions and a robust partner network with strong bookings in Q3 and record marketing cloud revenue of $368 million, representing 27% year-over-year growth.","In July, we held sold out Digital Marketing events in Sydney and Singapore where we hosted thousands of marketers for a day of inspiration, education, and networking. Customers on stage included Starwood Hotels and Resorts Unilever, Nestl\u00e9, Rakuten, and Tourism Australia. Next week we will host nearly 2,000 customers at our symposia in Tokyo and San Francisco.","Partners continue to be a critical part of our digital marketing strategy. Last week we announced the WPP Adobe Alliance and expanded partnership with WPP, one of the world\u2019s largest agency networks. WPP agencies will become certified Adobe Marketing Cloud experts with the skills required to design and develop, sell, deploy and operate our solutions throughout their network.","Adobe announced a major advancement in our programmatic ad platform for advertisers and media publishers leveraging fully integrated solutions in Adobe Marketing Cloud. Powered by Adobe media optimizer, the new self-service technology allows advertisers to take direct control of automated ad buying for search, display, and social media across ad exchanges and media networks like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo!.","Tight integration with Adobe Analytics and Adobe Audience Manager, ensures that advertisers can tap into data to refine and target granular audience segments. Dynamic creative capabilities enable advertisers to use images, videos, and other assets from Creative Cloud to deliver the right content to the right user at the right time.","In addition to making this programmatic platform available to advertisers, Adobe also announced its programmatic offering for media publishers. Adobe Primetime, Adobe's TV platform, now supports over the top and direct to consumer offerings with audience acquisition, engagement, monetization, and measurement capabilities. Recently launched services benefiting from Adobe Primetime include HBO Now, Showtime, MLB and Sony Pictures Entertainment.","Industry analysts continue to recognize our solutions as market leading in their categories. Last month Gartner named Adobe as a leader in two Magic Quadrant reports. Web content management where we were ranked highest in completeness of vision and mobile application development.","Earlier today we announced some changes to our executive team. David Wadhwani has decided to leave Adobe, to pursue a CEO opportunity and we\u2019ve named Brian Lampkin to head up the combined digital media business. Brian, who currently leads the Document Cloud business is no stranger to the Creative business having being one of the architects of both Photoshop and Creative Suite. Under Brian's leadership we have the opportunity to further align Creative Cloud and Document Cloud product development and go to market efforts. I want to thank David for his numerous contributions and wish him well.","In July we announced Abhay Parasnis, as our new CTO. Abhay has 20 years of experience in enterprise software industry and his charter is to drive Adobe's overall technology strategy, architecture and innovation roadmap for cloud services.","Human resources are our capital at Adobe. In Q3 we announced a new employee leave policy. Progressive benefits such as this help us be recognized as one of the best places to work and enable us to attract and retain incredible talent including a record number of new college hires. Great software comes from great people.","I look forward to seeing many of you at our Financial Analyst meeting at MAX in October. Mark?","Mark Garrett","In the third quarter of FY15, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.218 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.34 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.54.","Highlights in our third quarter include, accelerating adoption of Creative Cloud which helps to grow Creative ARR to almost $2.03 billion exiting Q3. Building total Digital Media ARR to $2.65 billion which is the sum of Creative ARR plus another strong quarter of Document Cloud ARR growth. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $368 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth, delivering strong year-over-year growth in operating and net income; growing deferred revenue to a record $1.3 billion; achieving strong cash flow from operations of $360 million, and exiting Q3 with a record 73% recurring revenue.","In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $770 million. This segment has two major components of revenue, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. As we have said, the best overall measure of the health of our creative business is Creative ARR, and in Q3 growth of Creative ARR was strong. We added $262 million of Creative ARR during the quarter, driven by strong net new Creative Cloud subscription ads of 684,000. Te exited the quarter with 5,334,000 Creative Cloud subscriptions.","Our investor data sheet on adobe.com reflects a favorable adjustment of Creative Cloud subscriptions. We slightly underreported Creative Cloud subscriptions due to how retail point of sale or POSA units were reported. The adjustment added approximately 40,000 net new subscriptions over the prior three quarters. Across all routes to market, we continue to see strong demand for Creative Cloud. We are migrating existing customers to Creative Cloud and are attracting large numbers of first-time customers.","In addition, we are now migrating significant numbers of hobbyist customers who previously used Photoshop Elements and Lightroom on a perpetual basis to the Creative Cloud photography subscription offering. Adobe Stock is contributing to both ARR and ARPU. Creative Cloud ARPU was consistent with Q2 and Creative Cloud Retention remains strong.","With our Document Cloud products, we achieved Q3 revenue of $194 million. Adoption of our new Document Cloud offering that shipped during Q2 has been solid, helping to grow Document Cloud ARR to $357 million exiting Q3. Document Cloud reported revenue remains relatively flat as we continue to drive towards our goal of more acrobat subscriptions, which is reflected in the Document Cloud ARR growth.","In our Digital Marketing segment there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $368 million, up 27% year-over-year. Despite currency impact, based on our strong Q3 bookings, we remain on track to achieve 30% or greater Marketing Cloud bookings growth for the year. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $34 million in Q3 revenue.","Print and Publishing segment revenue was $46 million in Q3. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $6 million. We had $9 million in hedge gains in Q3, FY15, versus $22 million in hedge gains in Q2, FY15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $19 million.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $58 million. Considering the $9 million in hedge gains in Q3, FY15, versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q3, FY14, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $50 million.","In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 25% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis, consistent with our targets for the quarter. Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 13,665 versus 13,266 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 44 days which compares to 48 days in the year-ago quarter and 39 days last quarter.","Cash flow from operations was $360 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.31 billion, up 31% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.67 billion compared to $3.41 billion at the end of Q2. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $132 million.","Now, I\u2019d like to provide our financial outlook. Our overall business remains strong across our key product segments and geographies. We continue to drive large portions of our legacy perpetual businesses to a recurring model and this shift has improved the overall long-term health of our business. ARR deferred revenue and unbilled backlog have all grown faster than expected with some short-term impact to revenue.","In Digital Media, we have discussed how the transition to subscriptions is happening faster in Creative. We're now seeing a similar trend with Acrobat Lightroom and Photoshop Elements. As a result, we\u2019ve consistently raised our Digital Media ARR targets and we\u2019re doing so again for Q4 FY15. Our new Digital Media ARR target existing this year is 2.95 billion with slightly lower revenue in Q4 than previously expected.","In Digital Marketing, we are driving larger, multi-year and multi-solution customer contracts. As a result of larger engagements and longer implementation cycles, we are seeing strong growth in deferred revenue and unbilled backlog. We are targeting a Q4 revenue range for Adobe Marketing Cloud of $365 million to $400 million based on the potential variability of contracts that closes perpetual versus ratable licensing. We are therefore targeting an overall Adobe Q4 revenue range of $1,275,000,000 to $1,325,000,000.","We expect our Q4 share account to be between 506 million to 508 million shares. We're targeting net non-operating expense to be between $40 million and $60 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of approximately 25% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.32 to $0.38 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.56 to $0.62.","In summary, we delivered record results once again and are focused on a strong finish in Q4. We remain excited about our long-term growth prospects and look forward to sharing a financial roadmap with you at MAX in a few weeks. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks Mark. As we have discussed, Adobe MAX is coming up next month in Los Angeles with the main keynote presentation on Monday, October 5.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Steven Ashley","Great. Thanks so much. Mark, I\u2019d just like to drill down, you talked about the fourth quarter, the revenue guidance being slightly lower than you had originally expected. You laid out the fact that there has been a conversion outside of Creative Cloud with some of the single products. Wonder if you could just talk about which of those products might be seeing the most aggressive transition, and maybe the magnitude of the impact of that dynamic?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. Steve, let me again maybe just touch on what we're seeing happening across the industry and then I think we can have Mark answer that specific question, because the industry shift to the subscription business model which clearly is helping drive both customer intimacy as well as productivity in the -- predictability in the business we clearly see that accelerating. As you know we were the pioneer in moving desktop software to the cloud and now we see actually all major software vendors on the desktop adopt similar strategies. And from a color point of view while the Creative business has mostly transitioned, what we are seeing is the same trends and increased adoption of subscription in both our imaging hobbyists business where Photoshop Elements customers are now subscribing instead to the Creative Cloud photography program and Acrobat users especially on adobe.com are moving increasingly to the subscription offering much like what I think Microsoft is also seeing with Office 365. So that's just a big trend that we are seeing across. ","On the Enterprise side, Steve, it's slightly different because the trend has a little more variability based on industry verticals as to their preference of whether they want to go with the subscription or ratable versus perpetual. And so the overall mix may be a little harder to predict, but the strength of our overall business during the transition is not being impacted. So maybe with that as a big picture of what we are seeing Mark can address your question.","Mark Garrett","Yes, so Steve on the Digital Media side, Shantanu just touched on and it\u2019s Hobbyist, it\u2019s Lightroom, and it\u2019s Acrobat. And if you look at ARR, because as you know for the past four years we\u2019ve been talking about this transition, if you look at ARR over the course of this year, we raised it twice. We started at 2.9 billion. In Q2 we raised it to 2.925, now in Q3 we are raising it another 25 million to 2.5 billion. That $50 million increase in ARR if you use that old rule of thumb that we used to have of each dollar of ARR is roughly $3 of revenue that\u2019s a lot of revenue. It\u2019s moved over during the course of this year. So from a Digital Media perspective you clearly see it in ARR. ","On the Digital Marketing side, it\u2019s a similar story, but slightly different metrics. So we had some perpetual in the fourth quarter that closed early in Q3, that\u2019s why you saw 27% year over growth instead of 21% year over growth. We are seeing larger multi-year deals and those deals are great to locking customers but they have as we said longer implementation cycles. What you\u2019re going to see though is on the Digital Marketing side reflected in deferred revenue and unbilled backlog, really nice increases. And so by the end of this year, I\u2019d anticipate that the two of those together deferred and unbilled backlog will be over $3.5 billion. That\u2019s $3.5 billion of closed business that will get recognized to revenue over time. So that\u2019s really healthy both in Digital Media on the ARR side and Digital Marketing on the deferred and unbilled backlog side.","Steven Ashley","Perfect. Really helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Great. Thanks a lot and congrats on a great quarter. Just two questions from me. Just on the sub adds, Mark, you have the mix between full Creative Cloud and single app, do you have that?","Mark Garrett","I do. Its 54% fall 46 -- and 46% point. Yes, 54%, 46%.","Ross MacMillan","That\u2019s interesting. I guess, along those lines are you starting to see -- I know you will talk about this at MAX, but are you starting to see a better sort of shift, if you will, from that Creative Suite base excluding the CS6 base to the Creative Cloud now that we\u2019re three years after the launch of CS6. I\u2019m just curious to get a sense for what we\u2019re seeing there?","Shantanu Narayen","Ross, I will take that. And yes we\u2019re definitely seeing a good mix. I think we\u2019ve characterized the CS6 base as a healthy base for us to migrate to the Creative Cloud. And to give you an example of that one of the things that we had been talking about is how international adoption in the past was lagging the adoption of Creative Cloud within the U.S. In the quarter that just finished, we saw some great progress with respect to migrating the CS6 base in Japan. So Japan had a good quarter and as you know the perpetual business was healthier there later in the cycle relative to the U.S. And so clearly the CS6 base continues to be a base that we think is ripe for migration to the Creative Cloud and we\u2019re clearly seeing signs of success in transitioning them from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud.","Ross MacMillan","That's great. Maybe one if I could squeeze it. Just on Digital Marketing, Mark last year we\u2019ve the shift where I think you went to 75% term ratable. If we get to low end of the Q4 revenues, where we\u2019re going to stand in that sort of ratable mix within Digital Marketing Cloud? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","If we were at the lower end that would mean most of the perpetual in Q4 would have moved over to subscription, because the pull in of that perpetual into Q3 was a piece of what we were anticipating in Q4 and then the range that you see is basically a mix of perpetual moving to subscription depending on whether you\u2019re at the high end or the low end. There would be very little left at the low end.","Ross MacMillan","That\u2019s great. Congrats again. Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","And our next call comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. A question just on Digital Marketing. Mark, you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing larger deals, you\u2019re seeing longer deals, I\u2019m just curious if you can just give us a little more color around perhaps what you\u2019re seeing in the overall lift of ASPs and when you look at the contract duration, is there been a change in terms of what you\u2019re seeing, maybe you could comment on what the duration is and I had a quick follow-up just as it relates to Digital Marketing.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. Brent, why don\u2019t I give you a little bit of color on what\u2019s happening with Digital Marketing. As you know when we first started the business and we had these different solutions, we would be selling primarily to practitioners who continue to be important buyer within the companies. And when we were selling into the practitioners, the practitioners would implement the product of virtually instantly and we recognize revenue and it\u2019s up and running. As more and more customers are adopting the entire Creative Cloud and multiple solutions, what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re standardizing on the Adobe Solution, but the sequence with which they implement each of the solutions is still they implement one then they may implement others. And so what Mark was alluding to was these deals if they are in the million dollar plus range, it has to do with more solutions being acquired and then them implementing it sequentially, which is why you see it in unbilled backlog and you see it in deferred revenue, but you don\u2019t see it translate to revenue as quickly. From our point of view that\u2019s all great, because they\u2019re standardizing on our platform, the value proposition of the entire marketing cloud is working with them Brent and we recognize that in the large -- in the bigger picture, it\u2019s actually a more predictable and healthy business for us. The other thing that\u2019s also seeing good traction is the managed services, which again is in our best interest, because those deal sizes are larger and we\u2019ve tremendous visibility into how they\u2019re using our solutions.","Brent Thill","Okay. And just -- so I\u2019m clear, you\u2019ve been talking about 30% backlog growth for quite sometime yet. The revenue has been understated and it feels like that the milestone to hit that keeps getting pushed out, is there anything else that we should consider or is this just naturally because of the issues that you just brought up I think there is a lot of questions around that that\u2019s been off for quite sometime?","Mark Garrett","Yes, I understand Brent. It\u2019s Mark. I think you meant 30% bookings growth, you said backlog \u2026","Brent Thill","That\u2019s right.","Mark Garrett","\u2026but yes 30% bookings growth, no there nothing else going on. I mean, that\u2019s really what it is. A lot of it is just moment of perpetual; a lot of it is as Shantanu just said this larger multiyear transactions as well. And like I said, you do see it in unbilled and deferred.","Brent Thill","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks very much. And I will also echo my congratulations on a nice Q3. I want to revisit the first question that was asked, maybe to ask a little bit differently. Trying to resolve the Digital Media ARR outlook for next quarter going up with revenue coming down and logically there is only two ways that make sense to me to get there either your linearity assumptions changed and you thought you could achieve greater ARR in Q3 or at more earlier within Q4 or the mix of subscription versus product change which you already spoke to. And if that\u2019s the case, how can you forecast that or maybe ask differently what\u2019s changed in a way that you\u2019re offering those three products in Q4 that gives you the visibility to know that the take rate will be more subscription versus product?","Shantanu Narayen","That\u2019s a good question Brad and what is really happening in the imaging business in particular is as you know that traditional Q4 cycle when we had predicted what the revenue would be viewed have a version of Photoshop Elements that was released in every Q4, which was always perpetual revenue. We have also had Lightroom that is offered in both perpetual and now as part of the Creative Cloud photography offer, a subscription offering. And as we see both of those migrate through the Creative Cloud photography offer that is giving us visibility into the fact that our customers are increasingly choosing the subscription offering rather than the perpetual offering. So think of it as Photoshop Elements not having the normal change or increment that we normally see in Q4 and continue to see Lightroom move towards the subscription rather than the perpetual is resulting in that revenue. And again as Mark said, if you think about it as every $10 million is leading to -- in ARR is leading to $30 million or so in revenue. And if you look at what we had given as our Q4 targets, at the high end of the range approximately half of that is probably in Digital Media and it's clearly shown as a greater portion of that going through ARR. So hopefully that helps.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks for taking my question Shantanu. It\u2019s helpful. And I will save my others for a couple of weeks when I see you all at MAX.","Mark Garrett","Okay.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks guys. I apologize I got kicked off the call, so it may have been asked, but what\u2019s causing the longer implementation time that you mentioned in your prepared remarks and also geographically where are you seeing the best strength in terms of the Creative Cloud net adds?","Shantanu Narayen","The Creative Cloud Net adds, Sterling continue to be strong everywhere. One of the things I talked about earlier was that Japan which we\u2019ve had a lag relative to the adoption of Creative Cloud in the U.S is now showing good strength. We had the CS6 sold in Japan later than we had in any another country and now that\u2019s CS6 base, whether it's in Japan or Germany, other countries, we\u2019re certainly seeing migration of that into the Creative Cloud, which all goes well for continued strength of Creative Cloud across the globe. And with respect to the implementation cycles, what I had mentioned was that as we move from selling to practitioners single solutions to selling entire Marketing Cloud and multiple solutions higher up in the chain, what\u2019s still happening is the implementation of the solutions happen sequentially and therefore as soon as the solution goes live we start to recognize it. So they standardize on the Adobe product which results in the bookings and the unbilled backlog, but the implementation because it is multiple solutions takes a little longer than single solution.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi, thanks. Shantanu, I look at the full suite adds and its coming a little to your growth is continuing to slowdown there a bit. And we also noticed that you\u2019re being a lot less aggressive with promotion in -- especially this year overall, but even into the August quarter where we\u2019re tracking it. And I\u2019m wondering how you\u2019re thinking about the mechanisms to continue to convert full suite customers over. I mean it would feel like you\u2019re feeling pretty good about it, because you\u2019re not being as promotional, but we\u2019re seeing the gross add as we calculate it on the full suite adds decelerating a bit more from where they were in the first half of your fiscal year?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, I think Walter we had a good Creative Cloud subs add across virtually every single offering that we had. Team had actually a very strong quarter and globally we continue to feel strong about the migration capabilities of moving Creative Cloud -- Creative Suite customers to Creative Cloud. You\u2019re also right in that, we had fewer promotions in the quarter which again I think reflects both the distinction now that we\u2019ve drawn between Creative Cloud and the old Creative Suite products, and the fact that in Q4 we continue to expect to see strength. And we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about this at MAX as well Walter relative to all of the new stuff that\u2019s coming and how we see the business unfold in 2016 and beyond.","Walter Pritchard","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merril Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I apologize for the background noise here. Mark, if you could just parse for us the new guidance maybe take the mid-point of your revenue versus where Wall Street had been and break it down into how much of the delta is coming from the Digital Marketing business rev rec changes vis-\u00e0-vis the Digital Media that will be helpful. And also as it pertains to Digital Marketing are we completely done with this, because I remember you\u2019re saying that about 70% of the business was booked at subscription not too long ago, but basically you commented that you expect that number could be higher, and so effectively are you going to be completely done and devoid of surprises in the Digital Marketing subscriptions? Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Hi, Kash, it\u2019s about half and half in terms of the new guidance to the old guidance from a revenue perspective. So about half of it is Digital Media driven which is now showing up in ARR and about half of it is Digital Marketing driven which is showing up in deferred and un-built backlog. So it\u2019s roughly half and half. On the mix, yes you\u2019re right, we said it was moving towards 70-30 or even 80-20 but if you do the math that\u2019s, its still a lot of dollars of perpetual revenue in any given quarter. And so, there is going to be some variability based on customer preference as we said and we closed some of it in Q3 instead of Q4 but there\u2019s still going to be some variability in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s why we gave you a range. At the high end of that range right at that $400 million which is the high end of the range, we would still hit the 24% year-over-year growth that we said we would go in Digital Marketing for the second half.","Kash Rangan","Got it. I think its actually a good thing and I completely agree with you guys that you\u2019re designing the solutions such way to assume the [indiscernible] of revenue ratably, but as a quick [indiscernible] just so investments are offered that the data, is there a way which we can say that you expected your off balance sheet, on balance sheet backlog that for revenue to be X, but as a result of the shift you expect it to be Y at the end of this year so we can see that as supposed to the Digital Media business where you clearly pointed out that ARR increase can be match fit with a corresponding 150 million [ph] or whatever, is there something like that that we can offer to investors as to what to look for if you report the end year results as far as backlog for digital markets is concerned? Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Yes. On the Digital Media side there is, because we originally guided to $2.9 billion and ARR is now going to be $2.95 billion. So there is a lot of increase to ARR in the Digital Media side, so you can clearly show that. On the Digital Marketing side granted it\u2019s a little bit harder. We don\u2019t guide on deferred revenue, we don\u2019t guide on build backlog. I will tell you though, its growing faster, both of those are growing faster than our own expectation, that\u2019s about all I could give you right now.","Shantanu Narayen","And Kash, maybe I\u2019ll just repeat again what Mark said, which was in Q3 we definitely saw strength in the perpetual licensing which was reflected in the 21%. We had strong bookings in Q3, we continue to see the pipeline is really strong for Q4 and so we expect a strong finish. And for Q4 the high end of the range, it\u2019s really identical to, the targets that we provided at the end of the Q2 call with respect to what kind of revenue achievement we expect for the second half of fiscal \u201815. So I think the fact that we continue to reiterate 30% bookings and now this is in, even despite the change in currency. So I think those are some of the factors which give us continued confidence in the momentum of the Digital Marketing business.","Kash Rangan","Nice work gentlemen. Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much. So drilling a little more on the, Adobe has moved to the Cloud, what's driving that adoption now, is it pricing, is it functionality or how should we think about what the key drivers, and then I have a quick follow-up?","Shantanu Narayen","Mark, I think in the highest sense it\u2019s the Photoshop brand and the Photoshop name and the fact that the Creative Cloud innovation pace is happening at a much faster pace than it is with traditional 12 month Photoshop element cycle, Photoshop elements cycles. The other thing that I think we are starting to see, maybe I can touch on this a little bit more, is that the mobile apps. What we\u2019re seeing with usage of mobile across imaging, this is light-room mobile as well as what you can do on smartphones. I mean we have 10s of millions of downloads of our mobile applications. And in the imaging when we look at usage data, the usage data and imaging across multiple devices which we would argue will lead to much higher retention is also fairly high. So I think the elements move is largely due to the attractiveness of the element -- the offer of both light-room and Photoshop as well as the fact that it\u2019s mobile enabled.","Mark Moerdler","Okay. And a quick follow-up, how should we think about, I know you said that Adobe stock is strong in terms of adoption. Can you give us a little more color of how that is going? Were you expecting it to, how we should think about stock having an impact?","Shantanu Narayen","Well it\u2019s early. I think you when Mark had given us targets for how much revenue we expect to see added when we had talked about the revenue addition for Fotolia versus the revenue reduction at that point for currency. I would say we\u2019re on track with that business, it\u2019s early. We\u2019re seeing people both add to and existing Creative Cloud subscription with stock and we are starting to see people adopt the new subscription offers that have the Creative Cloud complete plus stock. So I realize that\u2019s not quantifying it yet for you, but relative to any of the targets that we\u2019ve provided earlier we\u2019re on track.","Mark Moerdler","Okay. One other quick question, what's the percentage of subs with annual contracts, do we know that?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, we do Mark. Its about 97% annual and 3% month-to-month.","Mark Moerdler","Perfect. Thank you, and it was a nice quarter. Thank you very much.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much, and I\u2019ll eco my congrats on the quarter. One of the things that had been talked a whole lot since you guys have been switching over to some of the element of [indiscernible] some of the software that was perhaps not obtained legally historically, and I\u2019m kind of curios just that you, I see a little bit more traction especially in our sort of international markets with the suite. If you feel like you\u2019re recapturing maybe [indiscernible] casual pirating Cloud especially around that Hobbyist level. I was just kind of curious on your thoughts there. And then just a really quick one in certain, all that related on the marketing side, just the difference in competition as you get into these multi-year deals, multi-product multi-year deals? That\u2019s it. Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, to answer both your questions, the first thing I would say is relative to the new seat adoption that we\u2019re seeing, the new seat adoption is definitely being driven both by creators who are entering the market as well as casual pirates who existed for whom the lower price of entry is far more attractive way to have legal software than not. There\u2019s no question about that, we hear that anecdotally all the time that people are pleased with the fact that they can have legitimate software. As we\u2019re delivering more Cloud based services, as you know the only way to use the mobile apps and share content between the mobile apps as well as our Creative Cloud, is by having a subscription. So I think that\u2019s also as we see more creative sync and creative profile being used, that\u2019s certainly, driving that. So I think we feel good about that. With respect to your second question on completion. I think our differentiator continues to be honestly the content and data part, and there\u2019s nobody that comes at it with respect to having the kind of content infrastructure that we have to enable them to re-platform their websites which is a massive trend as well as the fact that we have the analytics. We had this announcement recently also about what we\u2019re doing with respect to a programmatic advertising platform that also leverages the fact that we have analytics. So I think the unique differentiation was analytics in the past. It continues to be audience manager right now, because for the first time people can have the same audience, the same segment, the same campaign, the same content, the same assets used across all of our marketing solutions. With respect to external competition, I think we still see a number of point product vendors that are in that market place and I think you\u2019re seeing the larger ISVs as well start to identify marketing as one of the large growth opportunities for them and Oracle is the company that\u2019s probably done a lot of acquisitions in that space. But we like our differentiation and we continue to execute on it.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Weiss","I just want to thank you guys for taking the question and congrats on a very nice quarter. Maybe just to carry on the theme of the marketing environment, the competitive environment, one of the things a lot of us have been looking for in this space for quite sometime is that sort of consolidation of what has been a very fragmented market. Where do you think we are in that progress of the marketing cost ever being more willing to consolidate multiple solutions into one suite just from a prior market perspective? And then how do you sort of help to push that along?","Shantanu Narayen","I think Keith, the thing that I hear a lot when I talk to customers and I spend a lot of time with customers is, this notion of digital transformation and digital disruption at the C-suite is front and center across every single industry. Without a doubt that is leading to people looking at larger systems and saying, how do we transform our business to drive more direct relationship with customers and build a customer centric company. So I think every C-suite that I\u2019m talking whether you\u2019re in retail, whether you\u2019re in financial services that\u2019s a thing that\u2019s leading to understanding which companies, which vendors have a larger offering in that particular space. I think as they think through that, they\u2019re also having to reorganize the marketing function, because search versus commerce, versus revenue has traditionally been in different places. So I think you\u2019re see that play out over the next year, couple of years, but I think you are seeing more of them recognize that having a unified platform is the way to go. So we still sell to practitioners and we still have to make sure we\u2019re best of breed in each of the individual solutions, but I would say increasingly our deals especially the new customer acquisition is a larger deal that\u2019s being sold higher in the chain.","Keith Weiss","Okay. And can I just stick one last one, just on the broader environment there\u2019s been a lot of obviously market turmoil particularly around emerging markets. How have you seen overall demand trends particularly internationally sustain throughout the quarter?","Shantanu Narayen","Well maybe this is one of the benefits of not having too much of emerging markets, business or presence in the creative space that it\u2019s not really impacting us. So we continue to see strength across most international markets. And as you know in Digital Marketing that\u2019s primarily the UK, Germany, Japan and Australia where we have significant presence and some presence in other places. But I think as we said on the prepared remarks, the interest in the solutions when we were in Singapore or when you\u2019re in Sydney or now in Tokyo, all of these symposia being held to sold out audiences. So the awareness and the understanding of this as one of those important technologies is only growing.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Susquehanna International Group. Your line is open.","Derrick Wood","Thanks. Mark, given the accelerated mix shift and the model on the revenue side, does that impact the framework you\u2019ve given for 2016 expectations on revenue and EPS or maybe do we need to think about trends in gross margins in any different way?","Mark Garrett","I don\u2019t know if they need to think about trends in gross margins in any different way. As it relates to \u201916, we don\u2019t typically comment on next year until we get to the Q4 call. So I can't really given you any insights into \u201916, but it shouldn\u2019t have any significant movement in gross margins. Because on the creative side, it\u2019s not a fully hosted offering, it\u2019s got Cloud componentry to it, but it\u2019s not a huge Cloud component.","Derrick Wood","Okay. And then Shantanu, I\u2019d be curious to hear how you ranked the impact for some of your ARPU enhancing services on the creative platform. You\u2019ve got [indiscernible] with social, a talent search, you\u2019ve got Fotolio with stock content, you\u2019ve got things like video and mobile apps. Anyway you could just couch the relative impact on driving additional ARR and how you see that ramping in the upcoming quarters?","Shantanu Narayen","I think with respect to new services that have the largest potential upside, we continue to think that Adobe stock is what drives upside in terms of ARR. Usage of Behance is driving higher retention. So the way we look at what's happening with Behance is being part of the community because, that\u2019s included for the most part. There are some value added services as you point out, but for the most part Behance is driving greater retention. And video is driving more usage from single app to the CC complete. So I think we look at each of the different ones as driving either an increase in ARPU as you pointed out or as driving greater retention both of which from our point of view are useful, because as you know as people move off of any promotional pricing retention is something that\u2019s key to us and adding increased value is important in that respect.","Derrick Wood","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Brendan Barnicle","Thanks so much. Shantanu, I wanted to follow-up on Keith\u2019s question about the Marketing Cloud and you alluded to uncertainty that C-suite tab and they\u2019re figuring what to do with their marketing strategy. Is that the biggest obstacle that you run into in terms of closing Marketing Clouds, that folks are still trying to figure out what tools to work with or is this something else that\u2019s holding up deals?","Shantanu Narayen","No, I actually continue to feel like the awareness and the importance of that deal is actually playing to our favor rather than the other way around and that\u2019s why we continue to see strong bookings and it\u2019s leading to larger deal sizes rather than then other way around. So from our point of view, we have the most comprehensive offering. We\u2019re the leader in that particular category and so those deals actually play to Adobe\u2019s favor.","Brendan Barnicle","Great. And then, Mark do you have a percentage number for us in terms of total end customers to in subscription not net news but folks who are brand new to you. Do you have that kind of breakdown?","Mark Garrett","We\u2019ve been consistently saying that it\u2019s over 20% and that\u2019s still holding true.","Brendan Barnicle","Great. Thank you guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. I\u2019d like to ask first about the transition you\u2019re seeing now in Document Cloud and then just follow-up on adobe.com. So perhaps, Shantanu you could talk about the Document Cloud transition within volume terms. Two quarters ago, you updated us by noting that the active base, you calculated for Acrobat was something more than $30 million. We know historically that the average new unit volume for Acrobat were somewhere in that mid-single digit unit [indiscernible] when it was packaged software. So if we look out over the next number of years, how you\u2019re thinking about converting that large phase, most of which was done on the LA's over to subscription. And given what you\u2019re seeing now are anymore client [indiscernible] on perpetuals that you\u2019ve been doing or collecting to do for Acrobat?","Shantanu Narayen","I think we\u2019ve always stated Jay that we think that the Document Cloud transition will be different from the Creative Cloud transition, in that it will be important for us to continue to offer the same perpetual version for a while. What we are seeing is on adobe.com the vast, vast majority of people who are buying Acrobat DC right now are buying the subscription option. And so I think as we have previously indicated, I think with respect to the Acrobat transition, we expect to continue to see revenue relatively stable but you will see an acceleration in the Document Cloud ARR that\u2019s reflected, that\u2019s showing how the transitioning is happening. And with respect to the $30 million number that you said, that was the number that we eluded to in terms of what number of Acrobat seats we have sold in the history of Acrobat. And so, again I think we\u2019re pleased with what we see on the Document Cloud but it has slightly different characteristics than what we\u2019re seeing with the Creative Cloud.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","All right. As a follow-up on adobe.com, I would have to think that at this point the business flowing through adobe.com is larger that your revenues than was the case prior to the model change if you go back a number of years, adobe.com was probably doing roughly lets say about $0.5 billion give or take, it depends on the year of course, but now I would think given the scale of Creative Cloud and the other businesses that its substantially larger that it might have been historically; so the question is, could you relate Mark, do you presume scaling up significantly adobe.com for the profitability of the company, is there a substantial effect on your operating income by having so much more business going through adobe.com now than historically most case.","Mark Garrett","Yes, without a doubt Jay, we\u2019re doing more and more business on adobe.com much, much more than we did before the transition by far more than we did before the transition and yes, it is going to be more profitable than going through even our own direct sales force or the channel. So to the extent that we can drive more and more business there, it does improve us from a profitability perspective. I can't give you a number, but it definitely is more profitable for us.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you.","Mike Saviage","Operator, we\u2019re coming up in the top of the hour. Lets do two more questions, please.","Operator","Thank you. Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open for questions.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on Adobe stop for a second. I was just wondering if you can share with us, where you seen the best opportunity for cross sell and also, if you have a sense of when you look out for the potential of the attachment here in install base, kind of how are you framing that opportunity?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Heather, I think what we\u2019ve said in the past is approximately 85% and greater of that is of the buyers as well as the sellers are using Adobe products. And when you think about the size of that market which is in the multiple billion that represents an opportunity for us to add value to the customers. In terms of what we\u2019ve done Heather for the integration, as you know within Photoshop and all of our products, you now have the ability to both put something up on the market place to sell as well as you have the ability to search for something when you\u2019re starting with a blank canvas and you want to get a creative idea or inspiration to get something going. So integrating it into the workflow makes a lot of sense. And what we\u2019re also offering right now is new subscriptions which say if you are getting a subscription where you know what kind of demand you have for stock, you can buy all of the complete applications in addition to the stock. So I think the value within the workflow is well understood, both the supply and demand participate with us. I think two things maybe underappreciated as we are building this business. The first is the number of people who are running campaigns and when you\u2019re running a campaign using our Marketing Cloud technology being able to use this stock to also stock your campaign progress and time that in we showed brief sneak of that. We think that, that\u2019s an opportunity for us to drive it and second is, within the enterprise. So as we\u2019re selling enterprise ETLAs, there isn\u2019t an enterprise in the world that doesn\u2019t have a marketing department that\u2019s procuring stock. And so if we can demonstrate the value of how an enterprise ETLA for the creative products can include stock as part of that, we think that has value as well.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Philip Winslow","Hi, guys. Thanks guys for taking my question. Most of my questions have been answered. But I wanted to actually double click on something you talked about earlier, the TAM expansion on the creative side. Obviously you had great user count growth in particular the past couple of quarters and you\u2019ve done a great job of framing the Cloud, the Creative Cloud transition looking to call it your core users, but if you think about net TAM expansion in incremental users, what if you could just help us kind of with the math about how you think about these new sort of lower price products expanding the TAM, just any sort of guide post there would be really helpful?","Mark Garrett","Yes, Phil I think we\u2019ll definitely share more of that at MAX and so that\u2019s a good segue to match because sharing the numbers for example of how many people have bought our consumer photography offerings in the past that we did not include as part of the TAM or the market, that\u2019s certainly expansion capabilities that are now available for us. As we\u2019re getting more information on piracy and understanding what kind of activations we may have seen, giving you a little bit more color on that with respect to the TAM I think is another way for us to expand. So we\u2019re looking forward to MAX, we will share with you more information on TAMs at MAX and hopefully give you insight into in addition to the core migration of the Creative Suite customer to create a Cloud. How this market expansion with respect to targeting new users as well as users who traditionally may have used other products or value expansion which is how we can sell new services like talent or like Adobe stock into that existing base help us expand our TAM. So I think we\u2019ll be certainly sharing more information with you on that. MAX is coming up in a few weeks, so we look forward to seeing you as well as others at MAX. And let me just end by thanking you for joining us again on the call today. From my point of view, we had a strong quarter, the underlying trends in our business in both Digital Media and Digital Marketing continue to be strong. And I look at it and say, whether it\u2019s a student retouching a photo on their tablet, a director making a latest block buster film or what you see as consumer brand publishing their marketing content across the web and mobile. It\u2019s clear that Adobe technology is at the heart of the world\u2019s best experiences and we look forward to increasing that.

We continue to execute well against our strategy with faster-than-expected adoption of Creative Cloud in our Digital Media business and strong momentum and growth in our Digital Marketing business.","In Digital Media, we continue to make great progress reimagining our Creative and Document Services offerings as cloud services. This enables us to innovate at a more rapid pace, attract new customers to our platforms and build predictable recurring revenue streams. As of the end of Q3, Creative Cloud adoption grew to over 1 million paid subscriptions, and we have millions more in the pipeline who are trying out the service. As a result of the strong subscription uptake and increased enterprise adoption, total Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew to $655 million.","Individual, team and enterprise customers are realizing the advantages of Creative Cloud. Individuals are receiving a constant stream of innovation at an affordable price. Teams are benefiting from being on the same version and the ability to seamlessly share files, fonts and preferences. Enterprises are increasing their adoption due to simplified licensing models and integration with Adobe Marketing Cloud. Individual, team and enterprise term-based licensing all had strong results in Q3.","Recent examples of Creative Cloud innovation include significant updates to our video tools, as well as the release of Adobe Anywhere, a solution that helps large video production teams collaborate smoothly and securely. We announced Adobe Generator, new imaging technology that enables customers to utilize Photoshop for web and mobile app development more quickly and easily.","To facilitate design on tablets, we announced today we will partner with Adonit to produce 2 new devices. One is Project Mighty, a cloud-connected pen; and the other is Project Napoleon, a digital ruler. Our goal is to enable these 2 new devices to work with tablet apps like Adobe Ideas and Photoshop Touch and ensure connectivity with Creative Cloud files.","We continue to expand our Creative Cloud offerings to migrate existing customers and acquire new users. We should start to see the benefit of adding single app subscriptions to our team offering and a new subscription offer for photographers, which combines Photoshop and Lightroom to address requests from the photography community.","We drove stronger-than-expected performance with large Creative customers through our enterprise term license agreements, or ETLAs, in Q3. Some customers that we believe would have adopted the team offering are instead choosing ETLAs. Across our Creative business, the overwhelming majority of customers are moving away from perpetual licenses towards term-based licenses, demonstrating acceptance of the new offering. As a result of this success, we will exit fiscal 2013 with more ARR and less reported revenue than we outlined at the outset of the year.","We continue to build momentum with our digital publishing business, with more than 120 million digital editions delivered to consumers through app stores. Yesterday, we announced new magazine industry-standard audience metrics are available through Digital Publishing Suite's analytics, filling a critical gap in the measurement and reporting of audience readership across digital magazines. We continue to grow corporate adoption of DPS in areas like catalog, company magazine, sales enablement and brochure publishing, with brands like Airbus, Gap, JPMorgan Private Bank and Lowes now engaging their customers through these tablet apps.","In our Document Services businesses, Acrobat continued to perform well, with online services continuing their strong momentum. We now have surpassed 1.3 million Document Services subscriptions.","In Digital Marketing, Adobe is extending its leadership position. We achieved 28% year-over-year growth in Q3 with Adobe Marketing Cloud and are on a run rate exceeding $1 billion in annual revenue. We're driving adoption of multiple solutions, which is increasing the value and size of customer bookings.","Building upon our already comprehensive portfolio of solutions, in July, we completed the acquisition of Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign management technology based in Paris. Neolane integrates online and offline marketing data from across an enterprise, performing robust audience segmentation and delivering marketing messages across channels including web, email, social, mobile, call center, direct mail and point of sale.","This enables marketers to deliver consistent customer experiences, personalized campaigns and increased ROI. Neolane becomes Adobe Campaign and will be integrated into the Adobe Marketing Cloud as our sixth solution, joining Adobe Analytics, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Media Optimizer, Adobe Social and Adobe Target.","Adobe Experience Manager had strong performance in Q3. In July, we rolled out Adobe Social 3.0, featuring integration with Flickr, Foursquare, Instagram and LinkedIn. Last week, we announced a major update to Adobe Target with a completely redesigned touch-based interface that guides users through testing digital offers and personalizing web content for specific audiences. In addition to driving innovation within each solution, we are focusing on integration across Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions.","Adobe is increasingly being identified as the digital marketing leader among industry analysts. Coming on the heels of strong recognition in Forrester's Web Content Management Wave in Q2, we were identified as the leader in Gartner's Web Content Management Magic Quadrant and Forrester's Data Management Platforms Wave. This drives awareness among customers, especially in web content management, an area that has become mission critical to companies that need to re-platform their online businesses for the next generation of mobile, social media and apps.","No other company has an end-to-end value proposition like ours, with Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud addressing the entire life cycle of content. From creators to marketers and from ad agencies to media companies, we provide a compelling value proposition as companies transform their businesses to digital.","In summary, we demonstrated strong performance in Q3. We achieved significant milestones in both Digital Media and Digital Marketing. Based on year-to-date results, we're on track to exceed our fiscal 2013 targets of $800 million in Digital Media annualized recurring revenue and greater than 20% revenue growth with Adobe Marketing Cloud.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mark for a discussion of Q3 financial results.","Mark S. Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, Adobe achieved revenue of $995 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.16. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.32. Revenue and earnings were within our targeted ranges. Our acquisition of Neolane during the quarter contributed approximately $6 million in revenue to our Q3 results, and the impact from the transaction on earnings was less than $0.01.","We're pleased with our results in Q3. As a result of overachievement in subscriptions and ETLAs, which is reflected in higher ARR, revenue and earnings per share were below the midpoints of our targeted ranges. Highlights in the quarter included strong Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth, accelerating past 1 million individual and team subscriptions with Creative Cloud and driving better-than-expected ETLA adoption with Creative and Acrobat customers.","Success in Q3 with subscriptions and ETLAs drove significant upside in ARR. We exited Q3 with approximately $655 million in Digital Media ARR, up from $440 million exiting Q2. Combined with other Adobe businesses where revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, we exited the quarter with 41% of our Q3 revenue as recurring, up from 35% exiting Q2. When we started this journey to transform our business model in late 2011, we anticipated hitting 40% of our business being recurring by the end of fiscal 2014, and we've already surpassed that mark as of the end of Q3 fiscal 2013.","In Digital Media, we achieved reported revenue of $637 million. This segment has 2 major components of revenue: our Creative family of products and our Document Services products.","In our Creative business, customer adoption of Creative Cloud accelerated. We exited Q3 with 1,031,000 paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, an increase of 331,000 in the quarter. Adoption of team subscriptions was strong, and we closed more ETLA contracts with enterprise customers in Q3 than the sum of those closed in Q1 and Q2. Combined, our success with subscription and ETLA adoption helped to drive Creative ARR to a total of $546 million exiting Q3, an increase of $191 million quarter-over-quarter.","Our strategic goal is to accelerate adoption of Creative Cloud, and we are focusing all of our innovation there. We have added new capabilities to both the individual and team offerings and continue to offer a variety of targeted promotions to drive awareness, consideration and purchase. This strategy is working. Overall monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, remained consistent with prior quarters due to success of the team product and strong retention among individual customers renewing at full price as their introductory pricing expired.","As of the end of Q3, 95% of Creative Cloud subscriptions are annual plans versus month-to-month and 81% are for the full Creative Cloud versus point products. Adobe.com remains the preferred way for our customers to engage with us when subscribing, although we've seen solid growth in the channel business with the team offering.","In Document Services, we achieved revenue of $183 million in Q3. Our success in this category is being driven by continued adoption of Acrobat, Acrobat ETLAs, Acrobat cloud services and our EchoSign e-signing contract solution. Document Services' ARR grew from $84 million exiting Q2 to $109 million exiting Q3.","In our Digital Marketing segment, there are 2 components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and in Q3, we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $255 million, representing year-over-year growth of 28%. Excluding the $6 million of Neolane revenue, year-over-year growth was 25%. Mobile device use continues to be a driver in our Digital Marketing business. Mobile transactions increased to 28%, up from 26% last quarter.","Our focus on 5 solutions in Digital Marketing with streamlined pricing is resonating with customers and increasing our ability to create larger engagements with them. Our growth is driven through new customer acquisition as well as increased annualized revenue per customer. The addition of Neolane represents our sixth solution and enhances our ability to drive larger customer engagements.","The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses. LiveCycle and Connect contributed $57 million in Q3 revenue, which was consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing was down quarter-over-quarter as expected. This was driven primarily by an increase in ETLA adoption for some of the products in this segment, with revenue being recognized over time as opposed to upfront. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies.","From a currency perspective, quarter-over-quarter FX rate changes had a $2.6 million negative impact on reported revenue. Hedging gains contributed $10.5 million to revenue in Q3 FY '13 versus $15.3 million in Q2 FY '13. Thus, the net sequential quarterly currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $7.4 million.","Year-over-year, FX rate changes had an $18 million negative impact on reported revenue. Comparing the $10.5 million in Q3 FY '13 hedging gains to the $7.7 million of hedging gains in Q3 FY '12, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $15.2 million.","In Q3, Adobe's effective tax rate was 11% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain income tax examinations.","Employees at the end of Q3 totaled 12,035 versus 11,413 at the end of last quarter. The majority of the increase in headcount was due to the acquisition of Neolane. Our trade DSO was 48 days, which compares to 48 days in the year-ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. Ending deferred revenue in Q3 was a record $734 million.","During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $216 million. Cash flow was lower than typical, primarily due to an income tax payment and the timing of enterprise billings. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.16 billion compared to $3.87 billion at the end of Q2. The sequential decline was due to our acquisition of Neolane during the quarter and stock repurchases. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 7 million shares at a total cost of $326 million.","Now I will discuss our targets for Q4. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we are targeting a revenue range of $1 billion to $1,050,000,000. This range includes an estimated $20 million of revenue from Neolane during the quarter. We expect total Digital Media ARR to be approximately $875 million exiting Q4, exceeding our prior FY '13 target of $800 million. This is based on adding slightly more Creative Cloud paid subscriptions than was achieved in Q3 and continued strength with ETLA adoption.","Assuming the midpoint of our targeted Q4 revenue range, we expect Digital Media revenue to be down sequentially. In our Digital Marketing segment, we expect Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 35%. We expect LiveCycle and Connect revenue to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, and we expect Print and Publishing to decline slightly on a sequential basis.","We are targeting our Q4 share count to be 511 million to 513 million shares. We are targeting net nonoperating expense to be between $17 million and $19 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of 21% in Q4 on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.09 to $0.15 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.28 to $0.34.","We will provide FY '14 targets on our December earnings call, but we wanted to provide preliminary observations for next year as we enter Q4. Digital Marketing remains an explosive growth category, and we will continue to target strong revenue and bookings growth. In Digital Media, the transition to Creative Cloud is happening sooner than expected. While our multi-year targets remain unchanged, we expect increased Creative ARR in FY '14, with reduced perpetual revenue relative to what we communicated at MAX and May.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, Mark.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark, I'm wondering if -- just 2 questions about subscribers. I don't have access to the presentation here, but I didn't hear you update your goals for fiscal '15 around the number of subscribers, which I believe before was 4 million. And then secondarily, we're used to seeing an uptick from Q3 to Q4 in your perpetual business when it was that model exclusively. And I think you noted in the past, when you were setting expectations for this year, that you would expect to see a bump from Q3 to Q4 in terms of that, and now you're saying sort of relatively flat. And I'm wondering, did you sort of pull forward some of that demand that you expected incrementally in Q4? Or what else would account for a much more level sequential increase?","Mark S. Garrett","Sure, Walter. So a couple of things. On the Q3 to Q4 uptick for seasonality, to be honest with you, as we moved more and more to this ratable model through ETLAs and subscribers, that seasonality starts to get muted. And I think that's what you're seeing in our guidance. There's a little bit in there for digital marketing. Obviously, there'll be a bump in that business, but that's less seasonal. That's a SaaS-based model. But the typical seasonality, we're just not going to see like we used to in the perpetual business, especially as more and more people are moving off of perpetual on to the subscription model. In terms of FY '15, let me back up a minute and talk about '14 a little more, which will then kind of give you some color into '15 as well. As we said on the call, we've had a really successful move to subscriptions and ETLAs. And as Shantanu and I both articulated, customers are moving even sooner than we had anticipated. We've had success in the individual and team and the ETLAs. And as a result of that, we do see it as mix shift to greater ARR and less perpetual revenue. So what you see in Q3 and Q4 of this year is going to be representative of what you're going to see through the beginning of 2014. You're going to see a more rapid subscription and ETLA adoption. So there's going to be a quicker decline in reported perpetual revenue and then a steeper return in reported revenue as we ramp up the subscribers. We expected the Creative product family revenue is going to begin to increase sequentially by the middle of next year. And the health of the business through this transition, as we've said for a while now, is best measured by ARR. To your point on the FY '15 targets, our long-term targets are unchanged. For Creative, we still believe we'll hit 4 million subs by the end of 2015. We still believe we'll grow reported revenue on a CAGR of over 15% from '14 to '16. We still believe total Adobe revenue and earnings growth rose in '14 and beyond. So none of those long-term metrics have changed. Things are just happening faster, which is exactly what we want. The other thing to keep in mind on that 4 million target, as Shantanu alluded to the fact that some of the team subscribers are moving to ETLAs, and as a result of that, they don't show up in the subscriber count that we publish. So the 4 million would be bigger were it not for the fact that some team people are now moving to ETLAs, but we still are confident in the 4 million.","Shantanu Narayen","And just Walter, maybe a little bit more color on Q3 to Q4 transition. We do see strength in the pipeline as it relates to both Digital Marketing as well as enterprise ETLAs, which is why we've said Digital Marketing, we expect to grow 35% at the midpoint, and ETLAs also is a very healthy pipeline.","Operator","Your next question is from Peter Goldmacher with Cowen.","Peter L. Goldmacher - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to ask you a question on the competitive environment in the marketing cloud. Specifically, salesforce.com is making a lot of noise with the ExactTarget acquisition. Would love to hear your perspective on it, and how you guys intend to compete against it and what you think your competitive advantages are.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So Peter, I think you saw significant strength in our offering. There are multiple, I think, key differentiators as it relates to our solution, the first of which is both our data and our analytics platform have just significant market share. As I mentioned, the Adobe Experience Manager product is doing exceedingly well. Adobe Analytics continues to do well. And then when you add out all of the other solutions that we talked about, we do believe we have the most comprehensive offering in the market. As it relates specifically to email marketing, we think the bigger opportunity honestly is in multichannel campaign marketing. And again, there, with the acquisition of Neolane, we believe we have the strongest offering in the market. When you think about what people want, everybody is an individual. And at the end of the day, you want a campaign targeted at an individual, not just through email but also through all of the other channels that we talked about, including the web. So expect to continue to see us innovate in each of the solutions independently and across solutions. But we're really pretty confident that we'll continue to have the best offering in the market, and we're going to focus on it.","Operator","Your next question is from Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Shantanu, I just wanted to follow up on a comment that you made during your prepared remarks that you saw some customers you thought would be team users actually choosing ETLAs. What's sort of the dynamic driving that? And do you think that given that the 4 million target referenced earlier was a team plus individual piece, if ETLAs ends up being a bigger piece than -- of the mix than you previously thought, does that change your thinking around where that sub count number can go over time?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Jennifer, what we had originally given on our numbers was based on the experience that we had with our perpetual offerings where individuals would buy shrink-wrapped software either through the channel or directly on Adobe.com. And enterprises would transact business with us through a variety of licensing mechanisms that we had: transaction licensing, which wasn't a commitment to buy further products from Adobe; or contractual licensing, which was a commitment to buy further products from Adobe. And we certainly had our internal estimates of -- for that licensing, whether people would move to the team option and just transact business with us on the website, or whether they would choose to actually have a contract with us through the enterprise term license agreement. What we are seeing is as a result of the comprehensive offering that we have for the Creative Cloud within enterprises and the integration with things that we have like digital asset management as well as the marketing cloud, the enterprise customers are actually choosing to transact business with us through the enterprise term license agreement, which is why both Mark and I wanted to make sure you all understood that the annualized recurring revenue, given it contains both the subscription performance as well as the ETLAs, is really a good proxy for the business. We expect to continue to see strength in individual, team as well as in enterprise, and that's why we continue to be confident of our long-term goals. But as Mark said, expect to continue to see that reflected in ARR as well.","Mark S. Garrett","And just to add on to that one last time, my point was we're not raising the 4 million. We're very confident in the 4 million. We're not raising it. It's just a little too early to do that. Plus, we have this effect of team moving over to ETLA in some cases.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And maybe just one quick follow-up around the ETLA point. As you think about the Document Services business, and the ARR component there is also getting to be fairly large and a lot of that is tied to customers wanting more unified ETLAs. Is there a scenario where we could see Document Services go fully subscription at some point in time? How do you think about that business transitioning?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, today in Document Services, we actually have 3 different offers. We do offer customers the ability to have perpetual, and we continue to believe that, that will have a longer tail than in the Creative business because of the variety of customers. We do offer Document Services customers the ability to both get an ETLA, and we actually did see strength in the ETLA business for Document Services as well in the quarter. Having an aligned offering between Acrobat and Creative is actually useful for our sales force as they go into an enterprise because they can sell consistent ETLA across both. And just to clarify, an ETLA is a very standard deal for all of the deals that we're talking about. It's a 3-year deal, and we recognize revenue ratably across all of the 3 years. So what you're seeing in the annualized recurring revenue does not reflect the entire transaction value that we're actually getting from the customers. But I think to answer your question, we will continue to have Document Services in the current model, perpetual model for a longer period.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Shantanu, on the marketing cloud, you're seeing acceleration in that business even when you strip out Neolane. And I'm just curious if you could just help walk through what -- why that acceleration just on a pure organic basis, and I had a quick follow-up for Mark.","Shantanu Narayen","I'd attribute it, Brent, to a couple of issues. The first issue is the awareness of our solution is certainly increasing. I think as the adoption of our various solutions is taking hold, we're certainly upselling to our customers. So we look at both new customer acquisition as well as within an existing customer, are we selling them increased solutions, and both of those are working. And I would say the comprehensiveness of our solution, I think we've done a good job as a team of adding to data and Analytics and Target and Social. And I think Adobe Campaign, also there's a lot of interest. And we're just executing. We're executing against both the platform that we're delivering to our customers, which is resonating with them, and we're executing on the field and marketing side.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And for Mark, just -- you mentioned you've surpassed the milestone on the recurring revenue, over 40% now. Is there a sense -- obviously, the majority of the business is going to go to subscription. So I would assume that you're looking at that metric over time still growing to be the majority of revenue. But is there any way you can frame how you think that, that will play out in the next couple of years?","Mark S. Garrett","I would say exactly what you said, frankly, Brent. It's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger as we drive more and more subscribers, as we drive more ETLAs and as we drive the Marketing Cloud business, which is primarily a SaaS-based business. I don't have an exact figure for you at this point, but it will just keep getting bigger.","Operator","The next question is from Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wondered if you could just comment on what you're seeing in terms of renewal rates from those customers that adopted early last year on promotional pricing. And as you start to see those customers come up for renewal, is it in keeping with your 20% type churn? Or do you think you're tracking better or worse than that?","Shantanu Narayen","So Ross, just to clarify, the subs exit number that we talk about, 1,031,000 in this particular quarter, it is net of attrition. Attrition is running lower than we had originally modeled, which I think is a good sign. And what we also find is that we introduce new offerings, whether it's team, enterprise, the new photography, that customers are migrating amongst these offerings. And so we're pleased so far with what we are seeing in terms of renewal rates. I do want to clarify that we also added the individual app option to the team offering, but that came in really late in the quarter. So this will really be the first quarter where people will also have the option for individual apps within the team offering.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe just to follow up, you're obviously seeing a lot of success with ETLAs and frankly, also Team Edition this quarter. I was curious, when you think about the individual subscribers, how big a driver was education in this quarter? Was it material? And I'm curious to get a sense for ARPU. You said it was pretty consistent. But I should imagine that the individual subscribers outside of team were maybe a little bit lower if education was strong. I'd love any color around that.","Shantanu Narayen","I'll take the first one, Ross, and then maybe Mark can add on ARPU. As it relates to the education segment, we are seeing adoption of the individual offering by students across various categories, so that's good. We're also seeing strength, frankly, in the ETLAs where entire universities are adopting the Creative Cloud. So education, as you would expect in Q3, is one of the drivers of the Creative Cloud subscriptions.","Mark S. Garrett","And on the ARPU, Ross, on the individual and the education side with the promos that we have in place, that's going to pull the ARPU average down. But what you've seen is through the strength of team, which is what we always anticipated in the model, that pulls the ARPU number back up, and that's why you see that ARPU has been holding up very nicely.","Operator","Your next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I was wondering, Shantanu, if you could touch a little bit on Digital Marketing. You guys have put together a pretty comprehensive portfolio of products. And I'm just wondering if you can help shape the opportunity for customers to move from point products to a suite such as yours. And is there a way we can think about the type of uplift as customers maybe moving from just using, say, one of your solutions to taking on the full suite?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Heather, as I think we outlined at our Digital Marketing Summit, our big opportunity really is in getting customers to really [ph] adopt the entire digital marketing cloud, and I would say that's a work in progress. I mean, the real opportunity is when you're a platform for all of the digital marketing needs that a customer has, whether it's their marketing spend, whether it's their campaigns, whether it's their social presence, it should actually represent significant uplift for us in our Digital Marketing revenue because the average number of products that our Digital Marketing customer is using is still low. We made 2 big milestones in the quarter that we just finished in. Target had a brand-new user experience. And one of the things we're doing is in the product you actually have access and visibility to all of the other solutions. So we are making them integrated, much like we did with the Creative Suite of products. So while we're not quantifying exactly what the uplift could be, we definitely see it as an area of internal focus and external growth because the average number of products per enterprise customer, we can continue to grow that quite a bit.","Operator","Your next question is from Brad Zelnick with Macquarie Capital.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Shantanu, do you have any sense of how you're performing against your goals for driving Creative unit growth? And specifically, is there any data that speaks to the cloud offering better to penetrating certain geographies or converting casual pirates or even attracting version laggers?","Shantanu Narayen","So Brad, we continue to do research on that, and all of our research shows that we continue to drive both new users to the Creative Cloud platform. These are users who have never transacted business with us before. And so whether they are brand-new users or previously they pirated products, we see a meaningful number of people who are using and adopting the Creative Cloud. We also continue to see meaningful number of people who give us the feedback that if they did not have the Creative Cloud option, they would have chosen not to transact business with us in the quarter or the year. So on both those dimensions, we continue to make progress.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Sounds like it's working well. Just a follow-up-to Ross' question earlier. For the customer -- it's good to see that attrition is lower than you had baked into the model. But for the customers that don't renew, after storing all their content in your cloud and using the latest versions of your products, where are they going?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Brad, I don't want to lose a single customer, and we're going to work on trying to keep all of those customers. We are seeing some migration where you may have individuals within an enterprise who tried out the individual offering, and then what happens is they actually move to the enterprise offering or the team offering. We will continue to make their assets available to them if they want to be on the free offering that we have. But it tends to be more of the monthly users, and I think what they are doing is primarily trying out the products and then hopefully, migrating to a more comprehensive version.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","That makes sense. And just to be clear, if you see a customer go from a point product and step up into a suite, you're not counting that as churn, correct?","Shantanu Narayen","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question is from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","It sounds like the transition is going faster than expected. But 2 questions. One is at the Analyst Day, Mark, I think you gave us some disclosure of the number of licensees, the cumulative installed base of licensees, including point and suite was about 12.8 million. Now I'm going to ask you a provocative question. What is to stop Adobe from converting all of those licensees into subscribers business? Because if you could, you would end up being the largest -- one of the largest subscription revenue software companies. So thoughts on that. And second, since the discounted window expired, I'm wondering if your ARPU would actually start to go back up as you start to roll in regular prices for folks that were on promotion but are starting to renew as you said.","Mark S. Garrett","Thanks, Kash. Yes, You're exactly right. I mean, we do have 12 million out there in terms of the installed base. And the whole point of putting that slide up for you at Analyst Day was to show you that 4 million is not the end state. 4 million is a goal over the next few years. We fully believe that we will be able to drive much more than 4 million. But we wanted to put a marker out there for you in the short term to show you what we were striving towards. So we would certainly strive towards a lot more than 4 million subscribers. On the ARPU, you're also exactly right. As people renew outside of their promo for the first year, that will drive the individual ARPU up as well.","Operator","The next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","It's actually Matt Williams in for Kirk. Most of our questions have been answered. But just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on the initial customer reaction to Neolane and the marketing automation space in general. And I know you've talked about integration amongst some of the products, and maybe just kind of update us on your plans for integrating Neolane into the marketing cloud.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Matt. I -- Neolane had a scheduled conference that they had scheduled before we announced the acquisition of Neolane. And it was then absolute sellout standing room only because there was a lot of interest in what Adobe products would get integrated with Neolane. So I think the initial response from customers has been this is a no-brainer. It makes complete sense. If I can help with the orchestration of my campaign across social, which you've already had Adobe, and the web where you're a leader and now through email and voice and online and offline. So strategically, we've got very, very positive feedback. I think the next big step was earlier this month when we announced Adobe Campaign. So we've already done the hard work of rebranding the product, starting the integration, making it available as part of our user experience. So while it's work in progress, I think both the initial customer response as well as the initial integration, I think all goes well for that business.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Moerdler with AllianceBernstein.","Emily Chan","Hey, this is Emily Chan dialing in for Mark. I'm wondering if you can talk a bit more about team version of the Creative Cloud now that we have the resellers also pushing this version, how much of a tailwind this has provided. And is that where you're seeing a lot of migration up to the ETLAs?","Shantanu Narayen","Team was very successful in the quarter that we just concluded. It was the first real full quarter of having team offering from the resellers, and so we're very pleased. While it's early, the results have been really encouraging. The ETLAs are happening primarily with the Adobe internal sales force. So the resellers are helping us with presenting the team offering to customers, but the ETLA is all with our internal sales force at this point. I will also say that Adobe.com is doing quite well as it relates to the team offering. In other words, a number of the teams find that they may come to Adobe.com and the process for sign-up is quite easy. And so people are using Adobe.com also as a channel, not just for the individual product, but also for the team product.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Shantanu, Mark, I'd like to follow up on the earlier question about the opportunity for Document Services' recurring revenue, the ARR and ETLA there. If I'm not mistaken, in earlier calls, you suggested that a good part of the momentum in Doc Services' ETLA was due to EchoSign. So the question is, how do you see the opportunity for converting the large base of Acrobat, which is measured in the tens of millions of licenses historically far larger than the Creative base, and much of that through ETLA contracts historically? Do you see the potential for fairly substantial conversion of that historical base of Acrobat to recurrence and potentially getting perhaps multi 9-figure ARR out of that as well? Then I have a couple follow-ups.","Shantanu Narayen","So Jay, a couple of clarifications as well which you know, which is the current Document Services, in addition to EchoSign which is our digital signature solution, we also have offerings in order to enable people to create PDF, to take a PDF and save it out as Word or any other file format as well as the ability to do forms on the Acrobat.com site. In terms of reimagining Document Services to also take advantage of what's happening on mobile devices, to take advantage of the ubiquity of the Reader that we have, as well as provide new services to enable collaboration, clearly, that's in our strategic intent in order to be able to do that. I was answering the question in that I think Acrobat, we will continue to have perpetual for a longer period. But I do think we're seeing adoption of the Document Services by new customers. So both as a new customer acquisition as a growth category, you're absolutely right, as well as in ETLAs. We do think Document Services will see more ARR with new customers, with ETLAs and with the new services that we are providing.","Mike Saviage","Jay, how about one follow-up?","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","And on Creative, how were you thinking about the opportunity for single app adoption? Historically, in the olden days, you would sell perhaps a few hundred thousand new licenses stand-alone of Photoshop, not counting CS. It looks like you're at about that pace now for non-full Creative Cloud adoption. Do you think that you could have a multiple of your former volume business be installed as single app kind of subscription?","Shantanu Narayen","Jay, it was important to us strategically to make sure that we had the single app subscription offer for teams because then teams really have the flexibility to choose. But make no mistake, it's our goal that hopefully, the teams would actually subscribe to the entire team offering, and that really is our goal. So much like for the individuals, while we offer individual products, we're really focused on getting creators to adopt the entire Creative Cloud offering. Our goal would be to do the same, which is offer the individuals. And in many cases, whether it's Photoshop or Illustrator or InDesign, there may be customers who only want individual products. But our goal, even with the team, is to have them subscribe to the entire offering.","Operator","The last question is from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Chaitanya Yaramada sitting in for Steve Ashley. I just wanted to go back to your comments around FY '14 color around revenue, and just wanted to confirm that you said you expect Creative revenue to grow sequentially starting mid next year. And so I was wondering if it's possible that full year Creative revenue could be down year-over-year for FY '14.","Mark S. Garrett","We still expect that full year Creative revenue would be up. It isn't likely up much, but it should be up next year, full year.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then on the Creative transaction growth, just was wondering if you could give us an update on where we are with -- given that you've outperformed on the subscription side.","Mark S. Garrett","I'm sorry, I don't think we understood your question.","Chaitanya Yaramada - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm sorry. Just the combined license plus subscription transaction growth?","Mark S. Garrett","Units? So yes, if you mean total units for both perpetual and subscription, as Shantanu mentioned, we do see growth this year in total units.","Shantanu Narayen","Well, thank you all, again, for joining us today. I think we identified 2 growth initiatives for Adobe, which was reimagining the Creative process, leveraging the desktop, mobile apps and cloud. And it's really gratifying to see the accelerated adoption for our Creative Cloud, which is measured both by the number of subscriptions, as well as annualized recurring revenue. And surpassing 1 million subscribers was a big milestone for the company. The second growth, as well, initiative in digital marketing, which we continue to believe is an explosive growth category, growing that business 28% and successfully adding to our market-leading Adobe Marketing Cloud offering through the acquisition of Neolane was a significant milestone in the quarter.","So thank you, again, for joining us, and we look forward to chatting with you soon.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call today.

Adobe had a record quarter with revenue of $1.77 billion, representing 27% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q2, was $0.75 cents and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.02. We are executing on our strategy of enabling our customers to design and deliver best-in-class digital experiences.","Digital transformation continues to be the burning agenda for creative professionals, enterprises, governments and educational institutions. Adobe is now the go-to company for creating world-class digital customer journeys from design to delivery to measurement and monetization. At the core of our ability to drive transformative change across all customer segments is Adobe Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which is being deployed across all Adobe solutions to solve our customers\u2019 greatest experience challenges.","Central to our strong performance this quarter was record revenue in our Digital Media business. We achieved $1.21 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q2, a 29% increase year-over-year. We exited the quarter with over $4.56 billion of Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q2 was $312 million and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses.","Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for millions of creative people globally and we continue to successfully migrate CS customers, acquire new customers, expand into new market segments, and add value through new services. In Q2, we exceeded the $1 billion mark for Creative product revenue for the first time, an increase of 34% year-over-year. Creative Cloud growth was driven by healthy net new subscription adoption, strong retention and positive trends in our average revenue per user or ARPU.","Our Adobe Stock business continues to accelerate, driven by customer demand for powerful visual content. Last week, we introduced Aesthetic Filters, a next-gen search capability leveraging Adobe Sensei, to streamline one of the most cumbersome, time-consuming tasks for creatives, finding the perfect image or video for creative projects. With nearly 90 million assets, Adobe Stock is becoming the most comprehensive marketplace for digital assets, and this week we announced the availability of new collections from Reuters and Stocksy, with USA TODAY Sports coming soon.","In our video business, Premiere Pro continues to be the leader in the category, with 49% year-over-year growth in single-app subscriptions. At NAB, we unveiled a major update to Premiere Pro, which will help filmmakers and video producers create, deliver and monetize their video assets faster than ever before. This latest update delivers new features for graphics and titling, animation, polishing audio and sharing assets; support for the latest video formats, such as HDR, VR and 4K; and new integrations with Adobe Stock.","Our leadership in video applications is attracting a new set of Creatives to our platform. With flagship applications like Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects, and innovative new apps like Character Animator, we have the most comprehensive video authoring solution. New customers buying single apps like Premiere Pro will be a great base to convert over time to a full Creative Cloud subscription. In addition to video, we continue to innovate in new categories like Experience Design, 3D, and mobile apps, including Adobe Spark, which greatly simplifies the process of designing social graphics, web stories and animated videos. These offerings will expand our footprint and bring new customers to Creative Cloud.","The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud is addressing growing customer demand for more efficient digital processes. In Q2, Document Cloud revenue was $200 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $520 million exiting the quarter. Acrobat units across Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud combined grew double-digits year-over-year, fueled by a record number of new subscriptions in the quarter.","Adobe is focused on delivering innovative capabilities to enable PDF creation in the mobile era. We recently introduced a new app called Adobe Scan, which turns a smartphone or tablet into a PDF creation tool that can do both scanning and intelligent text-recognition through integration with Document Cloud. In its first 12 days, the Adobe Scan app had over 750,000 downloads across iOS and Android.","Adobe is recognized as the leader in the Digital Marketing category and we have expanded our ambition to solve enterprises\u2019 broader customer experience mandate. At Adobe Summit in March, we unveiled Adobe Experience Cloud, a comprehensive set of cloud services designed to give enterprises everything they need to deliver exceptional customer experiences. Adobe Experience Cloud includes Adobe Marketing Cloud, an integrated set of industry leading solutions to help marketers differentiate their brands and engage their customers. Adobe Advertising Cloud, the industry\u2019s first end-to-end platform for managing advertising across traditional TV and digital formats and Adobe Analytics Cloud, the core system of data and intelligence for the enterprise.","We drove a record $495 million in Adobe Experience Cloud revenue in Q2, representing 29% year-over-year revenue growth. We managed more than 135 trillion data transactions on behalf of our customers over the past four quarters across our solutions. This massive volume of data feeds Adobe Sensei, enabling our Experience Cloud solutions to better understand, predict and personalize customer interactions. We announced the availability of our first set of joint solutions with Microsoft to help enterprises transform cross-channel experiences and campaign orchestration using Adobe Experience Cloud and Microsoft Azure, Dynamics 365 and Power BI. In addition, we will collaborate on an industry standard to create semantic data models that will define language for marketing, sales and services which will accelerate the delivery of digital experiences at scale across the entire enterprise.","Adobe\u2019s ad tech momentum continues to build. We have now integrated Adobe Audience Manager into Adobe Advertising Cloud, enabling advertisers to identify high performing segments and do automated, data driven media planning and buying across all channels, including linear TV. Adobe Experience Cloud continues to be the leader across multiple industry analyst categories. Forrester Research named Adobe as the only leader in Digital Intelligence Platforms, an emerging market segment bringing together digital data management, digital analytics and customer engagement optimization technologies. They also recognized Adobe Advertising Cloud as a leader in the Omnichannel Demand Side Platforms and Adobe Audience Manager as a leader in Data Management Platforms. Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Multi-channel Campaign Management, where they placed Adobe furthest in the Leaders quadrant for completeness of vision out of 22 vendors evaluated in the report. Interest in Adobe Experience Cloud continues to be strong. We had record attendance at our US and EMEA Summits as well as at our symposia in New York, London, Mumbai, Toronto and Sydney. Major customer wins this quarter included Best Buy, Cisco, Morgan Stanley and Verizon.","Last week, Adobe joined the Fortune 500 list for the first time, an exciting milestone for our company. This quarter, we were also included on Forbes\u2019 Best Large Employers list and LinkedIn\u2019s Top Global Companies List, and received Great Places to Work recognition in the UK and Germany. People are our greatest asset at Adobe and we continue to invest in creating an innovative culture and exciting work environment to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. With the introduction of Adobe Experience Cloud, we have expanded our vision and our market opportunity. Our brand, coupled with our deep technology platforms are further distancing us from the competition. We have the world\u2019s best customers, partners and employees and we look forward to a strong second half. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks Shantanu. In the second quarter of FY \u201817, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.77 billion, which represents 27% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $0.75 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.02. Highlights in Q2 included; our first $1 billion quarter of Creative revenue, achieving strong net new Digital Media ARR of $312 million, record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $495 million, strong year-over-year growth in operating profit and net income, record deferred revenue with strong cash flow from operations and 86% of Q2 revenue came from recurring sources.","In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $312 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.56 billion exiting Q2. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $1.01 billion which represents 34% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $285 million during Q2 and exited the quarter with $4.04 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued solid demand for Creative Cloud across all segments, including individual, team and enterprise. We saw particular strength on Adobe.com and in the education market. International adoption of Creative Cloud was notable, particularly in Germany and Japan. Q2 ARR performance was also driven by solid retention, as well as quarter-over-quarter ARPU growth across all key offerings.","Adobe Stock contributed to this performance with another quarter of record revenue. We are also pleased to see the growing subscription base for Adobe Stock adding to overall ARR. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $200 million and Document Cloud ARR grew to $520 million exiting Q2. Across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, Acrobat unit growth accelerated when compared to last quarter and again achieved double digit year-over-year growth. In addition, Adobe Sign growth continues and we expect the recent Document Cloud launch with new Acrobat, Sign and Scan functionality to contribute to the overall Document Cloud performance moving forward.","In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $495 million, which represents 29% year-over-year growth. We are hard at work integrating TubeMogul into our new Advertising Cloud solution and Q2 performance with the TubeMogul business continues to track as we outlined earlier this year. TubeMogul gross revenue recognized in the quarter was de-minimus, as forecasted. Mobile remains a key driver for our Experience Cloud business, mobile data transactions grew to 57% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. Experience Cloud success is fueled by a large ecosystem of partners including systems integrators and digital agencies. They are working with us and our joint customers to create digital strategies, plan and execute implementations and achieve value realization. In Q2, partners were involved in approximately 50% of our bookings.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $0.4 million. We had $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201817, versus $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201817, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.6 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $19.2 million. We had $13.3 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201817, versus $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201816, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $9.5 million.","We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 43 days in the year ago quarter and 46 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.07 billion, up 23% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q2 was $4.93 billion. Cash flow from operations was $645 million in the quarter. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a cost of $266 million and we exhausted our $2 billion authority granted in January 2015. In Q3 we will begin utilizing our new $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017.","Now I will provide our financial outlook. In Q3 \u201817, we are targeting; revenue of approximately $1.815 billion, net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $300 million, Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 26%, Adobe Experience Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%, share count of approximately 501 million shares, net non-operating expense of approximately $14 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.72 and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.00.","Given our business momentum, we continued to expect total Adobe revenue, Digital Media ARR and earnings per share to all grow sequentially from Q3 to Q4. When modeling segment and total revenue estimates for Q4 \u201817 it is important to factor the material amount of perpetual revenue reported in our digital marketing business in Q4 \u201816 which we do not expect to reoccur in Q4 of this year. Considering this and our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect total Adobe revenue year-over-year growth to be approximately 23%, an increase from our prior target. In summary, our record Q2 achievement demonstrates we are executing well against a large growth opportunity. We remain excited about our prospects for the rest of the year and beyond.

We would now be happy to take your questions and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks a lot and congratulations. I had one for Shantanu and a follow-up for Mark. Shantanu, just you mentioned Premiere Pro and the success you are having there with the single app products and then you commented that, that could be mechanism to drive more sales into pool of Creative Cloud. And I guess I just had a question on the overall sort of strategy in terms of the potential to create new bundles in the Creative Cloud with the analogy being the Creative Suite, but I think you had 6 different suite types. So I just wondered if you could just elaborate on that for a second and help us think about the opportunities going forward to kind of segment the Creative Cloud product portfolio? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, thanks Ross. I am happy to do so. Also, I wanted to say upfront Mark and I are actually on different cause, I was visiting the debt counsel, so I am in New York and Mark is in San Jose as usual. The strategy, Ross, with Creative Cloud was initially as you know to migrate existing customers. And so it was really important for us to simplify the offering and have a CC complete that we thought would be the right solution for the broad swath of customers that we have. And as you are aware that has played out really well. We always knew that as we wanted to attract new customers, the single app product would be a great stepping stone to get people into the platform and then convert them into full units. This is something that we did in the past whether it was within design during the print era or think products like Dreamweaver or Photoshop or Illustrator, they have always been great ways to attract new customers who may have real experience with one product and then focus on multiple products. And video is clearly being one of those new categories where more and more people are using video and the fact that Premiere Pro is such a great product in video were attracting customers to the platform and then we will convert them into CC complete whether it\u2019s through promotions as well as training. So that\u2019s the way to really think about it, which is when we are doing new customer acquisition just the way, photography has played out really well with photography expansion and market expansion, we think video will be the same. We are equally excited about XD and what\u2019s happening with screen design. So, think about it as bring more customers into the platform through single apps and then convert them to higher ARPU servicing products.","Ross MacMillan","That\u2019s helpful. And just the follow-up for Mark on the ARR, you have obviously exceeded now Q1, Q2 and guiding a bit above where certainly we were for Q3, it looks like you are going to do better than your $1 billion for the year, but you didn\u2019t raise that number. Just maybe any thoughts around sort of the $5 billion sort of exit target how we should think about that? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yes. Actually, if you don\u2019t mind Ross before I answer that question, I want to clarify something. As we were reading our prepared remarks I caught something that needs clarification. So in the end of my prepared remarks we talked about how we now expect Adobe revenue year-over-year growth to be approximately 23%, that\u2019s for the full year. It wasn\u2019t clear whether that was the full year or the quarter, so just to be very clear, we expect the full year to be up 23% year-over-year. So, just make sure you think about that as you update your models. For ARR yes, we are very pleased how that\u2019s playing out Ross, obviously relative to our expectations and we are not updating annual targets but clearly we are on a great trajectory, we had a great first half. And as you know, there is just lots of positive trends that are driving ARR up, everything from ARPU growing across each of the offerings. We have consistently said ARPU continues to grow across each of the offerings bringing new people into the franchise, selling them services, migrating the base over and all those trends continue. So, we are very optimistic about ARR in general.","Shantanu Narayen","And Ross, the other thing I might add here is that we are really focused on the $20 billion large opportunity that exists for this entire business. We were pleased also in addition to the stuff that Mark said with how both Germany and Japan have started to adopt Creative Cloud and Stock as well. So, our focus is continue to execute on the near-term, but focus on the large untapped opportunity that we have.","Ross MacMillan","Great. Thanks, again. Congratulations.","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Ross.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Walter Pritchard from Citi.","Walter Pritchard","Hi, thanks. Mark, I am wondering just on the ARR guidance for Q3 that seems like stronger performance than you are seeing in the last couple of years given that\u2019s a pretty seasonally light quarter and you had strength in areas like Germany and Japan which might be weaker that quarter as well. I am wondering what gives you the confidence and what areas of the business do you expect to see the strength in Q3 ARR for Digital Media?","Mark Garret","Yes. I mean, we kind of touched on it, Walter. We do have seasonality in prior years in the third quarter. So, I don\u2019t think this is anything unusual in terms of strength. We just continue to see momentum across the business though it\u2019s everything from international whether that\u2019s Germany or Japan, like you said, ARPU going up across all the different offerings. We continue to migrate the base over. We continue to attract new users. Stock is contributing to ARR. We are starting to see the benefit of less piracy across the offering. So, all of those factors just play into our performance in the first half and what we see moving forward.","Operator","Your next question is from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.","Tom Mao","Hi, this is actually Tom Mao on for Kirk. Mark, as some of your original ETLA deals come to can you talk about how that\u2019s impacting ARPU for Creative Cloud now that you have a subscription version for the enterprise?","Shantanu Narayen ","Yes. Maybe even I can touch on what we are hearing when we go meet with all of these customers from enterprises. The two points I would make is firstly ARPU is actually increasing. One of the things we track is the amount of the Creative Cloud ETLA customers who are adopting services when they renew their contract. And the second thing we are actually tracking right now is the actual number of users who are downloading and using the products and training it so that we can ensure that our customers get the value associated with it and both of those are going well. That again and even answering Walter\u2019s question gives us confidence as to the ARR moving forward in the Digital Media business. But fundamentally, it\u2019s the adoption of services, it\u2019s the deployment of the Creative Cloud applications and the usage and training associated with it that have all done well for us in the enterprise customer base.","Tom Mao","And just more broadly in the Digital Media business, can you talk about I think you kind of touched on the this a little bit, but just some of the drivers for ARPU increases outside of Adobe Stock?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, I think we have always said that as it relates to getting people on to the platform, the first step is on promotional prices to get them on to the platform. I think we mentioned in the prepared remarks that retention continues to be strong. People are using increased number of products. And so I think when we look at ARPU that\u2019s really the reason and foreign exchange hasn\u2019t had an impact. So it\u2019s true usage as well as adoption of more products that\u2019s driving ARPU.","Tom Mao","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Stan Zlotsky","Hi guys, good afternoon. This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. So one question for Shantanu and then one for Mark, for Shantanu, since the marketing summit what has the customer feedback been like on the partnership with Microsoft, what are customers most excited about and with this combined solution, which parts of the market are you looking to address near-term and then more long-term as the solution matures. And then a quick one for Mark, recurring revenue now just hit 86%, how much further can that go as we go and as we look at 2018 and beyond? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","I think big picture, actually when you look at what customers are saying they are all struggling with digital transformation and they want to understand how we can help them create this digital customer journey and help them take advantage of all of the technology trends that are happening. The combination of Adobe and Microsoft in that regard is clearly providing a more comprehensive solution than each one of us alone and as they are thinking about which is the cloud provider that they would standardize on the fact that we have a great application. On Azure, also really provides great go-to-market synergy between the two build organizations. The first solutions that we identified and we have actually started to deliver are the Adobe Experience Manager solution, which is a managed service on Azure. The second solution is being able to run campaign integrated with dynamics, so think of it as a complete CRM as well as messaging and campaign and orchestration solution and clearly being able to look at all of the data that they have in Experience Cloud and visualize that through Power BI. And so I think it\u2019s the fact that together we have a more comprehensive solution, the fact that the field organization and the marketing organization is very aligned. And the fact that unlike all other partnerships which are press releases the fact that we have actually executed against it and delivered value, I think is leading to a lot of interest in our joint solutions.","Mark Garrett","And in terms of recurring revenue that\u2019s my favorite number. It does just keep creeping up. It\u2019s going to keep going up a bit. But it\u2019s not going to go to 100% if we are always going to have some revenue that\u2019s going to be recognized upfront. But I do expect that it keeps slowly increasing like this is hard to say exactly where it settles in.","Stan Zlotsky","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Mark Grant","Hey, this is Mark Grant on for Heather. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up real quick on the enterprise, as you talked about some of those renewals from the ETLAs from 3 years ago and with the announcements that you made around Experience Cloud at the summit, are you seeing an improvement in customer response there given the introduction of the Experience Cloud and that integrated suite and what\u2019s the impact that you are seeing on typical contract values in the enterprise as you bring that up?","Shantanu Narayen","If you put yourselves in the shoes of a customer, if you are in retail what you are trying to do is ensure that all the assets that you have from creative \u2013 creation of these assets all the way out to delivery are in a consistent life cycle of content all the way from our content creation tools to when it\u2019s delivered either through a mobile application or on the website. If you are an advertising or you are creating a campaign you want to make sure that the brand content that you have created in one country rolls out exactly with the same fidelity across multiple countries. So when we go customer after customer, they are trying to ensure that all of the digital content that\u2019s exploding they have a good way to deal with it and to roll it out with the fidelity and the efficacy that they expect. That\u2019s where the combination of what we have done with Creative Cloud with the ETLA option and AEM assets, the experience manager assets solution is a clear leader in the marketplace. And when I alluded to the fact that services and tracking the service usage within CC ETLA, that\u2019s what we are trying to do which is to make sure that they have the ability to do asset management. So, the interest level I would say 3 or 4 years ago we were pitching this vision of how they could corral all their assets across the enterprise in a global way. Today, they are absolutely utilizing it and getting benefit out of it. So there is no question that we have been able to solve a customer pain point.","Mark Grant","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Moerdler from Bernstein Research.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much. I would like to ask a question both Shantanu and Mark. Given the strong revenue growth for Adobe in the last few years and the expected growth this year of 23%, what would you think are the largest impediments to driving roughly 20% year-over-year growth for the next few years, is it external issues such as market size, lot of large numbers, because more internal issues such as sales staff or breadth of product offering in Digital Marketing, how should we think about it?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Mark I think the first thing we always try to do is to state the overall opportunity in TAM that\u2019s available for us. And we identified that, that was an over $60 billion market opportunity available to us. So I think you start with that. I think you look at the tailwinds that exist in the categories that we are namely content creation and what\u2019s happening on the media side with new media types, what\u2019s happening with augmented reality, virtual reality, more people coming into a Creative franchise. And frankly, as we have always said people having and wanting a story to tell. On the Digital Marketing side, continuing to help businesses transform just like on the individual side we are empowering people to create, it\u2019s a massive opportunity associated with it. So, we look at it and say big picture there is no question that the market opportunity is available. Within the company, we want to make sure we are really focused on building these deep technology platforms. I think at summit Mark, you saw us talk about what we are doing with the data platform and these key strategic partnerships to ensure that we build a moat around our offering and that\u2019s what we are focused on. And we have to continue to execute and focus on our customers. But as long as we keep our customers front and center, the opportunity is there. If you are trying to get us to back into a long target right now we are not going to do that, but we are really pleased with what we did in the first half and we are going to continue to execute against this opportunity.","Mark Moerdler","That\u2019s excellent. I appreciate it. We are just trying to get an understanding of how we should think about it. Any color would be appreciated?","Shantanu Narayen","Okay. Thanks, Mark.","Mark Moerdler","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company.","Derrick Wood","Thanks and nice job on the quarter. A question on the partner front, one of the things we have heard, I have been hearing recently is that demand for certified developers on Adobe, especially the Marketing Cloud is really starting to outstrip supply. So, are there incremental investments you guys are looking at in terms of driving more partner enablement in the channel? And I guess as a follow-up I would be curious if the integration with Microsoft or other ISBs can attract new third-party developers or resellers to your cloud?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. Derrick that\u2019s a great question and I think we said at summit and this is to not just of the U.S. summit, but all around the world. The number of partners who are there and creating digital practices that are based solely on Adobe\u2019s Experience Cloud solutions is growing quite dramatically. I think from our point of view, we continue to ensure that we are providing the best training solutions for these customers. Our professional services organization is available to help them onboard, to help with architectural services that they might need and to continue to be the eyes and ears, but we are thrilled with the number of practices that have been created in every large SI as well as every large digital agency that exists. And so we just have to continue to focus on providing the best training allowing them to download and use our products. All of them are our customers. So they have first hand experience so every thing that they are doing in this particular space.","And with respect to your second question, you are absolutely right, they are a couple of key both digital agencies and SI partners who view the fact that Microsoft and Adobe are working so closely together to actually create a joint practice where they have real experience with integrating these two and delivering that as value to their customers. So as long as it continues to grow and do as well as it has and an Experience Cloud does, there will be a market for somebody who is an expert in specifically the integration of these two offerings.","Derrick Wood","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital.","Saket Kalia","Hi, guys. Thanks for having me in the call. Maybe just to build in that last question for you, Mark, in the prepared comments you mentioned that partners were involved with about 50% of bookings in the Experience Cloud. Qualitatively, could you just talk about how services revenue in the Digital Marketing business has trended and maybe how you are thinking about it going forward?","Mark Garrett","Yes. Services marketing has clearly increased in that business over time as we have driven more implementations into customers, but that is not a critical number for us. From our perspective, a lot of customers want us to do the services, but we are very happy if that partner ecosystem picks up some of the services work as well. So, it\u2019s going to be a mix of us doing it as well as our third-party ecosystem.","Shantanu Narayen","So one thing I might strategically add from a color perspective is one of the things we are doing is as they become more and more facile at doing each of the individual point products, we are focusing our services a little bit more on architecture and the integration between these products as a way to supplement and augment their offerings. And so again I think as Mark said in the prepared remarks, we are thrilled that we have more partners and that they are driving more revenue for themselves and we are happy to augment that through higher end architectural services as required.","Saket Kalia","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray.","Alex Zukin","Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask a go-to-market question around the Experience Cloud, can you maybe comment about the current structure of the sales organization? And maybe as you move towards these bigger solution oriented sales and it\u2019s less kind of individual product focused is how are you realigning or thinking about strategically with the sales organization? And then just a follow-up to Mark, any impacts on deferred revenue that we should be aware of from the ETLA to Creative Cloud conversion or anything else?","Shantanu Narayen","I will take the first part. Certainly, big picture when we think about our go-to-market with sales organization and I am assuming you mean primarily in Digital Marketing, it\u2019s a very traditional named account and organized by vertical with our sales organization in Digital Marketing, so think of it as a financial services or retail or travel and hospitality, media and publishing sales organization, so that our customers clearly understand the vocabulary of the people that they are dealing with named accounts, because these named accounts are increasingly relying on us as the complete mission-critical solution for them. And then we have the equivalent of what you might call either territory or commercial which are customers who are not yet named accounts or other verticals that exist. And we certainly have specialists as well and these specialists are able to augment, but exist with the named accounts. So, the field organization has been structured like that. All around the world, it\u2019s executing against that. One of the new initiatives that we also have in the field organization is the strategy group that\u2019s actually enabling them to have a recipe all the way from going from a digital transformation all the way to how they can start to execute us. So more and more customers are asking us to be their trusted strategic advisor in that particular effect and we stepped up to do that as well.","Mark Garrett","And then Alex, as it relates to deferred revenue, yes, there are a couple of things that you should probably know in there. As you know, it\u2019s comprised of both digital media and digital marketing invoiced bookings. On the digital media side, ETLAs continue to perform well and that flows through deferred. More and more of our business is going through Adobe.com, some of which goes through deferred and then some frankly doesn\u2019t flow through deferred. And then in Digital Marketing, there is a seasonal component to deferred. So, in Digital Marketing, you usually see a decline from Q1 to Q2, because in Q4, we have a very strong booking quarter and those Q4 bookings are typically built and hit deferred in Q1 so then you will see a bit of a seasonal decline in Q2. It was a little bit different than that last year, not to complicate things, because we had the extra week last year in Q1 and that extra week ended up billing in Q2, but typically you do see in Digital Marketing a seasonal decline from Q1 to Q2.","Alex Zukin","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Shantanu, I would be curious if you could compare and contrast the drivers of the strength in Creative Cloud today versus a year ago and specifically wondering how much of the strength is what you are doing in the enterprise versus continued conversions of legacy Creative Suite versus just up-sell an expansion within existing Creative Cloud users?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. Sterling, I think when we identified the three strategies that we were going to continue to focus on which is migration of the Creative Suite based market expansion and delivering new services. I think you have to look at it across each one of those. On the migration side, certainly, we had I think identified in November of 2016 that we have about 7 million people left to convert. We are continuing to make progress against that. We have said that Japan and Germany had lagged. That\u2019s now showing good progress. So, the migration continues well. From a new customer acquisition, the new customer acquisition has been very healthy. And I think the fact that we have combated piracy, you can\u2019t buy a box anymore on one of those e-commerce channels that you were able to the fact that it\u2019s a low price of entry like I mentioned, Sterling, with video, with XD, we have new categories where we are leading the platform. That continues to be really healthy. It starts off a lot with single app and so people come on with a single app and then may move them into the complete suite. Education had a strong quarter. So that was good. And on the CC ETLA and team, I think we are just executing against all of this, our awareness of the customer, our ability for them to get value out of the entire offering is improving. And I would say big picture, Sterling, I think the biggest thing that\u2019s driving it is the creation of good design and content has never been more important, whether that\u2019s for the web, whether it\u2019s for mobile applications. And so it\u2019s not like I can point to one thing that\u2019s actually fueling this business, it\u2019s the fact that we have the most comprehensive offering we are innovating and we are executing, because we understand each customer in a more unique way and are addressing our offering to target them in a personalized way using our Digital Marketing solution. So, I can\u2019t point at one thing, but are pleased with our progress against all of the initiatives we identified.","Sterling Auty","Great. Thank you.","Mike Saviage","Operator, well, we try to fit two more questions in, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening. Two questions for both Shantanu and Mark. Mark, you highlighted the role of Adobe.com as you typically do on the call, could you talk about the margin leverage that you are continuing to get from the growth of Adobe.com? Do you think that\u2019s marginally played out or do you think there is further margin leverage benefits you can get from Adobe.com as the business continues to grow or perhaps you offer some new structural ways of doing business with Adobe perhaps with new combined products, single sign-on and the like? And secondly, with respect to Document Cloud, your ARR increased just over 100 million there year-over-year. At that rate, it would probably take you another 4 or 5 years to get to a $1 billion ARR for Document Cloud, but given the size of the Acrobat base more than double the Creative base and the conversion more and more to subscription. Could you foresee a perhaps material acceleration in the ARR accretion for Document Cloud and thereby get to a much higher 9-figure number sooner?","Shantanu Narayen","Maybe I will start off with the latter one, Mark and then you can, which is on the Document Cloud side, Jay, I think it\u2019s really important to remember that Acrobat is also available as part of the Creative Cloud offering and is doing extremely well as part of the Creative Cloud offering. It\u2019s probably something I should have mentioned even in Sterling and the other questions that are coming. I think we mentioned that Acrobat is seeing a record number of subscriptions and is doing well both in the Creative Cloud funnel as well as in the Document Cloud funnel and I think we have identified many times that one of the choices that we have made is to offer Acrobat as a single opt more in the Creative Cloud funnel so that we can than upsell them to our imaging solution. So I don\u2019t just look at the Document Cloud ARR or the revenue when you think about how well Acrobat is doing, because PDF is actually doing well across both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. And I will let Mark answer the second question.","Mark Garett","Yes. And then as it relates to Adobe.com, Jay as you know we have been scaling Adobe.com dramatically over the past several years as we have gone through this transition. There is no doubt that that has contributed to improved margin. I think it will continue to contribute to improved margin as we continue to scale up the business on Adobe.com. It\u2019s a major, major channel for us now and clearly a profitable, very profitable one.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you.","Operator","The last question is from Samad Samana from Stephens.","Samad Samana","Hi, congrats on a great quarter. Mark, I have a question for you, when I look at the Experience Cloud forecast for the third quarter, it looks like a deceleration which I am really surprised given the year-over-year comp and adding TubeMogul revenue can you maybe remind us if there is a lot of license revenue in the third quarter of last year and also I think you mentioned ASV growth in the past from Marketing Cloud, maybe what that was so we can reconcile that the forecast with our models?","Mark Garrett","Yes. There was some perpetual in the third and especially the fourth quarter of last year as I said in my prepared remarks. You have also got as we have said for quite a while now the mix of ASV subscription and services revenue is well in there and sometimes the services revenue plays into that. But if you look at it across the year, it\u2019s tracking nicely against what we have said.","Samad Samana","Okay, great. Thanks for answering that.","Shantanu Narayen","And since that was the last question, I just wanted to end by saying we are really pleased with our performance in the first half of fiscal \u201917 both by delivering great top line growth as well as bottom line earnings I think what excites us really is the long-term opportunities that we have to continue to empower people to bring their creativity to life as well as to enable businesses to transform themselves. And from our point of view if this combination of content to create the world class digital experience customer journey is that it become so important. And the analysis of that data to deliver great business outcomes we think as what differentiates the modern enterprise and we have a unique mission critical solution in that entire life cycle. We continue to invest in deep technology. We didn\u2019t touch much on AI & ML, but that we believe will continue to distance us from our competitors. We look forward to chatting with you at our next earnings call. Thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes our call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; as well as Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO.","In the call today, we will discuss Adobe's first quarter fiscal year 2013 financial results.

The audio and archive may not be rerecorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. I'm happy to report we delivered revenue of $1,008,000,000 in Q1, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.35. Both results were above our targeted ranges for the quarter. Our Q1 results demonstrate we're executing well on our strategy, delivering strong product innovation across our Digital Media and Digital Marketing businesses and becoming more mission-critical to both our Creative and Marketing customers.","In Digital Media, we're redefining the creative process with Creative Cloud. We drove strong Creative Cloud adoption in Q1. We exited the quarter with 479,000 paid subscriptions, and recently, we crossed the 0.5 million mark. With this momentum, we are on track to reach our goal of 1.25 million paid subscriptions by the end of this fiscal year.","Creative Cloud is becoming the go-to destination for creative professionals, satisfying their need to access all their Creative tools and services, as well as sync and store their work and collaborate with their colleagues. Creative Cloud subscription growth is being driven by its attractive pricing, as well as frequent product, feature and service enhancements we are providing. The value and rich features of Creative Cloud is also helping us achieve our goal of bringing in new customers.","The buzz about Creative Cloud is increasing, and we are seeing significant growth in the number of free Creative Cloud users. We currently have more than 2 million free and trial members, all of whom become a funnel of prospects that we target for conversion to paid subscriptions.","Our Creative Cloud for Teams offering was introduced at the end of last year, and we're starting to see good traction with it on Adobe.com. We expect to see the same momentum in the channel as we continue to educate our customers and partners on its value proposition.","Larger enterprise customers continue to adopt Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLAs. Desktop ETLAs are the first phase of the Creative Cloud for enterprise offering, which will integrate with Digital Publishing Suite and Adobe Marketing Cloud capabilities.","During Q1, we continued to expand the value of our Creative Cloud offering. In December, we announced the acquisition of Behance, the leading online social media platform for Creative professionals. Behance is the location of choice for Creatives to showcase and share their work. All Creative Cloud members will soon gain access to the basic Behance capabilities, while paid Creative Cloud subscribers will also have access to premium Behance features.","The acquisition of Behance accelerates our strategy to bring great community features to Creative Cloud, making it the ultimate destination for creatives worldwide.","Product updates for Creative Cloud members during Q1 included: a new Photoshop release, which includes enhancements such as Smart Object support, new 3D features, improved CSS support, workflow improvements and support for the Apple Retina display; and innovations in our HTML tooling, which includes updates to our Edge products and services and updates to Muse that allow its users to create websites tailored for mobile and tablet experiences.","We have much more innovation coming to Creative Cloud, and we will make some exciting announcements at our MAX conference in May.","In Digital Marketing, we continue to be the leader in this exploding category, targeting Chief Marketing Officers, Chief Revenue Officers, advertising agencies and publishing executives who are looking to accelerate their shift to digital. We drove strong Q1 performance with 20% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth and are building a healthy pipeline. We're on pace to achieve over 25% Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings growth for the year.","With Adobe Marketing Cloud, we have consolidated our 30 distinct product offerings into 5 solutions: Analytics, Experience Manager, Target, Media Optimizer and Social. At Adobe Summit 2 weeks ago, the largest digital marketing conference in the world, we announced a number of new Adobe Marketing Cloud capabilities, including: a new social-enabled touch user interface that surfaces data and insights to marketers and business leaders so they can easily gauge the impact of their marketing dollars, as well as linking with the Creative Cloud and the agency creatives who build and deliver campaigns; new mobile phone and tablet capabilities in Adobe Social; a Digital Asset Management offering, along with other key upgrades, in Adobe Experience Manager, which is enabling customers to re-architect their websites; new predictive marketing workflow capabilities in Adobe Analytics, which lets marketers quickly identify and target high-value audiences in minutes; and a new offering of Adobe Media Optimizer designed for media buying agencies, search engine marketing agencies and direct marketers.","In addition to Summit, where we had record attendance of more than 5,000 people, we held an invitation-only event for CMOs in New York City. This outreach to customers, combined with our ongoing marketing campaigns and the increased focus on our CMO.com web property, is broadly extending Adobe's thought leadership in the Digital Marketing space.","At Summit, our growing ecosystem of partners was evident. We announced a global strategic partnership with Razorfish to jointly create and deliver solutions based on Adobe Marketing Cloud, including integration with their Fluent software. Other key partners showcasing integration with Adobe Marketing Cloud at Summit included Deloitte Digital, ExactTarget, hybris, SapientNitro and Silverpop.","We believe Digital Marketing is a multibillion-dollar category, and as the leader in this space, we're on a run rate to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue. No other company has the relationships with marketers and the end-to-end value proposition that we do, and we're seeing tremendous interest in our solutions from the marketing community.","We announced that we are integrating the Adobe Marketing Cloud with the Adobe Creative Cloud, a significant move that will enable marketers and agency creatives to easily collaborate on their marketing campaigns.","Overall, Q1 was another quarter of strong execution by our employees, and we enter Q2 with great momentum. Now I'll turn the call over to Mark.","Mark S. Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,008,000,000, exceeding our targeted range of $950 million to $1 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.13. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.35.","Key business highlights in the quarter included exiting Q1 with 479,000 paid Creative Cloud subscriptions. This helped drive Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue to a total of $233 million exiting Q1, an increase of $80 million versus Q4's exit of $153 million.","We grew Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue by 20% year-over-year and achieved strong bookings growth. Our total deferred revenue grew sequentially by $80 million to a record $700 million. We exited the quarter with 31% of our Q1 revenue as recurring, up from 26% in Q4.","Looking at our business segment results. In our Digital Media segment, we achieved revenue of $688 million. This segment has 2 major components of revenue: our Creative family of products and our Document Services products.","In our Creative business, we continued to accelerate adoption of Creative Cloud. During Q1, we added approximately 153,000 net new paid subscriptions with our Creative Cloud for Individuals and Teams offerings. Our sales team also continued to migrate enterprise customers to Enterprise Term License Agreements or ETLAs. ETLAs for enterprise customers are similar to Creative Cloud for Individuals in that they are term-based and give customers access to ongoing technology updates and represents the first phase of migrating enterprise customers to Creative Cloud. As a reminder, our Creative Cloud subscription count excludes ETLA units.","Success with Creative Cloud and ETLA adoption helped to drive Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR. Creative ARR is calculated by multiplying the number of current paid subscriptions by the average monthly revenue per user per month multiplied by 12 and adding the annual contract value of Creative product ETLAs.","Exiting Q1, we had a total of $233 million of Creative ARR, up from $153 million exiting Q4 and exceeding our Q1 target of $215 million. As of the end of Q1, 92% of Creative Cloud subscribers are on an annual plan versus month-to-month, and 81% of subscribers are licensed to the full Creative Cloud versus point product subscriptions. Adobe.com remains the preferred way for our customers to engage with us when subscribing to Creative Cloud.","In Document Services, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth in addition to increasing Document Services ARR from $50 million exiting Q4 to $64 million exiting Q1, exceeding our target of $60 million. Continued adoption of our recent Acrobat release combined with growth in EchoSign, our electronic contract solution, and Acrobat Cloud services helped drive this performance.","In our Digital Marketing segment, there are 2 components: The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering; and during the quarter, we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $215 million. This represents year-over-year growth of 20%.","Mobile device use continues to be a driver in the Digital Marketing business. Mobile transactions increased to 25%, up from 22% last quarter. Our focus on 5 solutions in Digital Marketing with a more simplified pricing program is resonating with customers and increasing the potential to create larger engagements with them.","The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses. LiveCycle and Connect contributed $52 million in Q1 revenue, which was consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, as expected. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies.","From a currency perspective, quarter-over-quarter FX rate changes had a $6 million negative impact on reported revenue. Hedging gains contributed $7 million to revenue in Q1 FY '13 versus $2 million in Q4 FY '12, thus the net sequential quarterly currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $1 million.","Year-over-year, FX rate changes had a $13 million negative impact on reported revenue. Comparing the $7 million in Q1 FY '13 hedging gains to the $10 million of hedging gains in Q1 FY '12, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $16 million.","In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 22% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Both the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were lower than targeted, primarily due to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D credit in January 2013. Adobe's GAAP tax rate includes a tax benefit for this credit related to our fiscal 2012, which was essentially offset by tax costs associated with licensing intellectual property. Adobe's non-GAAP tax rate only includes the tax benefit related to the credit for fiscal 2013.","Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 11,196 versus 11,144 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 45 days in the year-ago quarter and 49 days last quarter. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $322 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.66 billion compared to $3.54 billion at the end of Q4. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.7 million shares at a total cost of $100 million.","Now I'll discuss our targets for Q2. For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we are targeting a revenue range of $975 million to $1,025,000,000. In Digital Media, we expect to exit Q2 with approximately $340 million of Creative ARR, up from $233 million exiting Q1. Our targeted Q2 Creative ARR is based on adding slightly more Creative Cloud paid subscriptions than what was achieved in Q1. We expect a sequential quarterly increase in the net new number of subscriptions through the year and expect to achieve our 1.25 million subscription target by the end of the fiscal year.","In Document Services, we expect to exit Q2 with approximately $80 million of Document Services ARR, up from $64 million in Q1. Adding targeted Creative ARR and Document Services ARR yields a total Digital Media ARR target exiting Q2 of approximately $420 million. We expect a sequential quarterly increase in the amount of additional Digital Media ARR through the year to achieve our target of $800 million exiting the fiscal year. It's worth noting that any Digital Media ARR billed in advance, such as ETLAs, is reflected in deferred revenue on the balance sheet.","Assuming the midpoint of our targeted Q2 revenue range, we expect Digital Media reported revenue to be down sequentially due to continued adoption of Creative Cloud subscription and ETLAs.","In our Digital Marketing segment, we continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year reported revenue growth of over 20%. For the rest of our major business areas, we expect reported revenue to be relatively flat quarter-over-quarter.","We are targeting our Q2 share count to be 507 million to 509 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $17 million and $19 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 GAAP tax rate of 22.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.08 to $0.14 per share and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.29 to $0.35.","Given our Q1 results and the benefit of the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 earnings per share targets. We are now targeting FY '13 GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.62 per share and FY '13 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.45.","Q1 was a great start to the year, and we are confident this is the main year of transition in our business. Our strategy and our execution show that the company is better positioned than it has ever been. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mark. We just spent 3 days with our customers at our Digital Marketing Summit and their excitement about this business is palpable. As the leader in this category, we're incredibly well positioned to take advantage of this massive opportunity with the Adobe Marketing Cloud.","Creative Cloud momentum continues to build. We are regularly releasing new innovation and are dramatically enhancing and simplifying the creative process for our customers. We encourage you to attend our MAX conference in May, where we will be making some exciting announcements. We look forward to seeing you then. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks, Shantanu.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Shantanu Narayen","And before we get started, I also want to apologize. We received feedback that the phone line and audio quality was poor. I do hope you all have access to the prepared remarks, which are available on Adobe.com. But in addition, absolutely feel free during the Q&A to ask us to repeat any of the data that we might have provided in the prepared remarks. Thank you.","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Peter Goldmacher with Cowen & Company.","Peter L. Goldmacher - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Two quick questions. Can you talk about ASPs on the 153,000 subscribers in the quarter? It looks like they were ticking up, and you talked about more people taking the entire -- taking suites, so I'd love to know about that. And Digital Marketing, by our organic calculation, was about 16%, which was a little bit lighter than we were hoping for. Would love some more color on that.","Shantanu Narayen","So, Peter, let me get both of your questions. The first one on the ASP, I think it was relatively flat. And so that's what I would share as it related to the ASP of the subscriptions that we saw. I mean, we certainly had, as we talked about, 153 new -- net new subscriptions in the individual and team, so we are pleased with that. And Digital Marketing, what I did say on CNBC earlier today was also the fact that bookings actually grew a very healthy over 25%, so we're very pleased with the strength in the business. And the revenue grew as well, 20%. One of the things to remember in that particular business is that there still is a certain amount of business that's taken on-premise, the Adobe Experience Manager, and so there's certainly a growing of the pipeline that happens during the quarter. And then we're rebuilding that healthy pipeline. So underlying trends in both of the businesses, very strong.","Peter L. Goldmacher - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Can I just ask you a quick question on the bookings number. Are you seeing contracts get a little bit longer to drive your total bookings? Are people willing to commit for longer duration? Is that partially what's driving that bookings number to 25%?","Mark S. Garrett","Peter, it's Mark. The bookings number that we're talking about is just annual contract value, so it's just the first year's worth of any agreement with the customer.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Shantanu, could you talk about the impact of Team Edition in the quarter? And I have a quick follow-up for Mark.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So, Brent, as we mentioned, we have introduced the Team Edition. It's available both through Adobe.com, and so small and medium businesses and teams and marketing departments can actually transact business directly with us, as well as you are now making that available in the channel. During Q1, the majority of the net new subscriptions that we saw were actually continued to be individual, both in the commercial as well as in the education space. Adobe.com is off to a good start, and we're aggressively educating the channel partners as well as new online partners that will be effective channel for us on the team, and so we continue to expect to see acceleration in the team with channel partners Q2 through Q4.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And, Mark, just on EMEA, down double digits year-over-year and sequentially. Can you just give us your view what's happening there and specifically how you think about the pipeline for the rest of the year for EMEA?","Mark S. Garrett","Yes, Brent. Europe did well for us frankly. It's a little different looking at the mix, especially as it relates to Creative because as we move to subscriptions more and more, obviously, that has an impact on reported revenue until we get through the transition. But we did not see any unusual problems in Europe. Europe is definitely stabilized and is performing well, and the business looks good going forward.","Operator","Next we have the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Mark, is there any way to size the ETLA component within Creative? And the reason I'm asking is because obviously, that's incremental to the individual and team subs. Any color on that you could help us with?","Mark S. Garrett","Well, so I'll tell you how you could go do it. You could take the number of subscribers times that average revenue per user per month, which has been, as Shantanu just said, relatively consistent, times 12, and that will give you an ARR number. The difference between that ARR number and the ARR number that we reported for total Creative is basically going to be the ETLA component.","Shantanu Narayen","I think it's fair to say that the ETLA business, the transition on the sales side to being able to sell these term desktop ETLAs is going well, Ross.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that was my sense. So what happens when you introduce enterprise subscriptions? How should we think about that ETLA to enterprise subscription transition?","Shantanu Narayen","I would actually, Ross, look at what we are offering today, which is these ETLAs as the first phase of the enterprise offering. It enables an enterprise customer to get all the benefits of the desktop products with all of the enhancements and innovation that we add to it. What we are also seeing among enterprise customers is a desire to make sure that these desktop products continue to work with the server-based products that we have. We announced at Summit, Ross, that the next version of the Adobe Experience Manager has a digital asset management component, so that's an add-on. We also have Digital Publishing Suite, that's an add-on, and Adobe Experience Manager, that's an add-on. So I would actually say that the transition to the enterprise offering has begun, and the sales force is focused on getting enterprise customers to buy the term license.","Mark S. Garrett","And keep in mind, the enterprise ETLA numbers do not get reflected in our subscriber counts, right?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Right, exactly. And then maybe sort of very last one. I know that last year, you'd helped us think about an equivalent unit growth number by using the sort of proxy for the perpetual or upgrade license price. Any way to think about that as we move through Q1 in terms of what you think the like-for-like units look like on the Creative side?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Ross, we did see unit growth in the quarter, so I'll state that. But we'll provide updates on that. More on an annual basis, I think Mike talked about at MAX, we'll provide further color and update into the business. But I think big picture, we're on track. Subscriptions are doing well, the product offering's being well received and individual team and enterprise initial offering are all now in the market.","Operator","Next we have the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Kenneth Wong","This is Ken Wong for Walter. Just a quick question on the 1.25 million sub guide for the year. I mean, your run rate in February, and I guess a little bit in March, would suggest you guys are kind of 10,000 to 12,000. And you guys probably to have hit mid-20s in the back half to achieve those goals. What gives you comfort that you guys can get to that 1.25 million number?","Mark S. Garrett","Ken, yes, it's Mark. As we pointed out in the prepared remarks, the ramp just accelerates as we go through the year, so the net additions each quarter gets larger. Each sequential quarter as we go through the year, it gets us to that 1.25 million. Some of that's just going to be more and more awareness of the offering. Some of that's going to be the viral nature of the offering. Some of that's going to be the constant innovation that we put out in the offering, as people see more and more go to the cloud. And the customer feedback is really what gets us confident in reaching that 1.25 million.","Kenneth Wong","Got you. And then as we start to anniversary the Creative Cloud offering that you guys introduced last year, how should we think about retention rates there?","Shantanu Narayen","I think when we talked about our targets for the year, we said that the 1.25 million is certainly net of any attrition that we would expect. As you point out, we're coming up on the first anniversary for those who subscribed to it, and we're confident that there's a lot of innovation. But there is a retention rate that we have built in and an attrition that we have built into our targets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with Morgan Stanley.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. I just wanted to drill into that 2 million free number on the Creative Cloud, and that number is getting -- I mean, it was big last quarter, it's even bigger now. What's your sense of the conversion rates potentially for that population? And where are those users coming from at this point? What's your sense there?","Shantanu Narayen","Jennifer, I think in terms of who is signing on for our trial or a free membership, there are really 2 kinds of folks who are signing up: the first is people who want to try out our products. Trials have always been a good way for people to try out the products before buying. And so as we move from the trial downloads that Adobe has had historically to this free and trial members, that's certainly one of the ways in which we are signing up new members. But also it's important to remember that some of the free members are members who are participating in a collaborative workflow with other Creative professionals rather than all of them necessarily being potential customers for the entire offering. We have our conversion rates. Every Monday morning, we look at what's happening with respect to people moving through the funnel. But we're not going to give you numbers on a quarterly basis in terms of that conversion. I think it just shows a healthy pipeline of people that we are going after in order to convert them to paying customers.","Jennifer Swanson Lowe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And maybe just switching gears a little bit and following up maybe on Peter's line of questioning earlier on. You've got 25% bookings growth in the Digital Marketing business within the cloud component of that. The revenue growth is a little bit slower than that. Is there a reason why we shouldn't see the revenue growth there start to approximate that 25% bookings growth number? Or is there some -- in theory, it should. So is there some reason why it wouldn't or we shouldn't be thinking about it that way?","Shantanu Narayen","There'll always be a lag, Jennifer, between the bookings and the revenue. The way we charge our customers is after they make a contract with us, we have to get their servers up and running. And until they start to run transactions through our servers, they will not be participating. So I think there's always going to be a lag between the bookings and the revenue. But certainly, we've said that we expect to see 20% revenue growth, given how large we believe the market is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I see a headline going across some newsletters that Kevin Lynch has resigned and left the company or is going to leave. I wonder if you can confirm that and if that's true, maybe give us a little color on that.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Steve. Yes. I mean, Kevin has made significant contributions during his time at Adobe, and I am really grateful for that. He's decided it's time for a new adventure. And he's off on that and we're on our adventure and momentum in our business continues. So I wish him well, but yes, that is confirmed.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And will you do a search to backfill his position?","Shantanu Narayen","No, Steve. At this point, we have no plans to backfill the CTO position. As you know, Bryan Lamkin rejoined the company and so Bryan is taking on all of the responsibility for both the long-range advanced technology that we are doing within the company, as well as the cross business unit product integration.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then I just had a question on hiring at your customers. We've really not seen a lot of hiring of marketing professionals in several years but I've seen a couple signs that maybe that's picking up, and I was just wondering if you had any comments on that.","Shantanu Narayen","I think in terms of the 2 macro trends that we continue to look at, Steve, is certainly, the amount of data that's being created and the amount of video that's being created, mobile applications, digital publications just continues to go up and to the right. And then marketing, there is more and more of that spend that's moving digital. So I think both macro trends are positive. I don't track myself the hiring among our customers, but I think as Mark said, the stability that we saw in all geographies seems to suggest that the economy is doing well.","Operator","Next we have the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So 2 quick questions. The first was, it appears -- it's obviously that Digital Media drove the beat and yet subscriptions was higher. Are we seeing a tick-up in license acquisition in here as pure play license or license upgrade? Can you give some sense in terms of this?","Shantanu Narayen","Mark, I think the strength in the Creative business was across-the-board. You are right in pointing out that both reported revenue as well as subscriptions was strong. And I think it just reflects the underlying strength of that business.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Is -- the other part of that, is the convert from this -- are we seeing an increase in the convert from month-to-month to annual in here? Do you measure that? Can we get a sense of it?","Shantanu Narayen","We do measure that. I think the fundamental trends in the subscription business have always been that the entire Creative Cloud is the majority of the subscriptions that we have. And within that, an annual commitment is the majority. So that really hasn't changed. And I think some of those numbers are actually numbers that are in the prepared remarks. And so that part may have been unclear, but it's available for you, Mark, on our website.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","But no, I know the number is in there. I was just going to see if there was any sense in terms of whether you're having success in converting month-to-months to annuals?","Shantanu Narayen","No, I think there are folks who use it as an on-ramp and that's been successful. I think the vast majority of people are already signing up for the annual subscription and the entire subscription, which I think just reflects the value that's available in the entire Creative Cloud offering.","Operator","Next we have the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","A pricing question and a product question. In terms of pricing on the Digital Marketing side, is there a case to be made that you could or should offer some or all of the solutions on a rentals basis? Is there a case to be made that in addition to the annual or multiyear contracts, that some kind of periodic rental availability of some part of Digital Marketing might make some sense? And then on the Digital Media side, could you just talk about your thoughts on making the upgrade, packaged upgrades, increasingly unappealing economically to further drive customers towards the cloud. Then a follow-up or 2.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Jay. So first the question on Digital Marketing. At Summit, as you know, we announced these 5 solutions: Analytics, Target, Social, Media Optimizer and Experience Manager. And we took the approximately 30 products that we had and we've integrated them a lot better as well as provided them in terms of simplified pricing and on-ramp for customer. As part of that, one of the things we do offer the larger enterprise customers is because they have now subscribed to the Creative Cloud as part of the overall transactions that they are committing to do with the company, they can certainly try out some solutions that they haven't already explicitly purchased. So I think this does allow \"try before you buy\" of some of our new solutions with customers as long as they have the appropriate capacity to do that within their annual cycle. So I think it actually does help. We don't offer a rental per se, but this is the goal in order to make a simple on-ramp definitely is available. And your question on Digital Media, I think it's becoming increasingly clear, frankly, to our customers that the pace of innovation on the Creative Cloud is just going to get faster and faster. And so that's really our focus in demonstrating the value proposition of that. And people who are on the perpetual product are going to fall further and further behind on the innovation. So I think we are more focused right now on innovation, and we will continue to explore pricing across both those.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just 2 follow-ups. On the product side, could you, with respect to the integration you talked about of Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud, explain how something like Digital Publishing Suite can help induce business on the Digital Marketing side, and in reverse, how something like CQ could induce incremental business, not only in Digital Marketing, but also on the Digital Media side? And then lastly for Mark, does the change in earnings guidance for the year take into account at all the discontinuation of packaged products that you've now talked about? Have you built in some reduction of cost of revenues from that?","Shantanu Narayen","So you want to take the second question?","Mark S. Garrett","Yes, sure. So Jay, as you pointed out, we are moving away from shrink-wrapped, boxed product. We will have some savings from that, in the fact that we don't have to manufacture and ship that boxed product anymore. That's factored into the guidance. I mean, it didn't really drive that $1.45. The $1.45 is really driven through the R&D tax credit, and more so than anything else, the beat that we had in Q1. The savings on the packaged products does, to some extent, get offset by the fact that we have storage costs and things like that through the Creative Cloud offering. But there are savings there.","Shantanu Narayen","And to answer your first question, Jay, I think virtually every Chief Revenue Officer or Chief Marketing Officer, as they think about the various channels through which they communicate with their customers, application stores and online web properties are now part of the same story. And so if you're an automotive manufacturer that wants to create, in fact, a website and wants to create a manual digitally, you want to have a similar workflow to do that. One is executed through DPS, one is executed through the Adobe Experience Manager. If you're a media company, you're certainly going to make sure that what you provide on your web is consistent with the way in which you provide your digital publications. We are now up to something like 250,000 digital publications that are delivered, editions everyday through the iStore. So we're continuing to see progress in DPS, not just with digital magazines, but also with training material and manuals, collateral, catalogs and retail information that's going out there. So there is really a lot of synergy between going into a large customer, communicating that we have the desktop applications to allow them to create the video they want, the mobile applications they want, as well as the web content and to have both of our service solutions work seamlessly with that.","Operator","Next we have the line of Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","I have one for Shantanu and a follow-up for Mark. Shantanu, can you talk about how you're doing against your goal of driving overall Creative unit growth? The subscription numbers look really strong this quarter, but can you give us a sense of which users are making the transition? How do you think you're doing in converting piracy and getting version laggards on board?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. So Brad, we did see unit growth in the quarter, which again we said last year that we grew units approximately 13% for last year, so while we are not providing a specific number, I can confirm that we are actually growing units. We're seeing certainly a new customer base that's coming on, a customer base that's never done business with Adobe. And whether it's as a result of they are the next generation of Creative or the affordable pricing, we're attracting customers. And we are seeing more and more people on prior versions as we provide affordable on-ramp for them also moving. I would say the majority of the subscriptions today is still individual, as I mentioned, in both commercial and freelancers in commercial and education. And I think the focus in the remaining quarters is going to be on team. And in the enterprise space, we are seeing -- Matt and the sales force are seeing good adoption of the enterprise term license agreements as well.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","That's helpful, Shantanu. And Mark, on margins, I appreciate your past commentary that earnings should grow at least as fast as revenue from here, and while gross margin should come down with the transition to cloud products, shouldn't you also see offsetting leverage in sales and marketing over time as it presumably costs less to renew a customer than to acquire a new one? So just net-net, is it unreasonable to think that this business can eventually return back to the 35%-plus margin level that you were at?","Mark S. Garrett","So Brad, I'm not going to get into kind of long-term margin profile right now. Obviously, margins will go up from this year into next year. We said that revenue grows, margins grow, earnings grow. We are focused more on driving earnings at least as fast as revenue growth. And while clearly, margins will improve from here, it's going to depend a lot on where they go relative to the mix, not only of just what happens in the Creative product as it relates to subscriptions, but also the total mix between Creative and Digital Marketing as Digital Marketing will never be at the margin profile that our old business was. So again, we're focused on revenue growth and earnings growth, and margins will improve from here. I'm just not at a point where I want to give you a long-term target.","Operator","Next you have the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I missed a couple of minutes earlier so you may have talked about this. But in talking with the channel partners, they're definitely itching to get the Creative Cloud enterprise offering. In what quarter are you expecting that Creative Cloud Enterprise is going to hit and will that result in a material step-up in adds when that's available?","Shantanu Narayen","Mike, we didn't provide a specific date as it relates to channel partners. We said the focus has really continued to be on team right now and making sure we educate them, have the right incentives for them to renew the existing installed base. And we'll provide further updates on all of that stuff at MAX.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Let me just try. In the interest of kind of looking at the kind of linearity of sub adds. So when it does hit, will it cause a big spike up in adds in that quarter whenever that quarter is?","Shantanu Narayen","So again, I think it's important to remember that the units that we described will be units for individual and team. The ARR number that we communicate will be ARR associated with enterprise units that we have. And so the way we're going to continue to report it is we will certainly report individual and team, and we will report total ARR, which includes enterprise units.","Operator","Next we have Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Sonya Banerjee on for Heather Bellini. I guess just one quick question on the Creative Cloud. How should we be thinking about the core perpetual base and the pace of migration to subscription this year? In other words, can you touch on the assumptions that you've baked into your targets for this year or even longer term as it relates to perpetual migration?","Mark S. Garrett","Sonya, this is Mark. Well, we obviously guided to 1.25 million subscribers this year. We guided to 4 million subscribers by the end of 2015. And obviously, the majority of the subscribers are going to be people moving over from perpetual to subscription. We are going to attract new users but the majority of the subscriber base is going to come from existing customers.","Sonya Banerjee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. I guess part of the reason I asked the question is because at recent events, it seems like you've spoken to potentially introducing incentives to accelerate the migration of perpetual CS users to the Creative Cloud. So that's part of the reason why I was asking. Are these incentives likely to come this year? Is this a longer-term event?","Shantanu Narayen","Again, I think we've said this is the heart of the transition this year, so the numbers that we expect our baked into our targets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just got a question back on the -- your marketing initiatives there. You've seen a lot of consolidation across the Digital Marketing ES space. Oracle, salesforce.com, et cetera. Shantanu, just wondering if you get a sense of how you just feel about your portfolio there. And as it starts to evolve, how we should think about the product segments that you might expand into?","Shantanu Narayen","I think we feel terrific about our portfolio, and I think you're seeing that relative to the success that we are having. We're the leaders in analytics, which I think is the core of providing insights to our customers. We're the leader in the technology space as it relates to re-platforming of the websites with our Experience Manager solution, which is certainly a worldwide phenomena that you're seeing. Everybody's gearing up for mobile and tablets. And so we feel very good about the product portfolio that we have. And the affinity that we have with marketers as a result of the brand and heritage that we've had with these customers is absolutely unparalleled. So others are going to take different approaches of going into IT. We are focused on CMOs. We've said that, that is the big growth opportunity for us. We're the big data company for marketers. And we continue to intend to innovate in that space.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Shantanu, kind of wanted to follow up on that prior question. You guys have historically partnered for your eCommerce platform, but as you increasingly integrate Digital Media and Marketing and see the continued evolution that you're discussing within the marketing category, is it time to bring an eCommerce platform in-house?","Shantanu Narayen","We have some great partnerships in that space right now, so we have a joint solution with customers in that space. I think eCommerce is an important component. But the beauty of the Marketing Cloud that we have right now is that there are so many adjacencies, and continuing to partner with them actually just continues to lift our ecosystem. We mentioned in the prepared remarks that there were a number of these partners all presenting at our Summit, so whether it's email partners like ExactTarget or eCommerce, as you asked, like hybris. We have some great partnerships that are in there, Silverpop, Responses, Deloitte Digital. So I think the partnership strategy is actually very sound, and we continue to partner with a lot of these folks to build a complete solution.","","Well, thank you again for joining us. I think if you think about the Q1 results, it clearly demonstrates the strong momentum and, frankly, excellent execution that we're -- against our stated growth objectives. We're pleased with the subscriber growth that we are seeing and we're seeing traction in both the team as well as the enterprise offerings, which are relatively new. And there is an exciting product roadmap as we continue to reimagine the Creative process. And in Digital Marketing, I think it's clear that it's acknowledged to be an explosive new enterprise category, also based on some of the questions that you've asked. In our DNA, it's clear we're about creativity and marketers have a very strong affinity to our brand, and the business is doing really well. And our differentiation, frankly, is closing that loop, the last millisecond of content delivery, which is integrating our content offering and content delivery platforms, we believe, will continue to be a unique advantage for us. So we're driving innovation, serving our customers well and building, as Mark said earlier, a really meaningful recurring revenue stream. We hope to see all of you at MAX, and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would like to now turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen, as well as Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO.","In the call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s first quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago.","We\u2019ve also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, our financial targets, and an updated investor datasheet on adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to the Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links.","Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue, subscription and operating model targets, and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, March 17, 2015, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty.","Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure in the earnings press release we issued today, as well as Adobe\u2019s SEC filings.","During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is available in our financial targets document and in our updated investor datasheet on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website.","Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live in Adobe Connect and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe\u2019s Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be rerecorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","FY15 is off to a strong start. In Q1, we reported revenue of $1.109 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44. We achieved solid growth across our Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses, and delivered a new wave of product innovation.","In Digital Media, Creative Cloud continues to be the preeminent destination for creatives around the world, enabling them to work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. While the desktop applications continue to be the foundation of Creative Cloud, 50% of Creatives are using mobile devices in their creative process.","Over 30 million mobile apps have been downloaded, including capture apps like Adobe Brush and Shape, as well as desktop companion apps for Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC. Over 5 million new free subscribers were acquired through our Creative Cloud mobile apps since MAX in October.","We celebrated the 25th anniversary of Photoshop last month and were blown away by the tremendous response from customers, partners and the press. Photoshop is one of the world's most iconic brands and has had a profound impact on every form of design and media, from animation to photography to film to web design. Through consistent innovation over the span of two and a half decades, Photoshop has stayed fresh and relevant and is now attracting a new generation of fans.","We continue to successfully migrate the Creative Suite installed base, as well as bring new customers into the community. In Q1, Individual and Team adoption grew by 517,000 to over 3.9 million subscriptions. This represents 28% year-over-year growth in net new subscriptions. Creative Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR grew to $1.79 billion exiting Q1.","Delivering on our promise to make Creative Cloud the one-stop shop for creatives, we closed the acquisition of Fotolia in January. Stock content is a part of an incremental $4 billion of addressable market for Adobe. 93% of stock content sellers and 85% of stock content buyers use our tools.","Work is underway to integrate Fotolia into Creative Cloud, providing current and future Creative Cloud members with the ability to access and purchase over 35 million images and videos within the Creative Cloud experience.","We will also continue to operate Fotolia as a standalone stock service, accessible to anyone. With seamless integration, we believe we can increase Creative Cloud ARPU over time, as well as grow Adobe\u2019s share of the stock content market.","In Document Services, today we announced the Adobe Document Cloud, a modern way to manage documents at home, in the office and across devices. Adobe Document Cloud will include an all new version of Acrobat called Acrobat DC, which has an intuitive, touch-enabled interface and features revolutionary new mobile capabilities. ","For the first time, eSign Services, formerly Adobe EchoSign, will be included with every Adobe Document Cloud subscription to enable sending and signing from any device. Adobe Document Cloud will integrate analytics and capabilities to manage, track and control documents.","Adobe invented PDF and it is the de facto standard in the documents category. We see a sizable opportunity ahead of us in the documents space to monetize the millions of existing Acrobat customers and hundreds of millions of Reader and PDF users.","We plan to make Document Cloud available to our customers as both a perpetual and subscription offering within the next 30 days. It will also be available to our Creative Cloud subscribers as part of the full Creative Cloud offering.","In Q1, we reported Document Services revenue of $193 million and exited the quarter with $297 million of ARR. Across our Creative and Document Services businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $2.09 billion as of the end of Q1.","In Digital Marketing, reported revenue for Adobe Marketing Cloud in Q1 was $311 million, representing 17% year-over-year revenue growth. Last week, we held our Digital Marketing Summit in Salt Lake City, which has become the premier marketing industry event for marketing, media, and publishing professionals around the world. With over 7,000 attendees, Summit has become the biggest pipeline building event of the year.","We introduced two new Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, Adobe Primetime, the industry\u2019s leading multi-screen TV platform; and Audience Manager, our fast-growing data management platform as well as new capabilities in Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics.","We highlighted advancements in mobile marketing and app development, the extension of marketing intelligence into product design and Internet-of-Things, and the fusion of ad-tech and marketing technologies. Customers from some of the world\u2019s top brands joined us on the keynote stage, including executives from Under Armour, Time Warner Cable, Girl Scouts of America, Starwood Hotels and Resorts, and National Australia Bank.","Partners play a significant role in our go-to-market strategy and the ecosystem of companies who recommend, sell, and deliver Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions continues to grow. We announced a new partnership with IBM, which will provide specialized enterprise consulting capabilities for Adobe Marketing Cloud. We announced an expansion of the alliance with Accenture through the launch of Accenture Customer Engagements, a cloud-based managed service that simplifies the development, execution, and measurement of digital marketing. ","We have built two fast-growing cloud businesses and are well on our way to building a third. All three share a common goal of enabling our customers to make, manage, measure and monetize virtually every type of content. We are driving the future of digital media and marketing in a way that no other company can, and we are excited about our roadmap for the year. Mark?","Mark Garrett","In the first quarter of FY \u201815, Adobe achieved revenue of $1.109 billion above the high end of our targeted range. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 were $0.17 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.44. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Fotolia which contributed $7 million in revenue in Q1 and was not material to non-GAAP earnings per share.","Highlights in our first quarter include, delivering revenue above the high end of our targeted revenue range; achieving 28% year-over-year growth in net new subscriptions to Creative Cloud; closing the acquisition of Fotolia, which when combined with other creative marketplace services we offer, increases our creative addressable market by $4 billion, Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $311 million and exiting Q1 with a record 70% recurring revenue.","In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $703 million. This segment has two major components of revenue, our creative family of products and our Adobe Document Cloud products.","In our creative business, we exited Q1 with 3,971 million Creative Cloud subscriptions. Net new Creative Cloud subscriptions increased by 517,000 in Q1, consistent with our expectations given Q1 seasonality. Retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions, including renewals after promotional pricing expiration, continues to track ahead of our initial projections.","Q1 adoption of Creative Cloud for teams grew substantially on a year-over-year basis, and we are building a healthy Enterprise Term License Agreement or ETLA pipeline. Average revenue per user, or ARPU, within each of our Creative Cloud offerings maintained steady levels, consistent with results over the past year. Blended ARPU across all Creative Cloud offerings declined slightly as a result of mix.","As we discussed last week at the Financial Analyst Briefing at Summit, Creative Cloud Single Apps and the Creative Cloud Photography Plan are expanding our market opportunity through the addition of new customers, and create the potential for higher ARR in the future via ARPU-enhancing services such as Fotolia, and upsell to higher-tiered Creative Cloud offerings.","Consistent with our expectations, creative ARR grew to $1.79 billion, an increase of $180 million quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, we revalued ARR exiting FY2014 based on December 2014 currency rates.","With Document Services, in advance of the Adobe Document Cloud launch, we achieved revenue of $193 million. Document Services ARR grew to $297 million exiting Q1. This ARR growth was driven by adoption of Acrobat ETLAs, subscriptions and Document Services including EchoSign.","In our Digital Marketing segment, there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering, and our momentum as the leader in this market continued. Last week at Summit, we discussed growth with large customer engagements and multi-solution selling. Our announcements and the pipeline that gets built at our conference should continue this success in 2015.","In Q1, we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $311 million, up 17% year-over-year and consistent with our expectations. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $46 million in Q1 revenue, consistent with our expectations. Print and Publishing segment revenue was $49 million in Q1. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $17 million. We had $24 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY15, versus $12 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY14. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $5 million.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $26 million. Considering the $24 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY15, versus $3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY14, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $5 million.","In Q1, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 48% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was higher primarily due to tax costs associated with licensing acquired company assets to Adobe\u2019s trading companies. These one-time costs were partially offset by tax benefits related to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. R&D credit in December 2014.","Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 12,698 versus 12,499 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 46 days in the year go quarter, and 50 days last quarter.","Cash flow from operations was $183 million in the quarter. The sequential decline from Q4 is consistent with previous first quarters since prior year annual bonuses and commissions are paid in Q1, as well as prepayments of certain employee fringe benefits for the current year.","Deferred revenue grew to $1.18 billion, up 34% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.18 billion, compared to $3.74 billion at the end of Q4. The primary driver of this decline was the acquisition of Fotolia which closed during the quarter.","In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares at a cost of $174 million. In January, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program granting us the authority to repurchase an additional $2 billion of common stock through the end of FY 2017.","Now, I would like to provide our financial outlook.","In Q2 of FY'15, we are targeting a revenue range of $1.125 billion to $1.175 billion. Assuming the midpoint of our Q2 revenue range, we are targeting total Digital Media and Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue to grow sequentially. We also expect LiveCycle and Connect revenue, and Print and Publishing revenue to be relatively flat.","During the quarter, we expect to add more net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and Digital Media ARR than what was achieved in Q1, and we continue to expect both to grow sequentially in the third and fourth quarters.","We are targeting our Q2 share count to be 508 million to 510 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $15 million and $17 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.","These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share, and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.41 to $0.47. We\u2019re pleased with our performance in Q1, and we\u2019re off to a great start for the year. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Adobe MAX will occur again in Los Angeles this fall during the week of October 5th. We will provide registration information later this summer.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick at Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Thank you very much for taking my questions. Mark, you said the 517,000 Creative sub adds was consistent with your expectations, given Q1 seasonality. So this is very different than last year\u2019s Q1 seasonality if we just look at subs. But can you maybe frame it for us in the context of total Creative units since obviously there is a lot less Creative perpetual revenue this year?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So let me also jump in a little bit on color for the quarter and then Mark can add to that. I think we\u2019ve been telling you for a while that Digital Media ARR is really the best health for the business, and as you saw that grew to $2.09 billion. One of the things that I think we should also reflect is that, we offer customers multiple ways to acquire Acrobat subscriptions. And depending on the type of customer, this can get reflected in either the Creative subs and ARR Brad or the document ARR.","So when you acquire Acrobat as part of CC offering whether it\u2019s single app or complete, that\u2019s reflected in the Creative ARR. And when you get it as part of the Document Cloud offering, the ARR is then reflected in the Document Cloud. And this is actually very similar to the way in which we offer the perpetual software when we had Acrobat as well as Creative Suite.","So one of the things in the quarter was that as we contemplated the Acrobat mix changing, we experimented we\u2019re driving more Acrobat in conjunction with the Document Cloud launch. So if you look at the Acrobat subs ratio in Q1, if they were reflected in CC subs similar to prior quarters, the Creative reported subs would have been significantly higher.","And so I think a number of you probably had the mix different in terms of being over-weighted in CC subs and ARR since you guys were unaware of the experimentation we were doing in conjunction with the Doc Cloud launch. So when we look at the results that we had in Q1 overall, as it relates to Digital Media ARR and adoption of the Creative Cloud and Acrobat, that\u2019s why we said it was very much in line with our targets.","Mark Garrett","I think the only thing I would add to that\u2026","Brad Zelnick","Thank you. That\u2019s actually helped.","Mark Garrett","The only thing I would add to that Brad is in Q4, we did have holiday promos, especially around photography to drive adoption in advance of the holidays. And in Q1, we really did not have any of that. So we didn\u2019t have much from a promo perspective in Q1 driving units.","Brad Zelnick","That\u2019s helpful. And if I can just slip in one quick follow-up. Mark, I think, you see it in the release or in your comments, but especially in light of Fotolia closing and the volatility in FX translation and the impact that that has, can you just remind us of your full year targets? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yes. Let me ask you since you brought up FX, let me talk about FX for a couple minutes because it is important. And there\u2019s three considerations that you should consider as it relates to FX, right. One is revenue. Two is the balance sheet and specifically deferred revenue. And then the third is ARR, as it does impact ARR as well. So let me just walk through each of those.","I think I have explained this over the years. We have a hedging program to hedge a portion of our revenue through a cash flow hedging program. So we have revenue and expense in euro, pounds, and yen, as you know and we hedge a large portion of that net position of revenue versus expense in each of those currencies by buying put options. And we hedge a few quarters out at any point in time and we have been doing that for years and you saw it worked very well in Q1 and Q2 -- in Q1 I should say.","Because we hedge a few quarters out in a rate dropping environment, it was minimal impact to our revenue after hedging in Q1 and you saw that in the results. At current rates, I would also expect minimal impact to revenue after hedging in Q2, and that\u2019s factored into the Q2 guidance that I provided. And as we learn more about rates going forward for Q3 and Q4, we will let you know about any potential impact at that time. And as is customary for us, we are not going to update our annual targets at this time.","The second piece is the balance sheet. The deferred revenue balances, the balance on the balance sheet is protected. However, again, in a rate declining environment since deferred revenue balances are made up of activity from as much as a year ago, the deferred revenue that comes off the balance sheet is at a higher rate than the new deferred revenue going onto the balance sheet. So the rate drop does have an impact to net new increases to deferred revenue.","And then the last piece is ARR. So as you know, we report ARR in constant currency from the rate at the start of the year. And as you know, we revalued our year ending \u201814 ARR based on December '14 rates. But when you compare Q1 of '15 net new ARR to Q1 of '14 net new ARR, it\u2019s a similar situation to deferred where in the '14 net new ARR, you would be building that up at a higher rate and that lowers the reported year-over-year growth. So it\u2019s likely had a mid-single-digit impact on year-over-year net new ARR growth in Digital Media. So that\u2019s kind of a mouthful, but I know there\u2019s going to be a lot of questions on FX and hopefully that clears it up.","Brad Zelnick","No. That\u2019s very helpful. And just on the full year targets and I\u2019ll leave it here after this. The 5.9 million Creative subs and I know that\u2019s only one piece of a much bigger story, but everybody seems to focus on it, that still stands and you still feel confident in that for the year?","MarkGarrett","So again, Brad, we customarily do not update annual guidance after Q1 and we\u2019re not doing that today. But as Shantanu said, we\u2019re happy with how we did in Q1 and it\u2019s consistent with our expectations.","Brad Zelnick","Thank you so much.","Shantanu Narayen","Next question please.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill","Hi. Good afternoon. On the marketing side, number continues to do very well. I\u2019m just curious when you look at the percentage of the revenue that is perpetual now versus recurring. Can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing going forward in that line? And I know it was seasonal in Q1 when you called for that and anything else we should think about as we\u2019re modeling that up for the year.","MarkGarrett","Yes. Brent, as we said, towards the end of last year, we\u2019ve kind of gotten to the point where the perpetual number is pretty small. I mean, it\u2019s going to bounce around a little bit based on customer preference, but it's not. It's not a material number anymore and it's not going to swing the revenue that much anymore. So we feel good about the fact that that has transitions into a more ratable model now.","Brent Thill","Okay. And the follow-up for Shantanu on Document Cloud, I know there is pieces of this that you had and somewhat of a re-brand. Can you just give us a sense of maybe what\u2019s new at a high level and what opportunity you think this can unlock? Now, it seems that you\u2019re a more focused on this than perhaps in the past.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Brent. I mean, I think the fundamental issue is that the need to manage documents and document workflows is actually increasing rather than decreasing. And we have this incredible franchise when we think about both the reader, distribution that we have across virtually every device, the fact that we've distributed over a billion of them. And the fact that PDF has been accepted as the de facto standard for documents.","So when you put that together and you consider the massive shift that's happening from paper to digital, we just think we have a really unique opportunity to convert paper documents to this high-quality PDF that you can edit, you can auto populate, you can fill forms, you can send for signatures and more.","And so what we announced today was as part of the Document Cloud Acrobat DC, which is a completely re-imagined user experience far more simple, far more intuitive, we've aligned all of the product offerings from Acrobat to reader to standard, all associated with Acrobat DC. And then the other thing we've done is a huge focus on mobility, so we\u2019ve designed Acrobat DC to be touch enabled and work seamlessly across devices.","These signatures are now part of every subscription of Acrobat DC and we think that integrating documents across other systems like Office 365 as well as other storage providers we've added significant more value. And so we just feel like this is a large opportunity, it\u2019s ours to win. And I think when you think about both, what's being used within the Document Cloud, as well as I mentioned earlier, Acrobat within the Creative Cloud, it just continues to be an opportunity that we focus on.","So as we think about the year for Acrobat, we think we will keep revenue relatively consistent with last year, but we will grow ARR quite a bit. And so I think we're excited about that.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley for Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Steve Ashley","Great. I just had maybe my first question on the Marketing Cloud. Just wondering if you had any color around bookings growth you\u2019re seeing there?","Shantanu Narayen","Yeah. Steve, I think, the bookings growth again were in line with targets that we have. As you know, you were there at Summit. Summit was an incredibly successful event for us. It\u2019s -- as we said in the prepared remarks, the largest pipeline growing event for us. I think, we continue to grow our lead in that particular category and our recognized does that. So we\u2019re pleased with what we did in Q1 and continue to be really bullish about the opportunity that Adobe has in the marketing space.","Steve Ashley","Yeah. One other things you guys talked about at the Marketing Event was some of the core services in the Marketing Cloud included assets. And I\u2019m just wondering in terms of the long-term strategy, is there a plan or hope to maybe link that to the Creative Cloud and if there is maybe you could talk about that a little bit?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. I think the core services that you\u2019re alluding to Steve, for the benefit of others on the call, I mean, there are things like what we've introduced with audience manager, the ability to run both campaigns and to have them specific to customer segments, whether you're doing that for your media span, whether you're doing that associated with understanding analytics or targeted campaigns and converting them to paying customers.","With respect to the integration of the Clouds and today I\u2019ll say, three Clouds. One of the things that we continue to view is Asset Management is the core of what you can do between Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud. You saw number of customers talk about how the velocity of content creation is increasing and how the fact that we have integrated, the Clouds help them with that.","So the core service I would say are the Asset Management service that's part of the Marketing Cloud, the ability to run campaigns and overtime you can also look at the audience segmentation.","The other thing, I think, we showed at Summit was the ability to look at an asset as part of the sneak and understand how effective the usage of that asset was creative asset across all campaign. So I think that also give some indication of the innovation that we\u2019re doing in this space.","Steve Ashley","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. Your line is now open.","Brian Wieser","Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I was wondering if you can update us on the backlog for the overall business and separately, I was wondering if there\u2019s any characterizations you can offer on the numbers of customers you have in the Marketing Cloud alone?","MarkGarrett","Hi. It\u2019s Mark. So on unbilled, we only disclose that number with the K at the end of each fiscal year. So, obviously, we would expect that to keep growing, but we don't disclose the number other than at the K.","Shantanu Narayen","And Brian, with respect to the number of Marketing Clouds customers, they are in the thousands. I think the focus on those customers as you know is both with new logo addition, as well as with increased upsell of our existing solutions, but we don't have an update to that number. It is clearly in the thousands and growing well.","Brian Wieser","Okay. Great. And for me just one brief question around Nielsen and your relationship there, just wondering if you could update us on when you expect to see product in the market and any current commentary on relationships, evolution of that product?","Shantanu Narayen","Yeah. Brian, the rational for the partnership that we announced was that, every single advertiser and publisher would like to see consistent cross domain understanding of customers. And since we are clearly the leaders of what\u2019s happening in web analytics and Nielsen is a leader of what\u2019s happening on TV, providing a consistent demographic of who\u2019s viewing what content across what device is something that the two of us can uniquely provide. We are working together. We don\u2019t have an update on exactly when that\u2019s going to be in market. But it\u2019s been received well by publishers and advertisers because they do want that currency to cut across multiple TV screens, multiple screens.","Brian Wieser","Great. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open.","Brendan Barnicle","Thanks so much Mark. In your prepared remarks you mentioned that blend in AR -- blended ARPU across Creative Cloud offerings declines slightly as a result of mix. We\u2019ve seen that for a while now as you\u2019ve had individual product sales. When do you think that starts to bottom out? Are you guys modeling a point where that bottoms out?","Mark Garrett","Yeah. Actually it\u2019s come down this quarter less than it has in recent quarters. So it was a much smaller decline this quarter. So it is conceivable that we are starting to see that now actually.","Shantanu Narayen","Yeah. When we look at it, maybe I\u2019ll just add to that. We found the ARPU very healthy in the quarter. The thing to remember again is the steady state of the creative business for sure what we had was both a mix between the full units as well as individual point units. And I think we\u2019ve stated in the past that if you consider it from a revenue point of view, it was approximately a 70-30 towards the suites. And if you consider it from a units\u2019 point of view is 50-50. And when we rolled out the Creative Cloud, as you know we rolled out the Creative Cloud complete first and then added offerings such as the individual lap offering for team as well as the CCPP offering.","And so all of this is happening in line with our expectations. We are increasing the market for both of those, but the revenue that we see today for Creative Cloud complete as a percentage of the total revenue is higher than what it was with the creative suite offerings. So things are playing out in line with our expectations.","Brendan Barnicle","And Shantanu, at the marketing companies, is it clear you are seeing bigger deals and bigger RFEs. Do you have any commentary of what you seeing on a sort of ARPU over Marketing Cloud side of business?","Shantanu Narayen","Well we don't use the word ARPU there. But in terms of the large deals and the number of transactions greater than $500,000 or $1 million we don't have an update right now. Actually Brad had some data that he put in that datasheet so that does reflect the progress that we are making in multi-solution selling. We are not updating that today over and above what Brad described at the marketing summit, Brendan.","Mark Garrett","And just for reference those are in the slides on our IR site, there's a reference to the summit slides from last week that you can access that information at.","Brendan Barnicle","And then just one last product question Shantanu on the document cloud, I was wondering what you guys are seeing with EchoSign and changes in the competitive landscape there? Thanks. That\u2019s it for me.","Shantanu Narayen","Well, I think with respect to signatures, the demand for signatures the organic demand for signatures and making that paper based workflow move digital. I think we are seeing tremendous demand for that. I think there are a couple of players in that market. I think today's announcement allows us to enable every reader on every device to start to participate in the electronic signature workflow, which we think will be a jumpstart both for us as well as other players in that market. It's going to be a big market and it's going to take years by the time we get all of the approval.","So I think everybody is going to see a significant amount of growth. And there are other competitors as you point out. But we really like what footprint we have right now and the offering that we have in the market.","Brendan Barnicle","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler at Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Mark Moerdler","Thanks. This is Mark Moerdler. So quick questions, do you believe the FX has had any impact on subscriber\u2019s adoption in any of these regions. Do you think you\u2019ve seen anything slower in terms of the mix of subscribers? And was the FX itself a larger impact on creative than other divisions? Then I have got a quick follow-up.","Mark Garrett","I mean the net to both of those questions is no. I don't think it has any impact on customer adoption and the FX is going to be skewed towards where revenue is by currency and that's not going to be much different for creative versus other pieces of the business really.","Shantanu Narayen","Mark, just to, again clarify, both all of the individual offerings, team continued to do well in the quarter. We had a strong quarter for team, as it related to Creative Cloud subscriptions. And again, I do want to repeat that the Acrobat subscriptions in the quarter, virtually every one of them went against the Document Cloud ARR as opposed to the Creative ARR but it is reflected in the Digital Media ARR.","Mark Moerdler","So is that going to then -- is that a long-term impact? In other words, are we going to see more of those subscribers float over? I know you\u2019ve guided to a number in terms of subscribers for the year, but overall should we see that as a long-term gain that those pick ups are going to occur on the document side?","Shantanu Narayen","No, I think we were experimenting this time, as it related to the Document Cloud launch. I think we continue to think that there's a tremendous headroom in the Creative Cloud install base that we will continue to drive towards. And we remain confident about the long-term subscriber numbers as well, that we will continue to drive in Creative. But I think, this time we wanted to reflect that you see that strength more on the Document ARR than the creative ARR.","Mark Garrett","And that mix -- that mix, Mark, would\u2019ve been factored into the 5.9 when we guided.","Mark Moerdler","Okay. And one another quick one, does the Document Cloud drive any change in revenue recognition license versus subscription?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, we certainly have subscription as an offering right now. That subscription offering for Acrobat has been there for a while. We continue to believe that as you -- the migration will not happen the way the Creative Cloud migration happened. So, we've said that revenue we expect to be in the Document Cloud business relatively flat for the year but ARR to grow well.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks. Good evening. Mark, question for you first. Regarding the revenue profile in parts of your business, particularly marketing cloud because that is -- you have a mix in some cases of platform access revenues and then you have a large mix of course of usage based or transactional based revenue. Could you talk about how you think that mix might evolve both in the marketing cloud side of the business and perhaps in the other sides of the business, Creative Cloud or doc services in terms of platform and usage based revenue and then a follow-up? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","If I understand you correctly, Jay, I mean for the most part, it\u2019s all usage based. I mean, some of it is specifically tied to usage numbers every single quarter. Some of it is based on an annual usage number. But for the most part, it is usage-based revenue kind of oriented.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Okay. On the Creative Cloud subs add number, two things you mentioned last week at Summit that you have 5 million trial users signed up from your player downloads. How are you thinking about converting those to paying subscribers? And in terms of another potentially very long source of subscriber add, particularly for DSLR. How are you thinking about converting the old element space to subscription? I would think that the package full of elements would have over the years generated several millions at least of nominal users, so how are you thinking about converting them?","Shantanu Narayen","It\u2019s a good question, Jay. I think both the millions of elements customers that we have, as well as the over 30 million Acrobat units that are out there, both represent an install base that we will consider moving to the appropriate subscription offering.","So more specifically to your question about elements, the elements base, certainly we believe a better migration path for them moving forward is the Creative Cloud Photography.","Both the elements base, as well as the trial users, we have a very carefully constructed campaign to continue to your target them and have them move over from being trial users to being paid subscribers of the Creative Cloud and we will continue to execute against that opportunity.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","All right. Just one more if I may, Mark, your Q1 cash flow was relatively low or lower than Q1 last year anyway? In spite of that just given the revenue staffing of various subscription businesses and margin expansion that you will likely see this year, were there the reason that your operating cash flow should probably meet or beat $2 billion for fiscal \u201915?","Mark Garrett","So I am not going to guide to a total number for the year, Jay. But suffice it to say that this is a low quarter coming off of Q4 with all the payments that we make in Q1 and it\u2019s going to back very nicely through the rest of the year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from line of Jennifer Lowe at Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you. I wanted to touch quickly on the reseller channel and in particularly in Q3 there was little bit of air pocket there given the pulling out of perpetual but seemed like that came back pretty strongly in Q4? Do you think the reseller channel is now kind of stable where you like to see it at this point?","Shantanu Narayen","Yeah. I feel good, Jennifer, about how the reseller channel is also focused on the Creative Cloud opportunity and how they're executing against it. They are certainly targeting the installed base and helping them migrate from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud. So we feel good about it around the world.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. And then just one for, Mark, this is the second quarter in a row, where expense growth -- operating expense growth has been less than a percent, which is pretty impressive given, especially how you are investing in the Marketing Cloud? I guess, two questions, one is, how much of that, or maybe really just one question, how much of that is upward figure proactively making trading costs versus something more tactical like FX?","Mark Garrett","It\u2019s not FX. We manage the cost structure the company very, very carefully. We've always been very good at that frankly. We've got the money we need to invest in the business. We\u2019ve got the sales capacity we need to invest in the Digital Marketing business. That OpEx number, you are going to see it start to grow.","Now as we go through the year, don't forget when you come off of Q4, there's a lot of additional comp expense for sales commissions and things that you have in Q4 that you don't have in Q1. So that's a big reason for what you see between Q4, Q1. But it will ramp as we go through the rest of the year and you'll see that based on the guidance for the year that we had provided.","Jennifer Lowe","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Samad Samana","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to touch base on Fotolia with the acquisition that closed? Could you remind us how many subscribers they have and could you share any data on the overlap between their subscriber base and who is using the Creative Cloud already?","Shantanu Narayen","We have not provided their subscriber base numbers. What we have provided is the overall market available opportunities. So, we've said, when you consider all of services, it\u2019s approximately a $4 billion. We have also shared everything over 90% of the people who contribute stock content, use our tools and over 80% of those who buy that stock content use various tools.","And strategically, what you should think about it is that the integration is on track. We will continue to offer as a standalone service the two models that Fotolia had namely on-demand model as well as a subscription model for stock photos as well as we will introduce new offerings, which includes Creative Cloud and stock offering. So that's conceptually how you should think about it. When it's introduced into the market, we\u2019ll certainly provide more details.","Samad Samana","Okay. And if I could ask one more on the Creative Cloud side of the business. Historically, you provided a mix between point products and full suite numbers. You didn\u2019t break that mix out this quarter. Could you give us an idea if there is any type of meaningful change directionally between the mix that you\u2019d seen over the last few quarters and this quarter and that\u2019s my last question?","Mark Garrett","It\u2019s Mark. It\u2019s 59% full.","Samad Samana","Okay. Great. Thanks for that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard at Citi. Your line is now open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Thanks. Mark, I\u2019m just wondering as we think about seasonality this year on the subscriber side. You put the line in the mark that you would expect subscribers to grow each quarter. It seem like did you step up a meaningful year -- more meaningfully during some of these quarter at $5.9 million and I\u2019m wondering with this experimentation in Q1 that it sounds like it\u2019s about to continue in Q2. Should we expect that there is sort of step back up from Q1 and Q2 with some of the Acrobat stuff coming back into the Creative Cloud market?","Mark Garrett","So yes, there will be a step-up from Q1 to Q2. It wouldn\u2019t just be from Acrobat. It would be a natural step-up as we march towards that $5.9 million that we had guided to but definitely a step-up from Q1 and Q2.","Shantanu Narayen","And Walter, the other thing as you are aware is as we continue to rollout the innovation roadmap that also continues to get people who are on CS6 of prior versions moved over to the Creative Cloud. So that will continue as well.","Walter Pritchard","And I have just one follow-up. Last year, you had a sort of discrete events with the major launch midyear and then in Q3, you saw basically cleared lot of the point products, the package products and they started selling. That seemed like that was a bit of a shocking arm for the subscribers\u2019 growth numbers during the year. As we looks at this year, is there anything like that we should be aware of that would impact our seasonality other than from the fact that you addressed there?","Mark Garrett","We\u2019re not announcing products but, Walter, I think to the question that you asked you can expect that we\u2019re going to be coming out with a fair amount of innovation. And if you look at our historical delivery, delivering something again in a few months would be consistent with what we've done last year, yes.","Walter Pritchard","Okay. Thanks very much.","Mike Saviage","Operator, while we take -- operator, we\u2019ll take two more questions.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt Williams at Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Matt Williams","Hi guys, sitting in for Kirk Materne. Thanks for taking the question. Just maybe if you could provide a little bit of color on sort of how you are thinking about the reacceleration of Marketing Cloud revenues throughout the remainder of the year given that you are lapping the anniversary of deferring more of the experienced manager campaign revenue?","Mark Garrett","Yeah. I mean, we had -- as you know, we had guided to 25% revenue growth for the year. We start out the year here with 17%. It definitely ramps the growth from a year-over-year perspective. We will ramp pretty much every quarter as we get up to Q4 to get to that 25%.","Matt Williams","Okay, great. And I mean this but did you guys give up booking growth rate for the Marketing Cloud for quarter?","Mark Garrett","Now we did not. We don't disclose the bookings growth rates every quarter. We just said -- Shantanu had mentioned that we had a good quarter.","Matt Williams","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Derrick Wood at Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open.","Derrick Wood","Thanks. Last week, you guys talked about the TAM for the photography market being significantly higher than the traditional creative products and now you\u2019ve got a more strategic cloud focus on document side. So have you guys done the work to kind of update the total user TAM and the Digital Media segment?","Shantanu Narayen","We certainly have a lot of data on what's happened with the Acrobat segment as well. And I think to Jay\u2019s question earlier, as well in terms of what the available opportunity is for us to attract customers who previously brought elements that is -- I think at max, you can expect us to continue to give you an update on what's available as a total available market. We are not certainly providing that level of detail on our earnings call, Derrick.","Mark Garrett","And Derrick, you could also watch the slides from the past that have also disclosed some of that, so I\u2019ll be happy to follow-up later on where we will discuss sort of the Document Services TAM and related addressable markets.","Derrick Wood","Okay. And then on the -- you guys mentioned that ETLA pipelines are building nicely and I suspect ETLAs were seasonally softer in Q1, as is typical. Can you just remind us as what kind of seasonality you typically see throughout the year and then, whether do you think the Document Cloud will help drive some kind of incremental strength in the size of ETLA?","Shantanu Narayen","So, ETLA is typically, as you\u2019ve seen historically, Q4 tends to be a seasonally very strong quarter. Q1 does, as you point out, tend to be a weak quarter and then it starts to build up and so we expect to -- as Mark also said in the prepared remarks see a sequential increase. And to your other question, there is no doubt in our mind that what we're seeing is, as we have multiple offerings that are targeting an enterprise, our ability to sell higher into the organization and sell more complete solutions is increasing. And from that point of view, the availability of the document offerings will only help the fact that we have creative offerings, as well as we have marketing offering. So, I think all of those with the announcement of the Document Cloud should be positive.","Derrick Wood","All right. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Since that's a last question, maybe I will just recap and say, we're proud of what we accomplished in Q1 and the strong start that we had to fiscal \u201815. It was a strong revenue, as well as EPS quarter. We drove strong Digital Media ARR and had a very successful Summit that we organized in Utah. We announced the new Document Cloud this morning and the reception to that has also been extremely positive.","Fotolia integration is on track. We will make available the Document Cloud to our customers also this quarter. And so we feel like we're in great shape and we remain focused on driving both product innovation, as well as strong financial results for the rest of fiscal \u201815 as well as beyond. Thank you for joining us today.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call."],"466":["Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) Q2 2015 Earnings Conference Call  June 16, 2015  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mike Saviage - VP, Investor Relations","Shantanu Narayen - President and Chief Executive Officer","Mark Garrett \u2013 EVP and Chief Financial Officer","David Wadhwani - SVP and General Manager, Digital Media ","Analysts","Walter Pritchard - Citi","Brent Thill - UBS","Brad Zelnick - Jefferies","Kash Rangan - BofA Merril Lynch","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan ","Ross MacMillan - RBC Capital Markets","Kirk Materne - Evercore ISI ","Mark Moerdler - Bernstein","Philip Winslow - Credit Suisse ","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Steve Ashley - Robert W.

I would like to welcome you to Adobe Systems Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Ian and I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO; and David Wadhwani, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Digital Media. ","In the call today, we will discuss Adobe's second quarter fiscal year 2015 financial results. We will also review announcements made earlier today regarding our latest Creative Cloud release, and our new Adobe Stock offering. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release which crossed the wire approximately one hour ago. We've also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, our financial targets and an updated investor datasheet on www.adobe.com. If you would like a copy of these documents, you can go to the Investor Relations page and find them listed under Quick Links. ","Before we get started, we want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets, and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, June 16th, 2015, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the Forward-Looking Statements Disclosure in the earnings press release and financial targets document we issued today as well as Adobe's SEC filings. ","During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the two is available in our financial targets document and in our updated investor datasheet on Adobe's Investor Relations website.","Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being webcast live in Adobe Connect, and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe's Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded, or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe. ","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu. ","Shantanu Narayen ","Adobe delivered strong results in Q2 with revenue of $1.162 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.48. Momentum across our Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Marketing Cloud businesses drove these results. ","As digital continues to disrupt industries, Adobe is uniquely positioned to help brands, media companies, government agencies and educational institutions create digital experiences that are unique, relevant, and effective across every touch point. We are the only company with the vision and assets to address the entire content lifecycle \u2013 from creation and delivery to optimization and monetization. We are accelerating the pace of innovation in each of our Cloud offerings and customers are looking to us to provide a complete, integrated platform for their digital transformation. ","Adobe Marketing Cloud is the industry's most comprehensive offering. We had strong bookings in Q2 and reported revenue of $327 million, representing 15% year-over-year growth. ","We continued to drive Adobe Marketing Cloud adoption across all eight solutions in Q2 and saw a significant uptick in customers acquiring multiple solutions. In fact, two thirds of our top customers this quarter licensed multiple solutions. Key customer wins included Saks & Co, The Gap, DirecTV, Fox Entertainment and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. The breadth of Adobe Marketing Cloud has been extended with two new solutions, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Primetime. Adobe Audience Manager is a data management platform that integrates online and offline data enabling marketers to create and target audience segments in their multi-channel campaigns. Adobe Primetime is a multiscreen TV platform that helps broadcasters, cable networks and service providers create and monetize engaging and personalized TV and film experiences. Primetime has emerged as the global leader in powering TV content across screens, including over-the-top devices such as Apple TV and Roku, and we're partnering with content owners, programmers and pay-TV providers such as Major League Baseball Advanced Media to offer innovative programming across all screens. ","The integration of the creative and marketing workflow is a unique differentiator for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q2, we announced a common asset management foundation across Adobe Marketing Cloud and Creative Cloud, which will make it easier and more efficient for creative and marketing teams to work together.","In Q2, we acquired Tumri's advertising technology to add dynamic creative optimization to Adobe Media Optimizer, extending Adobe's lead in the programmatic advertising space. We continue to build a vibrant ecosystem of industry partners for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q2, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to integrate Adobe Marketing Cloud into Microsoft's Dynamics CRM to help enterprises better engage with customers.","Our Digital Marketing events around the world provide inspiration, education and networking opportunities for leading brands and marketers around the world. In Q2, the Digital Marketing Summits in Salt Lake City, London, and New Delhi were all sold out, and this summer, we will host thousands more at our Digital Marketing Symposia in Sydney and Singapore. ","Industry analysts continue to recognize our solutions as market-leading in their categories. In April, Gartner recognized Adobe's leadership in its 2015 Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management. ","In Digital Media, we launched the Document Cloud in March and early response has been positive. We saw strong Acrobat DC subscription uptake during the quarter. As the paper-to-digital transition continues, Adobe has a tremendous opportunity to capitalize on our leadership with the PDF and Acrobat franchise. Document Cloud features new mobile and touch capabilities and has built-in electronic signature tools for all users.","We reported Document Cloud revenue of $197 million in Q2, and exited the quarter with $329 million of Document Cloud Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR.","Creative Cloud continues to be the preeminent destination for creatives. We are migrating customers from our Creative Suite installed base as well as attracting new users. In Q2, Creative ARR surpassed the $2 billion mark, driven by strong adoption across our Individual, Team and Enterprise offerings. Net new Creative Cloud subscriptions grew by 639,000 in the quarter to over 4.6 million and represent 38% year-over-year growth. ","Across our Creative and Document Cloud businesses, total Digital Media ARR grew to $2.35 billion as of the end of Q2. Today, we launched our 2015 release of Creative Cloud, featuring innovation in desktop and mobile apps, and Creative Sync technology to enable seamless integration between the two. We unveiled Adobe Stock, a new service that enables creatives to buy and sell stock content as part of the Creative Cloud experience.","Now I would like to turn it over to David to provide an update on our Creative Cloud strategy and more details on today's announcements. David?","David Wadhwani","Thanks, Shantanu. Our Creative Cloud strategy focuses on three growth drivers: The continued migration of Creative Suite customers to Creative Cloud; the expansion of our market through tiered offerings that attract new customers; and the introduction of value-added services that increase ARPU. We are executing well in each of these areas. ","Our strategy to migrate Creative Suite customers to Creative Cloud is working. We are delivering constant innovation in our Creative Cloud desktop apps, we are expanding our family of connected mobile apps, and we are delivering powerful, integrated asset management capabilities that connect our mobile and desktop app workflows. These cross device workflows are resonating with our customers and have been improving both trial conversion and customer retention. ","In addition to migration, we are successfully attracting new customers to Creative Cloud through our family of mobile apps and the Creative Cloud Photography Plan. In Q2, we delivered a milestone release of CCP featuring a simplified user experience and new mobile features. CCP is ideal for all photographers and a large percentage of the subscribers are first time Adobe customers. ","Finally, we remain focused on expanding the value of Creative Cloud through services that drive stickiness, conversion and increased ARPU. Today's introduction of Adobe Stock builds on our Creative Marketplace and represents an estimated $3 billion of incremental addressable market.","Now, I'm happy to share a bit about today's 2015 release of Creative Cloud. The release includes major updates to all our flagship desktop apps including significant breakthroughs in productivity, performance and new features. We also updated our family of mobile apps across iPhone, iPad and now for the first time, Android. And we announced significant updates to CreativeSync, the technology that enables our mobile and desktop apps to work together seamlessly. The combination of these capabilities unlocks new creative workflows that will motivate CS customers to upgrade, and drive active use and retention of existing members. ","Enterprise customers will benefit from all the new Creative Cloud features. In addition, they will get expanded security options and deeper connections between Creative Cloud and our Digital Publishing and Marketing Cloud offerings. Finally, we're introducing Adobe Stock, a brand new service based on our acquisition of Fotolia. We estimate that 85% of Creatives who buy stock content use Adobe tools, and more than 90% of stock content sellers use Adobe software in the preparation of their photos and images. Adobe Stock is the first stock marketplace embedded into the way creatives work. Deep integration with our Creative Cloud desktop apps including Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign makes buying and using stock photos, images and illustrations incredibly easy. ","The global launch of Adobe Stock shakes up the multi-billion dollar stock content market. Customers can buy images on demand or as part of a subscription plan. Most importantly, existing and new Creative Cloud members are also able to add Adobe Stock to their subscription plan at a special rate driving increased ARPU over time.","Adobe Stock extends the value of Creative Cloud to subscribers who want to monetize their assets and participate in a large, global Creative Marketplace.","In just a few short years, we have successfully re-imagined the entire creative process driving over $2 billion of ARR. Today's announcements significantly advance all three of our growth objectives. We're excited this innovation is now available to all our subscribers and we can't wait to see what they do with it. Mark?","Mark Garrett","In the second quarter of FY15, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.162 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.29 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.48. Highlights in our second quarter include, growing Creative ARR to $2.02 billion exiting Q2. ARR has now grown to the point where it has exceeded the peak annual revenue achieved from our legacy Creative Suite perpetual offering. Achieving total Digital Media ARR of $2.35 billion which is the sum of Creative ARR plus another strong quarter of Document Cloud ARR growth; delivering Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $327 million; showing leverage in our model, with strong year-over-year growth in operating and net income; growing deferred revenue to a record $1.23 billion; achieving strong cash flow from operations of $471 million, and exiting Q2 with a record 72% recurring revenue. ","In Digital Media, we achieved revenue of $748 million. This segment has two major components of revenue, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. The best overall measure of the health of our creative business is Creative ARR, and we grew ARR by $230 million during Q2. Net new Creative Cloud subscriptions increased by 639,000 thousand, and we exited Q2 with 4,610,000 Creative Cloud subscriptions. Retention rates remain strong. With our Document Cloud products, we achieved revenue of $197 million. The benefits of subscription and Enterprise Term Licensing Agreements, or ETLAs, which is a core go-to-market focus with our new Document Cloud offering that shipped during the quarter, helped to grow Document Cloud ARR to a record $329 million exiting Q2. ","In our Digital Marketing segment there are two components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and we achieved Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $327 million, up 15% year-over-year. Bookings accelerated in Q2, driven by strong pipeline creation at our Digital Marketing Summit user conferences across the world during the quarter. Multi-solution adoption is growing the size of customer engagements. The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses, which contributed $40 million in Q2 revenue consistent with our expectations. ","Print and Publishing segment revenue was $48 million in Q2. Geographically, we experienced stable demand across our major geographies. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $16 million. We had $22 million in hedge gains in Q2, FY15, versus $24 million in hedge gains in Q1, FY15, thus the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $18 million. ","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $48 million. Considering the $22 million in hedge gains in Q2, FY15, versus roughly $2 million in hedge gains in Q2, FY14, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $28 million. In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 18.5% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted primarily due to tax benefits recognized as a result of the completion of certain tax examinations. Employees at the end of Q2, including summer interns, totaled 13,266 versus 12,698 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 39 days which compares to 45 days in the year-ago quarter and 44 days last quarter. ","Cash flow from operations was $471 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.23 billion, up 32% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.41 billion compared to $3.18 billion at the end of Q1. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $200 million, of which $133 million was done under the new $2 billion authorization approved by our Board of Directors in January, 2015. ","Now, I would like to provide our financial outlook, covering both Q3 as well as the rest of FY15. ","We have executed well in the first half of FY15 meeting or exceeding key targets that we set at the outset of the year and we expect our momentum to continue in the second half of this year and into FY16. Adobe has a global business, where currently more than 40% of our revenue comes from outside the U.S. As we've explained, our hedging efforts focus on three quarters out and that strategy has served us well over time. Based on the rolling approach of our hedging program, our hedges maturing in the second half of FY15 and early FY16 were struck at current rates. Therefore moving forward our hedges will not mitigate the FX impact against our FY15 and FY16 revenue targets provided in December 2014.","With the strengthening US dollar on a revenue weighted average basis, FX rates have moved approximately 9% from December of 2014 until today. We expect approximately $900 million of foreign currency denominated revenue in the second half of FY15. Applying the 9% rate change to the expected $900 million of revenue yields an estimated $80 million of impact due to FX that we expect will not be offset by hedging. We estimate $30 million of this impact will occur in our third quarter. Our FY15 annual revenue target was $4.925 billion. This revenue target was the sum of our original guidance of $4.85 billion in December plus the additional $75 million of expected FY15 revenue from our acquisition of Fotolia in January. ","We are now targeting FY15 annual revenue of $4.845 billion, solely due to the estimated $80 million impact of FX in the second half of FY15. We also expect second half year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud reported revenue growth of approximately 24%. Given our business momentum, we are increasing our Digital Media ARR target to approximately $2.925 billion exiting FY15, which as a reminder is measured on a constant currency basis. This updated ARR target does not include any benefit from our newly launched Adobe Stock service. ","Despite the impact of currency, we continue to expect Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings growth of approximately 30% for the year and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.05.Taking into account the negative impact of $30 million from FX, in Q3 of FY15 we are targeting a revenue range of $1.175 billion to $1.225 billion. ","In Q3, we expect the sequential increase in Digital Media ARR to be similar to what we achieved in Q2; we expect Digital Media segment revenue to grow sequentially and we expect approximately 21% year-over-year reported revenue growth for Adobe Marketing Cloud. We are targeting our Q3 share count to be 506 million to 508 million shares. We are targeting net non-operating expense to be between $14 million and $16 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of approximately 25% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis.","These targets yield Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.23 to $0.29 per share, and Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.45 to $0.51. ","In summary, our strong execution continued in Q2 and Adobe's P&L now reflects the positive impact from the growth of our Cloud-enabled solutions. ","Mike?","Mike Saviage ","Thanks Mark.

","We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Walter Pritchard at Citi. Your line is open. ","Walter Pritchard","Hi, thanks. We might prefer David talked about the Fotolia opportunity for ARPU and that makes lot of sense. I am wondering if you could just talk a bit about ARPU trends during the quarter and we noticed from a promotional perspective you've added some stuff at the end of the quarter which we've seen and haven't resumed that, could you put that in the context of how should we think about ARPU here as we move through the second half of the year? ","Mark Garrett","Hey, Walter. It's Mark. Sure, so as it relates to promotions, I think we told you on the last quarter call in Q1 we did not have a lot of promotions in the quarter, very, very little. This also was a quarter where we had very little promotional activities. So we are really pleased with the amount of net new subscribers we are driving without a lot of promotional activity. That doesn't suggest that we won't do them in the future but the fact that we are driving a lot of net new subscribers without it right now is a very good sign. As it relates to ARPU, we had the smallest sequential decline we had in quite a long time. So we are very happy with ARPU as we've continued to say ARPU by offering continues to remain stable or increase and the average of all of the ARPUs this quarter dropped very, very slightly and again it was the smallest decline we had in several quarters. ","Shantanu Narayen ","Also, Walter, with respect to Adobe Stock just to clarify, as David said in his prepared remarks, you can if you are a Creative Cloud subscriber add a subscription for Adobe Stock and you can also as a new subscriber subscribe to both Creative Cloud applications as well as Adobe Stock. Both of those will be reflected in the ARR numbers that we report on a going quarterly basis. I wanted to clarify for everybody listening on the call that the standalone subscription for just Adobe Stock is not reported at this point in the Creative Cloud numbers. ","Mark Garrett","And we would likely not add that until 2016, FY16. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill","Thanks, Shantanu, C6 just past, it is three year birthday and I am curious that basis is fairly large and what you've seen so far in the CS6 base now converting over to Creative Cloud and I had a quick follow up with Mark just it relates to Japan. What you saw in the quarter? And any trends there would be helpful.","Shantanu Narayen ","Sure. So, Brent, as you point out CS6 is definitely long in the -- with today's CC2015 release, the innovation that we are providing as well as the integration with the services makes it even older. We still have a fairly large CS6 base which clearly represents upside opportunity for us to convert to the Creative Cloud. As you are aware in Japan that was the market where we were selling CS6 till even late last year. And so we continue to target CS5 and CS6 as the most likely installed base to convert to CC. They are converting; the innovation is definitely resonating with them. And that continues to be the focus for David and his group. ","Mark Garrett","I think Shantanu touched upon Japan so I don't have anything to add. ","Brent Thill","And Mark just a quick follow up maybe on the DSO, it was 39 days, we had to go back six years in the model, was that just a subscription model kind or was there -- is there something about lean area in the quarter that surprised you.","Mark Garrett","There is nothing that really surprises us. It is definitely related to the subscription model. Team does a great job on a collection front as well. It is going to move around as you go through quarters and you have various linearity and deal sizes but we've always been, as you know historically very good at driving a low DSO. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks for taking my question. On Creative Cloud, can you give us an update on the mix of point products versus full suite subscription and particularly with the strength in the home products the past several quarters which seemed to be accretive to the model? Can you update us with even a directional sense of how many users you are attracting that are net new and where are they coming from? ","Shantanu Narayen ","Sure. So, Brad, I'll go ahead and take that. I think the mix in the second quarter of 2015 was 56% was complete as well as 44% was single app. We are certainly -- we saw strength across the board. The momentum of subscriptions if you look at 630,000 plus subscriptions that we had, 38% growth we are seeing, good momentum across each one of them as we've mentioned in the past the Creative Cloud photography is certainly attracting a significant number of new customers and the overall new customer adds continues to be greater than 20%. So we are continued to be pleased with what we are seeing on Creative Cloud adoption. ","Brad Zelnick","Thanks. If I could just sneak in a quick one for Mark, OpEx looks like it is guided up 5% sequentially in Q3. Other than the seasonal hires of the summer interns which look like headcount is also up similar percentage sequentially. Is there anything else that we should be thinking about seasonally and where do you expect headcount for the full year? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yes. I mean the bulk of the increase in OpEx as you look out from here is really going to be driven by sales and marketing. Interns don't drive it that much. The regular hires in the quarter were about 350 and there were couple hundred interns in this quarter. But the OpEx moving forward is really going to be driven continued investment in sales and marketing to drive that 30% bookings growth that we need to do in digital marketing and obviously the ETLAs in digital media as well. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merril Lynch. Your line is now open.","Kash Rangan","Hi, guys. Thank you. You made an observation that the creative business is finally at the point where it was roughly comparable to the size of the creative business the licensed model, yet you have only 4.6 million subscribers in your base. It feels like the overall opportunity is at least only one third penetrated, maybe -- and maybe even less so. So what are the opportunities to be able to triple the size of your creative business given that you got about one third penetration off your old base, opportunities and challenges consequentially as well as you try to triple the size of the business, is that to say a possibility, and also wanted to ascertain from you what realistic attach rate should we expect for the stock business given your base of creative pros is about 6 million - 6.7 million, I think that's the data that I have from your analyst day a couple of years back. Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen ","Yes. So, Kash, I think you are alluding to the numbers that we've given in terms of the Creative Suites installed base being over 12 million and clearly the innovation that David and his group are driving and I'll then ask him to add color on the specific features. We'll certainly continue to help drive new, migrate the existing CS customers into the Creative Cloud option. The addition of the new services are certainly continuing to attract a brand new set of customers that's expanding the overall installed base as we continue to target creatives both in the imaging space and with a number of the mobile applications, what we are doing to increase the size of the funnel which again is adding to the available opportunity that we have in that particular market. And I think Stock is a little bit early in terms of the rollout, but again I think David has talked about what percentage of people both buy and sell using Adobe tools and that represent an opportunity. ","David Wadhwani","Sure. Let me add a couple of things to that. First of all, the announcements that we had with the 2015 release were very broad based. We had major enhancements to our desktop applications and their mobile applications on IOS and we also for the first time introduced the mobile applications on Android. So we feel that that's going to have a broader play as well. Additionally, we made some significant updates to the Creative Sync Technology that moves assets across the desktop and mobile application to enable them to work as a single family. And of course we introduced the Adobe Stock in addition to some very visible changes that we made to the desktop applications around touch which is one of the big drivers that we believe in terms of CS4, CS5 and CS6 customers coming to the platform. A couple of things to call out in terms of what we are seeing in terms of the new capabilities and how that's driving existing customer behavior. A lot of the existing enhancements we've made to mobile applications are having significant driving on both the migration and also on new customers coming into the family. So as you noted and as we've talked about in the past, the mobile applications have been around for about a year and what we are seeing is that they are driving increased conversion of people filing the products. We see that they are increasing retention of paid numbers that are using -- that have been using the products. And we see that they are driving additional creation of Adobe ID, so we are seeing more Adobe IDs created as a result of mobile first interaction with Creative Cloud than ever before and I\u2019d characterize the conversion of those mobile IDs to paid customers as generally strong. So we are very happy with how all of that has been playing out in the ecosystem. ","Kash Rangan","So conceptually I want to make sure I am not making a mistake here. The ARPU is going to lift and the TAM is actually larger than the old base which means in the new world you only have to give revenue guidance but it feels like your creative business could be multiples of what it was in the prior to this model transition. But I just add up your comments. ","Shantanu Narayen ","Yes, Kash. I mean the whole strategy around the Creative Cloud was to reimagine the creative process, make it far more predictable and we definitely thought to increase significantly the size of the market opportunity. I think one measure that you can see even today of how successful we\u2019ve already been is the fact that we've talked about how we used to sell approximately 3 million units in the past and now if you look at what we are doing with this 4.6 million subscribers and in addition to that all of the enterprise deals that we have, we've already dramatically I think increased the size of the available opportunity. One last thing I might add in addition to what David and I said, the enterprise also represents an opportunity with this particular release. We've some very significant functionality that will enable enterprises to store all of their assets from behind the firewall and so continuing to focus on ETLAs and migrating enterprise customers with this new product I think represents an untapped opportunity. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Wondering in terms tell us around the Marketing Cloud in terms of the revenue growth in particular how much of the new target this year is impacted just by the FX versus anything else is going on. And just as a quick follow up, Mark, any sense of what's EPS on a third quarter for FX looks like?","Mark Garrett","Sure, Sterling. So on the Marketing Cloud as we said booking remains very strong. In fact, I am sure you caught that we are not changing that 30% bookings outlook despite the impact to currency which obviously suggest that we would have done better than 30% without the change in FX rate. So FX is clearly impacting bookings, it is clearly impacting the marketing revenue growth. We've always felt that the marketing revenue growth would accelerate in the back half of the year. And that's why I mentioned that the second half would grow 24% year-over-year. So we are still seeing really strong growth in marketing despite currency, but there is no doubt that currency has an impact on that revenue growth rate just like the rest of the business. And then as it relates to EPS, Sterling, I mean it is pretty straight forward. We said that FX was impacting Q3 by about $30 million. So if you do the rough math, you are going to get to around $0.04 to $0.06 of earnings impact in the third quarter as a result of that $30 million but like we said we are still confident in the in the $2.05 again despite the impact of $80 million worth of currency in the back half of the year. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Market. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Yes, thanks a lot. Hey, Mark, just wanted to ask you on the subs. I know you are focused on ARR but earlier in the year you talked about sequential and pieces in the sub add -- to this year, so just curious whether you still expect sequential increases in 3Q, 4Q and the $5.9 million target for the year and then just on -- I had one specific one for David on Fotolia regarding the contributor payout, it looks like you said 33% payout and I just want to get a sense of whether that was new-- whether that was an increase of the payout to the contributors still we have -- Thanks. ","Mark Garrett","Hey, Ross, Yes, so as you know we've always said for a four years now that ARR is really the best measure of the health of the business. And the sub number is an incomplete number because it doesn't include enterprise and as we add future offerings like Adobe Stock, looking at that sub number gets I think less and less meaningful over time. But everything is encompassed in that ARR number. That's obviously going very well, that's why we've raised our guidance on the ARR number and we had a great sub quarter. We are thrilled with the sub quarter and we continue to report sub actuals. But we are not going to guide on the sub number moving forward. That said our annual expectations really have not changed. We need that $5.9 million sub number to hit the increased ARR target, and clearly with the performance we've had today we are on the path to meet or exceed that $5.9 million target. But we really do want you guys as we do to focus more and more on ARR. ","David Wadhwani","Great. And on the question about the contributor payouts. The way we look at this opportunity is that, it is obviously a large growing opportunity where we have strong relationships with both the buying side and the selling side. And as we looked at the market make up, we saw the opportunity to grow this -- grow the TAM of this opportunity by doing two fundamental things. First was to move the friction in terms of how sellers and buyers come together. And that's what we've done to integrate both the selling and the buying directly within the tools. And we believe that's going to be a really big opportunity to increase the velocity of content flowing through the system. But the second thing we wanted to do is streamline the economics around these businesses. There we believe that the marketplace today is priced with too much complexity. So we wanted to streamline the opportunity for pricing for the buyers and we wanted to create a very simple price model for the contributors as well. So instead of doing a complex tiered approach Adobe Stock we are doing a simple 33% for sales that we have. ","Shantanu Narayen ","In terms of thinking of Q3 and Q4, Ross, just too maybe add a little bit more color. I would look at ARR being slightly up in Q3 and then sequentially up in Q4. And that's reasonable proxy for sub, sub.","David Wadhwani","Right, exactly. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much. Shantanu, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the digital marketing business just with two thirds of your customers now taking on more than one product. Could you just talk about some of the -- I guess the solution that are doing particularly well within sort of more of bundle framework and you start to sell more solution, I guess the competitive environment change at all or you just placing more point core products, is it so much mean the greenfield opportunity, I was wondering if you just provide a little bit more color on that front. Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen ","Sure, Kirk. With respect to where the bulk of the booking are right now and the revenue, I would say it is the combination of the Adobe experience manager which is helping people create the online web infrastructure for the future. It continues to be Adobe Analytics so people can get insight on what's exactly happening on their website. And Adobe Campaign continues to do very well which enables you to have multi-channel orchestration of communication with your customers. Having said that, the breadth of the offerings right now is starting to make all of the sticky and that's resulting in the increased booking and the most strategic relationships. And I can say that some of the smaller or newer solutions, when you look at what's happening with media optimizer as well as the other solutions like target. You are actually seeing that business double year-over-year. So we are seeing some really good traction in the new solutions as people look at the benefit of that. Primetime had a great quarter. Again, slightly smaller numbers in the scheme of things but the good news from our point of view is the new solutions like Audience Manager, Primetime, Target as well as media optimizer are doing really very well on a year-over-year basis. And makes the entire platform far more comprehensive and sticky.","Kirk Materne","If I get just have really quick follow up, you guys had some nice partnership announcement added to summit this year with Accenture, IBM. Can you just talk a little bit -- just about how your broader chain on this digital marketing is going in terms of the kind of leverage, you are potentially getting at if this type of partnership, if you want to talk about any of them specifically.","Shantanu Narayen ","Well, I think the great news is every single analyst who covers the digital marketing space has clearly identified Adobe as the leader. That continues to be the case, and what that means is that the inbound request for systems integrators, for digital agencies to want to partner with Adobe is only increasing. The way we look at the revenue as we look at what are partner source, partner influence and partner driven. And that as a percentage of the booking is certainly going up. And without highlighting anyone partner on this call, the number of significant partnership is only increasing. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you, I appreciate. Two questions. First on the Digital Marketing side. Bookings were bit slowly this quarter. Was this timing of billing, FX, deal closure, what else was impacting that number? Then on the Adobe Stock. Should we think this has been purchased by Digital Marketing Cloud customers or will the sale be through the Creative Cloud, their additional market? ","Shantanu Narayen ","So, Mark, I do want to clarify. We had a very strong bookings quarter in Q2. So as it related to bookings, our revenue Mark and maybe add more color on that but in terms of booking we had a very strong quarter with Digital Marketing. And as it relates to Adobe Stock very quickly, you can both as an individual get it through adobe.com as well as we have enterprise offering that we will sell. I think you are very perceptive in that the number of marketing professionals who will also use Stock and the integration of Adobe Stock with our Marketing Cloud also definitely represents on tapped opportunity. And as David said, we are really increasing the total available market for this because making pictures more accessible to people and allowing more people to contribute, I think that's a unique advantage that Adobe has. ","Mark Garrett","Yes, and Shantanu said Mark on the Digital Marketing side bookings were very strong. We are reiterating the 30% growth for the year despite the impact of currency. Revenue grew 15%, so if you looking at revenue, revenue growth were maybe a little less you would have thought. But as I said we expected that to ramp over the course of the year and in the second half of the year again despite currency, we are anticipating 24% growth in the second half of the year. Second half over second half. So there is some currency impact in there without a doubt but still strong growth in the back half of the year. ","Mark Moerdler","Perfect. And one quick and the follow up I apologize. How should we think about the impact of Document Cloud or document services revenue? We see a dip as quite tradition or is it just going to be revenue growth? ","Shantanu Narayen ","We talked about Document Cloud is that the revenue will continue to be relatively consistent or flat. But way we are seeing the adoption is in the annualized recurring revenue or ARR so we are seeing good growth in the ARR. I think we highlighted that in the prepared remarks as well. And we did see a good healthy subscription adoption of the new Acrobat DC product. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line Phil Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just have a question on the Marketing Cloud. Obviously a lot of companies have made acquisitions here in different categories so just the broad marketing space of that couple of years. Wondering if you could just comment on the competitive environment. What you are seeing out there? I just kind of look at your portfolio sort of versus the competition, what really sort of standout is why you continue to win business but also what areas do you think you could see yourself looking to fill in either organically or inorganically?","Shantanu Narayen ","Yes. I think to your point, everybody recognizes that addressing the chief revenue officer, the chief digital officer or chief marketing officer is the most explosive software category that exist. I think our sweet spot has always been how do we target this marketer publisher with the customer experience solutions that we have. In the offerings that we have I will continue to say, it is the combination of content plus data that represents the unique advantage that Adobe has. And that's the combination of the Adobe Experience Manager as well as Adobe Analytics. But the product that's doing really very well right now is Audience Manager. And what Audience Manager allows people to do is have absolutely the same segmentation across their marketing spend if they are trying to attract customers across any personalized offers that they want to make as well as conversion. And so I think it is the combination of all of our products. And honestly it is also the tieback with the creative products that content velocity in terms of people trying to run campaigns. The fact that Creative Cloud works with the Adobe Experience Manager asset management solution that enables us whether you are a retailer, whether you are a financial servicers, whether you are government, whether you are a publisher, that content velocity that we can provide is just so much faster than anybody else. And I think across the marketing platform, we don't really don't see one single competitor. We do have a number of point product competitors for each of the individual solutions but I think as the comprehensiveness of our offering that enables us to win those deals. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks, good afternoon. Now the question first on the components of growth in the doc services or Document Cloud. ARR then a cash flow question. So this was touched on couple of questions back but when we think about the components of doc services in terms of new business you must be shipping at least couple million new licenses a year of acrobat. And you made very clear that you are not going to pull the plug on perpetual at least not any time soon but how are you thinking about regarding those or having signed as subscription versus perpetual and then on the ETLA side of doc services, win an extends that ETLA there is a proportion of doc services, it should be substantially higher for historically based reasons than ETLA on the creative side. Another words looks like ETLA are about tenth of creative ARR. But given the old volume license in part of Acrobat shouldn't ETLA be much, much higher percentage of doc services.","Shantanu Narayen ","So, Jay, with respect to the Document Cloud you are right that the ETLA portion of document services is higher than the ETLA portion of the Creative Cloud due to the historical adoption of Acrobat within the enterprise. And then moving to three year ETLAs. With respect to individual, Acrobat shrink used to continue to be a part of the offering and now on adobe.com the main offering that we provide is the subscription offering and the subscription offering uptake within individuals and teams is actually very healthy. I think what's happen honestly in the marketplace is that when you look at after Creative Cloud even Office 365 has now been offered through subscription is just become the most standardized way of happening. And so you are right that the perpetual mix of Acrobat is higher than other products in our category. But what we continue to be pleased with is that when people come to adobe.com, the individual adoption which is important to create that viral impact within enterprises, the subscription offering uptake is very healthy. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","All right, thanks. On cash flow for Mark, through the first half your GAAP operating cash flow is about 650, you gave your guidance for the second half of the year, into taking into account currency plus the stocking effect to the model doesn't extend to reason that your second half cash flow should be at least much and probably substantially higher than the first half, so that total fiscal 2015 cash flow should be at least couple hundred million higher than the amount of fiscal 2014.","Mark Garrett","Yes, Jay, so we don't guide obviously on cash flow. I can't tell you there is quarterly seasonality to cash flow. If you look at Q4 to Q1 it is typically down coming off of Q4 due to all the yearend payments that you make and debt interest and then you get to Q2 and there is none of those payments so it goes back up which is what you saw this quarter. In Q3, you typically see a dip relative to last quarter again because of tax payments and ESPP and debt interest and then you got a spike back up in Q4. So there is seasonality quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, the net income and the business starts to get better and better as we start to drive more and more earnings, cash flow is going to follow that. So without a doubt cash flow is going to get better and better. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss","Thank you, guys for taking the question and good quarter. You talked about earlier on there is quite much decline in ARPU dollar was small you have seen in quite some time. And it seems like we have a couple of financial -- and several potential ARPU sort of benefit on the horizon. I was wondering if you could talk just little bit about what our expectations should be with the timing of that particularly on when we think that the Adobe Stock is fair than getting ARPU and when this sort of the renewal of commercial pricing or the expiration promotional pricing could start to get benefit ARPUs so just we get better understanding to following that ARPU.","Mark Garrett","Keith, I'll start and then Shantanu or David can add on. I have to sound like a broken record but focus on ARR right I mean that's really the metric that's going to incorporate everything. Subs, ARR, any kind of churn so that is where we are focused and we obviously feel good about that because just we just raised the number on the year for ARR. ","Shantanu Narayen ","And I think in terms of the mix when you think about what's happening with the mix just continue to recognize as we've said that within each band ARPU has been very stable and as the mix continues to drive new offerings what the ARPU will reflect is the blended mix and so I'll also end with what Mark said. I think continuing to focus on ARR and if you look at the second half of the year it shows that ARR will continue to increase over Q1 and Q2 which I think shows the momentum in the business. ","Keith Weiss","Got it, and I take rather different type of question then, I think you mentioned earlier about that the conversion of trial customers to the end users are improving. Wondering if you could just give little bit color in terms of -- is that an inflection going on or is just an improvement, is there anything that this kind of cap rising that a transition from residue.","David Wadhwani","Yes. I can take that. From a perspective of the improvements we've been seeing to conversion and retention associated with mobile application I believe is what you are referring to the statement you made. This is really just an ongoing evolution that we started a year and half ago. As we started to move more and more of our business online, we have the added advantage of having access to the world's best Marketing Cloud. So in the context of using all of the technology from that side of the business, it has been an ongoing set of activities to improve conversion that we see as traffic comes to adobe.com. More recently we've had an increase in terms of traffic and utilization of our mobile applications. So we understand what's driving that, what are the predictive indicators of use in those applications that are driving conversion to paid customers. And we are increasingly seeing the use of data and content flows with creative sync as another material driver of conversions and retention. So what we are doing is that we are building the products and updating the products with new capabilities and features, but we are also making sure that as we do that the user experience, the on boarding workflows and the communication that we have with them through email and other forms through training are all driving people to use these features that drive higher conversion and retention. So it is not one magic bullet but it has been a series of actions that we've taken. And we see a lot more we can do in the years to come. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Steve Ashley","Thanks. A couple of questions. I think on the last call you said that Japan had been really lagging in terms of just where it was in Creative Cloud adoption but we had started to see some improvement there. Is that improvement or ramping of Creative Cloud adoption in Japan continuing? Then my second question is just on the Marketing Cloud business and partner or channel leverage. Are you seeing improved partner contribution in that business? Thanks. ","Shantanu Narayen ","Yes. So, Steve, Japan continues to as the distance from CS6 gets longer and longer improve, we have a special event also that we are doing in Japan to ensure that the awareness of the CC2015 as well as all of the other additional services and mobile apps is strong right now. And so we continue to expect that would lead to increased adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan. And the second question was with respect to Marketing Cloud and partner leverage. I mentioned earlier that the amount of partner influence across sourced as well as influenced, revenue and the Marketing Cloud is fairly high and that's happening across both digital agencies as well as system integrators. And all of the large deals that we are doing because consulting is something that we would like partners to provide, there is a partner involved in most of the larger deals. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Stephens. Your line is now open.","Alex Zukin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about what you are seeing with respect to overall users that are realizing some of the synergies throughout content creation and distribution and maybe which combination are currently the most popular?","Shantanu Narayen ","Sure. I think we've talked in the past about how the publishing segment for sure as publishers are trying to provide the content creation once and then delivery across multiple forms of devices. That's clearly the vertical that has led the integration of Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud. Retail tends to be another large vertical where we are seeing a lot of adoption of the Creative Cloud and the Marketing Cloud because the velocity of the products that they are offering tends to be fairly high. And everything to do with consumers, whether it is travel or entertainment is an area where I think we've talked about companies like Under Armour and others who are certainly using that particular technology as well. So we are seeing it across all industries, financial services, honestly we are getting better at also painting the entire Adobe story with the CC Enterprise release that's coming out now. And the fact that it synchronizes with the Adobe Marketing Cloud, that's going to make it even more natural. So while I would say the publishing and retail led the charge in terms of seeing the benefits of the creative cloud and marketing cloud integration, now that's spreading to honestly every single vertical in every geography.","Alex Zukin","Got it. In fact if I could just squeeze in one more about the recent partnership announcement with Microsoft and what that could means strategically for Marketing Cloud?","Shantanu Narayen ","Yes. I think with Marketing Cloud, our vision really is that as every single enterprise moves to become more of a real time enterprise where the need to in the last millisecond deliver the right piece of content based on the consumer profile or the consumer demographic, it becomes even more apparent to us that enabling us integration with people who have CRM solution is something that will add value of our Marketing Cloud. So Microsoft with dynamic CRM has a great offering in that and that was the reason for the integration. The other reason for our partnership with Microsoft continues to be how we can leverage Azure in terms of having technology that enables us to create all of these compelling offerings in real time. So that's the benefit on the digital marketing side. On the Creative Cloud side I think we've shown that as touch becomes more natural way for people to do content creation with what we've done on the Surface Pro and in products like Illustrator and Photoshop, I think we've demonstrated significant value associated with touch which both Microsoft and Adobe are excited about.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Samad Samana","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I want to shift gears a little bit and talk about the profitability side, margin expanded, nice swing continue to say year-over-year, operating expenses were actually down year-over-year, I was curious how you think about the ramp in expenses, whether there is some cash that will happen in the back, how we should expect expenses to ramp going forward?","Mark Garrett","Hi, it is Mark. Yes, we've obviously been very focused on driving earnings back into the model as revenue comes back into the model. And as we get back to where we before we started this transition which is going to happen relatively soon. Moving forward from here you will see OpEx increase and I touched on this earlier, we are driving 30% bookings growth in digital marketing that requires a lot of sales and marketing capacity. And obviously we are driving ETLAs in the enterprise for the document services business the Document Cloud business as well as the creative business. So you will see more OpEx investment but with that we are going to continue to drive more and more margin moving forward. ","Operator","And finally our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. ","Shateel Alam","Hi, this is Shateel Alam filling in for Heather. I just want to ask a quick one on seasonality of single app subs. in the past you said that mix was about 50:50; little lower this quarter at 44%. Should we expect that to swing around a lot from quarter-to-quarter and what do you expect that to fall out at for the year? ","Shantanu Narayen ","I think what we've said in the past is if you look steady state or what's happen in the Creatives suite, the mix was approximately 50:50, I think as we continue to attract new customers to the platform through the Creative Cloud photography offering, we are certainly seeing the single app adoption increase. We've also said in the past that when we first offered team, team was only offered in the complete option and the single app is definitely an on ramp to the Creative Cloud. And so I think as it relates to the creative segment part of Creative Cloud, steady state on the Creatives suite is probably a good metric. Certainly as we are expanding the entire available market through the introduction of these new single app offerings that was skew it a little bit more towards the single app as well. ","Given that was the last question, sort of in summary what I would like to say is it is clear that all around the world companies are focusing on how they use technology as an enablers to accomplish this customer centric transformation. And I think delivering these great online experiences across mobile devices which is key to the transformation is driving Adobe's business because we have this unique set of technology assets to help customers solve this across various industries. And the business momentum we are experiencing, we believe is a result of both having a great strategy as well as excellent execution. We are pleased with Creative Cloud momentum. This week was a really important milestone as we release CC2015 and introduced Adobe Stock which is both an ARPU as well as TAM enhancing service. And it is really more proof of how we are making Creative Cloud a one stop destination for creators. Document Cloud continues to go after the large paper to digital opportunity and Marketing Cloud continues to be the leader and delivering great value in an explosive software category. I think in this quarter you also saw the earnings upside which is the leverage of our financial model. And in summary we think Adobe is in great shape and we remain focused on driving both product innovation as well as strong financial results for the rest of 2015 and beyond. Thank you for joining us today. ","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call."],"630":["Adobe, Inc.

I'd like to welcome you to Adobe Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would like to now turn the call over to Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; and John Murphy, Executive Vice President and CFO.","In our call today, we will discuss Adobe's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 financial results.

An archive of the webcast will be made available on Adobe's Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days and is the property of Adobe. The call audio and the webcast archive may not be re-recorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Fiscal 2018 was an outstanding year for Adobe, and I'm thrilled with what we've accomplished. Our vision to empower people to create and transform how businesses compete has never been more relevant, and we welcomed millions of new customers to Adobe. From students to creative professionals to government agencies in the world's most successful brands, customers everywhere are turning to Adobe to tell their story, drive their digital businesses and change the world.","This year, we delivered significant innovation across Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud. We made strategic acquisitions, which have expanded our offerings in addressable markets, and we forged key partnerships that bring us increased scale. These actions have resulted in record revenue and impressive growth across all our businesses. As we enter 2019, Adobe is well positioned to build on this momentum, delight our customers and continue to deliver impressive long-term top and bottom line growth.","Total Adobe revenue was $9.03 billion in FY '18, which represents 24% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY '18 was $5.20, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.76. Total Digital Media annualized recurring revenue or ARR exiting the year grew to $6.83 billion. FY '18 Creative revenue was $5.34 billion, which represents 28% year-over-year growth. We achieved annual revenue of $982 million for Document Cloud. And in our Digital Experience business, Experience Cloud revenue for the full year was $2.44 billion, representing 20% year-over-year growth.","We closed the year with another record quarter, delivering Q4 revenue of $2.46 billion, representing 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.37, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.83. These results include the acquisition of Marketo and the associated financial impacts that come with a large transaction. Excluding Marketo, we met or exceeded all of our Q4 and annual targets.","Adobe believes everyone has a story to tell. Tens of millions of people around the world tell their story with Creative Cloud, whether it's in a high school magazine, a mobile app, a documentary at Sundance or an enterprise website. We achieved record Creative revenue of $1.45 billion in Q4 with 26% year-over-year growth.","In Q4, our Creative business was fueled by strong performance across all segments, particularly among consumers. Black Friday and Cyber Monday were two of the largest single selling days in company history. We focused on expanding the value of Creative Cloud for existing customers while extending its capabilities to meet the needs of broad new segments of users. In October, we held our annual MAX Creativity Conference. MAX has become a movement with reach and impact well beyond the physical event. This year, hundreds of thousands of Creative customers tuned in online to watch MAX and millions more continue to view MAX content.","Product announcements at MAX included major updates to our flagship Creative tools, including Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign and Premiere Pro; the introduction of Premiere Rush, the first all-in-one, easy-to-use video editing app for social media creators, simplifying video creation and sharing on leading platforms such as YouTube and Instagram. Online video is one of the fastest growing Creative segments, and Rush is a cornerstone of our strategy to unlock this opportunity for millions of new customers.","Exciting new innovations, powered by Adobe Sensei inside of Adobe XD, include new technology for prototyping experiences and applications for voice-enabled devices such as Amazon Echo; and new apps including Photoshop on the iPad, which will bring the power and precision of Photoshop to a touch device; and Project Gemini, a new drawing and painting application that brings unprecedented watercolor and oil painting capabilities to the digital canvas. In our Document Cloud business, we're revolutionizing how people scan, edit, collaborate, sign and share Adobe PDFs, whether they're consumers, small businesses or large enterprises. Document Cloud revenue in Q4 was $259 million, and we grew Document Cloud ARR to more than $800 million.","We continue to accelerate our pace of innovation with Document Cloud, investing to modernize the PDF experience on every device and surface and building on the document intelligence available from the billions of PDFs in market to power AI-driven experiences. We recently shipped an all-new Acrobat DC with connected mobile apps like Adobe Scan and Acrobat Reader Mobile to create, share and collaborate with PDFs across smartphones and tablets. Adobe Sign, our e-signature solution, continues to gain momentum across businesses through new integrations and partnerships, including Dropbox, Microsoft Dynamics and ServiceNow. Digital transformation continues to be the mandate for CEOs across the globe. To compete and win today, both B2C and B2B businesses must provide a world-class, end-to-end customer experience across every touch point. With Experience Cloud, Adobe is reimagining customer experience management and delivering the industry's only end-to-end solution for marketing, advertising, analytics and commerce purpose built for the modern enterprise. In our Digital Experience business, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $690 million for the quarter, which represents 25% year-over-year growth.","Key Experience Cloud customer wins in the quarter include Unilever, The Home Depot, Telegraph Media Group, Geico, Heathrow Airport and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Delivering exceptional customer experiences demands deep customer insights and a platform built for action. We continue to invest in building the industry's first open platform for customer experience management, the Adobe Experience Platform. The Adobe Experience Platform will deliver true, unified view of the customer for both CMOs and CIOs. In partnership with Microsoft and SAP, the recently announced Open Data Initiative is aimed at eliminating the data silos that exist across enterprises. It will enable enterprises to harness and take action on massive volumes of customer data to deliver personalized, real-time customer experiences. We're excited to have early support for ODI from leading brands, including Coca-Cola and Walmart.","Adobe's retail reports, powered by Adobe Analytics data, have become the industry bellwether for holiday shopping forecasts and other digital media, commerce and cultural trends. Adobe analyzed over 1 trillion visits and 55 million product SKUs across U.S. retail sites this holiday season. Data showed that online sales reached $7.9 billion on Cyber Monday, making it the largest online shopping day of all time in the U.S. In October, we completed our acquisition of Marketo, the leader in B2B marketing engagement, and we're off to a great start. Marketo strengthens our offering to customers, combining Experience Cloud's analytics, personalization, commerce and content capabilities with Marketo's B2B marketing engagement platform, helping customers automate and orchestrate mission-critical marketing campaigns and activities from lead management and customer engagement to account-based marketing and revenue attribution.","The addition of Marketo, along with our recently integrated commerce capabilities via our acquisition of Magento, widens Adobe's lead in customer management across both B2B and B2C in all industries. We're well positioned to continue capitalizing on this growing opportunity that we estimate to have a total addressable market of more than $71 billion by 2021. Adding Marketo to our Digital Experience business immediately accelerates overall revenue growth for Adobe, and other financial benefits will ramp during FY '19 as the accounting impact from the transaction dissipates.","Adobe is the clear leader in the markets we serve: creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. Our solutions have become indispensable to millions of customers, whether they are in the design department or the IT department, the classroom or the boardroom. At Adobe, it is our 20,000 global employees that form the heart and soul of our business. In October, we achieved global gender pay parity, a critical milestone in Adobe's commitment to providing employees with a workplace that is diverse and inclusive. Last week, we were named one of Fortune's Top 100 Best Workplaces for Diversity. Adobe was once again ranked on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, a key barometer tracking sustainability-driven companies.","In 2018, we made significant investments across our product portfolio, entered new markets and made strategic acquisitions, which we believe will fuel continued top and bottom line performance. We expect 2019 to be another year of strong product innovation and financial results. John?","John Murphy","Thanks, Shantanu. We're pleased with our Q4 and full year FY '18 results. We're excited about our acquisition of Marketo, which closed on October 31, and as part of my prepared remarks, I will review our consolidated Q4 and FY '18 results and outline Marketo's impact in comparison to our targets previously provided, which excluded Marketo. In FY '18, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $9.03 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $5.20, and non-GAAP EPS was $6.76.","Noteworthy achievements during the year include: Creative revenue of $5.34 billion, which represents 28% year-over-year growth; Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $982 million, which represents 17% year-over-year growth; adding a record $1.45 billion of net new Digital Media ARR during the year, and exiting FY '18 with $6.83 billion of Digital Media ARR; Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.44 billion, which represents 20% year-over-year growth; generating more than $4 billion in operating cash flow during the year; returning $2 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program; and growing deferred revenue to approximately $3 billion, and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $5 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $8 billion of contracted revenue.","Total annual revenue growth, excluding Magento and Marketo, was approximately 22%, well ahead of the revenue target we provided entering the year. In the fourth quarter of FY '18, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.46 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.37, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.83. Excluding the impact of the Marketo acquisition in Q4, we estimate GAAP EPS would have been $1.48 and non-GAAP diluted EPS would have been $1.90, both of which would have exceeded the earnings targets we provided in September.","Business and financial highlights in Q4 included: Digital Media revenue of $1.71 billion, including Creative revenue of $1.45 billion and Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $259 million; record net new Digital Media ARR of $430 million; Digital Experience revenue of $690 million, which represents 25% year-over-year growth; deferred revenue growth of 22% year-over-year; record cash flow from operations of $1.1 billion; returning $397 million of cash to our stockholders through stock buyback; and approximately 90% of our revenue in Q4 was from recurring sources.","In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of $430 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $6.83 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 26% year-over-year in Q4, and we increased Creative ARR by a record $373 million.","Key growth drivers included: strong net new subscriptions across user segments and geographies, driven by robust traffic and customer acquisition on adobe.com and helped by typical year-end benefits including enterprise seasonality, post-MAX traffic and holiday campaigns, which drove strong consumer adoption; education market success driven by our year-long effort to increase our focus on Creative Cloud use by students and schools; continued momentum with Creative Cloud in emerging markets; services adoption, including continued strength with Adobe Stock revenue, which grew by more than 25% during the year; and pricing optimizations in North America. As we outlined at our financial analyst meeting in October, we're focused on numerous initiatives to continue to fuel Creative Cloud growth in the coming years.","We achieved record Document Cloud revenue of $259 million in Q4, which represents 10% year-over-year growth, and we added $57 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. As we discussed previously, in Q4 FY '17, we achieved a significant amount of perpetual Acrobat revenue through the channel, which impacts year-over-year comparisons.","Acrobat unit growth across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud was greater than 30% during the year, and Adobe Sign revenue grew by more than 25% during FY '18. With strong Acrobat subscription and Document Cloud services adoption, we exited FY '18 with more than $800 million of Document Cloud ARR and solid momentum.","In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved record quarterly Experience Cloud revenue of $690 million. Magento exceeded the $30 million target we shared previously for Q4, and Marketo added $21 million during the quarter. Digital Experience year-over-year segment growth was 25% in Q4 inclusive of Marketo and 22% excluding Marketo, ahead of our Q4 target of approximately 20%. For the year, Digital Experience year-over-year segment growth was 20% inclusive of Magento and Marketo.","We finished the year with strong subscription bookings in line with our target. In Q4, Experience Cloud subscription revenue grew 30% year-over-year; and for the year, we achieved 26% year-over-year Experience Cloud subscription revenue growth, both including Magento and Marketo. Experience Cloud performance in Q4 was driven by success across our offerings with particular strength in Analytics, AEM Assets and Magento Commerce. Our go-to-market relationship with Microsoft resulted in strong bookings in Q4 and during the year.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.5 million. We had $30.5 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '18 versus $16.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY '18. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.2 million.","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $7.9 million. We had $30.5 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '18 versus $1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY '17. Thus, the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $37.4 million.","In Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 3% on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. Both rates were lower than targeted due to a more favorable-than-expected geographic mix of earnings as well as the favorable resolutions of certain income tax matters.","Our trade DSO was 49 days, which compares to 55 days in the year-ago quarter and 41 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $3.05 billion, up 22% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was $3.23 billion, and cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion in the quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decline in our cash position was due to the funding of the Marketo acquisition.","In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $397 million. During FY '18, we repurchased 8.7 million shares at a cost of $2 billion. We currently have $7.85 billion remaining of our new $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May, which goes through 2021.","Now I will discuss our financial targets for the coming year. Entering FY '19, we are excited about our business momentum, our market leadership position and the large addressable markets we presented at our recent financial analyst meeting in October. The strategic acquisitions we made in FY '18 increased FY '19 revenue growth targets with some added complexity in describing our financial outlook. I'll explain some of the details as I walk you through our targets. As we've stated previously, we will report our FY '19 results based on the new ASC 606 accounting standards beginning in March with our Q1 results. The targets we are providing today are based on ASC 605 as we are still in the process of integrating Marketo into our financial systems to report results utilizing 606. We continue to believe that moving to 606 in FY '19 reporting will not materially impact our revenue. However, we now expect there will be a slight improvement to earnings through the year as we benefit from the capitalization of sales commissions.","We measure ARR in constant currency during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year-end for current currency rates. Adverse FX rate changes between December of last year and this year have resulted in a $123 million adjustment and lowers our beginning FY '19 Digital Media ARR balance to $6.71 billion. This expected revision is reflected in our updated investor datasheet and our FY '19 net new growth target, and our quarterly results will be measured against this revalued amount during FY '19. In FY '19, we are targeting total Adobe revenue of approximately $11,150,000,000; Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $1.45 billion, an increase above our preliminary target provided in October; Digital Experience segment revenue growth of approximately 34%; Digital Experience subscription bookings growth of approximately 25%; a GAAP tax rate of approximately 10% and a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 11%; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $5.54; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $7.75.","Certain factors are reflected in our FY '19 annual targets specifically: approximately $35 million of adverse revenue impact due to current FX rates, which have moved against us since we provided preliminary FY '19 targets that were based on September spot rates; approximately $75 million reduction in revenue from the write-down of deferred revenue for Magento and Marketo due to purchase accounting; and the increase in tax rates between FY '18 and FY '19. In Q1 FY '19, we are targeting revenue of approximately $2,540,000,000; Digital Media segment year-over-year growth of approximately 20%; net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $330 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 31%; other expense of approximately $39 million; tax rate of approximately 3% on a GAAP basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 495 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.14; and non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.60.","For modeling purposes, after Q1, we expect total revenue in each quarter to grow by approximately the same year-over-year growth percentage implied in our targeted revenue growth rate for the year. In addition, after Q1, we expect net new Digital Media ARR in each quarter to be sequentially similar as that achieved in past fiscal years from quarter-to-quarter with typical summer seasonality, which can lead to sequentially lower net new ARR in Q3 as well as normal year-end sequential strength in Q4 net new ARR. As the impact of lost deferred revenue due to purchase accounting tapers off during FY '19 and as we grow our business, we expect quarterly operating margins to increase sequentially. We also expect quarterly year-over-year earnings growth rates to increase during the year.","In summary, FY '18 was another record year for Adobe as demonstrated by our strong revenue and earnings growth and exceptional cash flow from operations. More importantly, during the year, we've invested in the business to continue our momentum over the long term. Our growth targets for the coming year reflect our confidence in our ability to execute, and we expect to exit FY '19 with a business that continues to exhibit strong top line growth, expanding profit margins and earnings growth rates that equal or exceed top line growth rates.","I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, John.

[Operator Instructions]. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter Pritchard","I'm wondering, for Shantanu, on the Creative side, as we look to next year, fiscal '19, and ARR that you're talking about, can you help us understand maybe how some of the drivers that you saw this year may evolve into 2019? Which of the drivers there were -- do you expect to continue? Which do you expect to strengthen? And any that you expect to sort of wane in terms of driving that $1.45 billion ARR?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Walter. I mean, first, as it relates to FY '18, we're certainly thrilled with the performance; and when you think about both Q4 and FY '18, we actually saw strength in ARR across all offerings as well as all geographies. Q4 was characterized, I would say, with the typical seasonal enterprise strength that we see at the end of Q4. We saw a bunch of consumer strength as we also said in our prepared remarks. But whether it was the Individual offering, the team offering or the enterprise offering, they just continue to show quite a bit of momentum. And we expect that momentum, frankly, to continue into FY '19. So I think from the Individual products, when you think about what's happening with the photography bundle, what's happening with Acrobat, what's happening with the video products, clearly, we've identified that we're working on some new categories like XD and what we showed with augmented reality and virtual reality, continued offering of services, which is adding to this. But as you remember, even during MAX, we announced numerous set of initiatives that we expect we'll all continue to drive, emerging markets, continued adoption of our services. So we're just really pleased. And I think it's important to remember, even when you look at the $1.45 billion target for next year, that FX did go adversely against us. And so when we think about both new units as well as renewal of units that happens next year, if they are internationally, that's actually going to be adverse relative to FY '18, so clearly, I think, indicating that the momentum that we saw in '18 will continue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.","Saket Kalia","Shantanu, just to maybe think a little higher level, can you just talk about how the Digital Experience sales force might change this year now that it has just a lot more to sell and potentially different types of customers to sell into with both B2C and B2B? How do you think about the sales force can sort of go to market in 2019 with the addition of Magento and Marketo?","Shantanu Narayen","Saket, what we have done is, even in fiscal '18 as we have segmented the market and we think very strategically about what's happening in what we call the strategic accounts versus the corporate accounts versus the territory accounts, we've got a go to market that's optimized around what's the best way to generate pipeline, what's the best way to have what we would call named account salespeople versus the specialists. And the more comprehensive the offering, the more it actually strengthens our ability to drive pipeline and then convert existing customers. FY '18 was characterized, I think, by a return to momentum that we saw in subscription bookings. We have certainly seen good adoption, as we mentioned, of our Analytics and AEM products as well as Magento. And so what I'm excited about in FY '19 is when you think about what we had with Adobe Campaign and the B2C high-volume e-mail and cross-channel campaign capability, when you think about what Marketo bought in B2B with a lead management and account-based marketing capability, we now have really a far more comprehensive offering for the enterprise to manage and personalize their end-to-end customer journeys across all channels. So we've already demonstrated integration. Magento is being integrated with AEM. So it just feels like there's more demand for our products. There's more refinement of our go to market; and there's a strengthening, frankly, of the offering, which should help.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Brad Zelnick","Congrats on a strong finish to a great year. Shantanu, at MAX, you spoke a bit about Adobe's data-driven operating model, but I think it would be helpful if you could spend a moment reminding us why this is a competitive advantage and how it contributes to the visibility and predictability that you have in your business.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Brad, and thanks for the comments. I mean, going back to the data-driven operating model, I mean it's a vocabulary that's so prevalent now within Adobe; and when we talk about discover, try, buy, use and renew, I think it just enables us to have tremendous focus across each part of it. I think most companies start off with really good awareness at the top of the funnel, which is on the discovery phase, but what I think we have done is actually provided a really good mathematical underpinning to what we need to do across each of those. So I know you have and others in the past have asked us questions about how we think about promotions. We have incredible data about what is the right way to target those customers, how do they then convert into paying customers, in which countries do trials work, in which countries do trials not work. In terms of the buying, what are the right offers? How do you make recommendations? How do you convert people and upsell them into other offerings? And on the use, which is where I would say in FY '18 we spent the most time, clearly, as the base grows larger and larger and larger, it's in the utilization of the products and ensuring that they get value that the greatest upside exists for Adobe. And so the best example I could give you is once I was at a Wednesday meeting where the entire team was talking about what was happening in realtime and they were making decisions in realtime. So having this mathematical underpinning in a model and empowering people in realtime across every geography to make the right decisions based on data, I think that's really the power of this model. And I think you've seen that in our results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray.","Taylor Reiners","This is Taylor Reiners on for Alex. I guess one of the interesting points we picked up from our conversations with partners is that it seems like AEM Forms has been picking up quite a bit. I was wondering if you could dig in a bit more on the momentum you've been seeing there. And then maybe any comments on what you've been seeing within the e-signature market?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. I mean, I think the whole paper-to-digital movement just continues to be a big driver of what's happening in digital transformation. And so if you think about most enterprises, what they have to do is they first have to create this website to engage with customers, and then allowing them to transact businesses digitally is a big imperative. And so to that end, what we have done, both on the Acrobat side as well as on the AEM Forms side to allow everything from ad hoc workflows as well as more structured workflows to happen using our products, it's clearly a drive that we see. Government tends to be a big area of usage for AEM Forms as you can imagine, and the usage of PDF there is high because governments can never mandate that citizens buy software in order to engage with customers.","And so I think that's the reason for the underlying strength. And AEM is a platform. It's -- we also talked about AEM Assets and how content management has grown. And from our point of view, as we think about documents, sign is just one of the many verbs that we focus on. The entire document opportunity is such a large opportunity. And it's -- signing is something that we've enabled. We have this incredible reach in terms of the client that we have, and the footprint allows us to sign things. But it's, again, all about creating those documents and sharing those documents and scanning those documents. And so our strength in PDF as a format, our strength in the web content management and our strength in these verbs, including the ability for people to sign, I think, is what gives us confidence that this will continue to drive business for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI.","Stewart Materne","I\u2019ll echo the comments around another strong quarter and great year. I guess, Shantanu, I was wondering just about Magento. It seems that, that came in a little bit above your expectations, and I know it's still early. But commerce seems to be an area that almost every enterprise is interested in to some degree or the other. I was just kind of curious about how that's helping round out -- I think you talked about this a little bit earlier -- but how that's specifically helping you round out sort of your offering, especially at B2C clients as that's an area you used to have to partner with other people around. So I was just kind of curious if you could just comment specifically on Magento.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Kirk. I mean, strategically there are two things that we're excited about with the Magento Commerce solution. The first is, for larger enterprises, the ability to now finally close the loop. We have the content management. We have audience segmentation. And at MagentoLive in Barcelona, we actually already have shown how you can integrate AEM with Magento Commerce. So that's been one of the strategic wins for us as people are thinking about next-generation commerce with mobile being a more fundamental part of it. So just having that built-in integration, having the ability for our salespeople to sell the entire solution to our customers, it's clearly an advantage. The other strategic area of focus for us with Magento is really -- well, Magento was very strong, namely in the mid-market and small and medium businesses. The fact that we have technology and content management and analytics and personalization to add to that as an out-of-box offering for those set of customers is also a strategic advantage for us. And certainly, Marketo adds to that in terms of the offering for that particular segment of customers. So it's across both these dimensions that we do it. And underlying all of that, I think, is their over 300,000 developer, the ecosystem that they have, that's, in effect for us, a channel and that I think with Adobe's brand and that distribution and reach, I think we should continue to capitalize on that opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe with UBS.","Jennifer Lowe","Thank you for the detail on Marketo and Magento impacts in Q4 and maybe rolling that to fiscal '19. I think there's a few breadcrumbs in there that would let us get to the revenue impact and the interest expense impacts associated with Marketo. But can you just talk a little bit about the expense line impacts from Marketo embedded in the guidance, both in terms of direct cost acquires with Marketo and also opportunities to invest in that business given that private equity's been controlling the purse strings for a while?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, first, Jennifer, I think there were a little bit more than breadcrumbs, but we appreciate the call out in terms of us trying to be transparent associated with that business. Maybe I'll take a little step back and then John can add colors. But I think we just look at it and say Q4 and FY '18, the financial results were clearly stellar. At MAX, as you know, we provided sort of the preliminary targets for FY '19, ARR of $1.4 billion, Digital Media revenue growth of 20%. At that point, what we had said was that we expect DX revenue growth of 20% and subscription bookings growth of 25%. And as you know, at that point, it did not include Marketo because the deal hadn't closed, but we highlighted two things.","We highlighted that it would probably -- the earnings would be impacted moving forward as you factor in Marketo, and the tax rate would also impact our earnings profile. What we tried to do is update all of that today to both reflect the continued momentum and demonstrate that -- so from a currency perspective, currency went against us. So since September, despite that, we've raised our ARR target from $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion. We've kept the revenue growth for Digital Media at 20% despite, again, as I said, foreign exchange is going against us. In Digital Experience, which is your question, as we think about it, the segment revenue target we have raised to 34% year-over-year growth. So clearly, we are reflecting the continued momentum that we would expect as a result of getting Marketo. The base is much larger right now. And so including that base, what we said is that we expect to drive 25% subscription bookings growth for this much larger book of business, and that's already factored in how we think about the operating expense in terms of what goes for Marketo and actually what goes for the entire DX business.","And then what we tried to do is reflect that, while we continue to be excited about the potential of earnings, once you factor in the accounting impact of purchase accounting that's approximately $75 million for Magento and Marketo, primarily in the first half of the year, that's like a 15% -- $0.15 impact in non-GAAP earnings. So that's sort of how we think about it. We're certainly investing for growth. You see that as we talk about a 25% growth in the entire subscription bookings growth, and we try to reflect what the accounting impacts are as well in that business, which should taper off starting the middle of the year and towards Q3 and Q4. So hopefully, that helps set the context of how we move from MAX. And if you think about it from an operational basis, Marketo is actually not dilutive. So what you have to do is factor in what's happening with accounting for deferred revenue. You have to factor in, as you said, the financing and what happens in that particular area as well as you have to think about what's happening with respect to tax rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies.","Brent Thill","On Digital Media ARR, you raised the guidance by 3.5% or $50 million going into '19. I guess, can you just outline your confidence to make that big a raise right out of the gate here?","Shantanu Narayen","Brent, again, I think it just reflects the momentum that we saw in Q4. I think we outlined a number of different initiatives that we just continue to drive. I mean, we're certainly going to see the benefits of pricing and how we continue to optimize that around the world. It's the new product introductions that are coming and just continued strength in Acrobat in emerging markets. We continue to do a good job combating piracy. We're seeing good strength at what we call named user deployment within the enterprises, I think continued strength in Sign and Stock and what that's doing to the particular business. So just across all of the various priorities that we outlined, we just continue to feel good about the opportunity and we have to continue to execute, Brent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America.","Kasthuri Rangan","Shantanu, I am curious if -- when you come through your natural intelligence and artificial intelligence from Sensei, what is the current read? Because I think you're one of the very few companies that has reported a Q4 and is giving guidance for Q1. What is your take on the emerging markets, especially in some of the volatilities you have seen? Whereas the U.S. seems to be a pocket of strength. What is your take on these other questionable economies and your prognostication behind how you'd see those markets play out for Adobe next year?","Shantanu Narayen","I mean, from our perspective, I think we're no economists. What we see is that both creativity as important initiative for everybody just continues to be really an area of emphasis and digital transformation and the digital tailwinds or headwinds that enterprises are seeing, depending on their perspective. So I think what gives us confidence is that it doesn't matter which country you're in. Digital has become an imperative for enterprises. And for individuals, the importance of creativity and design has never been more important. And so we will just continue to monitor it, we see strength across emerging markets as well. We've talked about that. I think the fact that we have a differential pricing scheme that allows us to target customers in those emerging markets might help. But overall, clearly, the exposure in that area for us is probably lower than some of the other companies that you are covering.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Shantanu, I'd like to follow up on two broad statements Adobe made about its business, one at MAX and one at Summit. At MAX, the company said that Creative Cloud at least is at an inflection point in terms of moving from the desktop largely to more of a multiservice -- surface device TAM. And at Summit, you noted that your objective in Digital Experience is to enable or establish what you call that Experience System of Record. On the former, could you talk about how you're thinking about your correlation of Creative Cloud new business to new hardware business as compared to the old days of packaged software in terms of the correlation to hardware sales. And then for the latter, do you think that you've established now the Experience System of Record, you are de facto, you've done that? Or do you think that's still aspirational?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Jay, first, as it relates to our belief and assertions around multisurface, it stems from a very simple observation that we want to enable our products to be used wherever inspiration strikes. And second, I think to your question, the capabilities of these new devices, whether they be tablets or whether they be mobile devices are infinitely more powerful than the prior generation. And so whenever there's a step function in capability or there's a new modality like voice or touch or other interfaces that emerge, all of them represent opportunities for Adobe. We pioneered our own offering in that particular space with Lightroom, and we are seeing good results with Lightroom, which is clearly a space where people want to be able to manage their pictures on any device that they want.","The second category in which we have shown a lot of capability in this particular space is with XD, where, again, the number of people who design products and the number of people -- stakeholders in that entire design workflow is probably significantly larger than those who design. So those were the two first flagship products that showed it. But I think at MAX we clearly announced that not only would we bring -- bringing our flagship products like Photoshop to the iPad, but in addition to that, we would be doing brand-new products that took advantage of this media like Project Gemini, where people would use a stylus and a tablet to draw. So we're well on our way on that journey. We're really excited about what we can do. We also showed, as you know, voice-enabled applications in XD that integrated with Echo. So if you start to think about a world where every single screen, you're going to be able to talk to that screen, we want to enable people to use our apps to create applications for that screen.","So that's on the MAX front, excited about it. But we're early in the journey, and we think there's a lot more that we can do that'll enable people to tell their story with ease. On the Digital Experience side with the Experience System of Record, I think the ODI announcement that we made in conjunction with SAP and Microsoft was the next step in that particular journey, where all three companies have talked about the need to have this Unified Customer Profile, where in realtime you can action it and you can integrate that with support systems, supply chain systems, financial systems and certainly the marketing systems, which is what we are pioneering. We made some good progress in that. The interest, honestly, in that is pretty high because every CIO has worried about, \"How do I get this Unified Customer Profile?\" So again, I would say that's a multiyear journey for us to deliver value. Our Experience Platform has already been delivered to customers. They're giving us feedback in realtime. Our applications, much like we did with the Creative Suite of products, will all build on top of the score content and data platform. But that's what we do, Jay. I mean, we are excited about the product journey and building deep technology moats. And so I would say off to a great start but there's so much more that we can do in terms of delivering value to our customers and further strengthening our differentiation against the competition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","I mean, Shantanu, I had actually two questions. You -- I think just to follow up on one -- something that Kash asked. I was wondering, given digital transformation is a top area of focus for years, I'm trying to get a sense for how resilient do you think the spending could be if the macro environment were to become more challenging. And then I had a follow-up on piracy.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Heather, my belief is that the customers, there's no way that customer expectations are going to change in terms of how they transact businesses with enterprise. And as you know, when -- if economic climate changes, there's even more reason to prioritize on the first few imperatives that are essential. And so if you just look at what's happening with mobile devices as the only form of interaction with enterprises, we just continue to think that digital will be very important and very central to the C-level mandate. So that gives us confidence that we need to continue to drive it. I mean, we will certainly monitor what happens if there is, but you don't want this to become a self-fulfilling prophecy, where everybody says, \"Hey, what do we do if there's a slowdown and then people cut spending?\" We haven't seen that so far. So that's how I would describe this as a priority. And we help with the top line driving revenue for customers. And so I think that's the important part of our mandate and offering.","Heather Bellini","Right. So for the CEOs you talk to or the CMOs, it's much more been about the fear of not spending because of their competitors' spend than they're falling further behind. Is that kind of the way to think about it?","Shantanu Narayen","That's exactly the way to think about it, and it's also the way they -- every one of them knows that if they are not using digital as an enabler, there's some small company out there that's going to completely disrupt their business using a mobile app and digital technology. So the heightened importance of digital I think is there front and center for every enterprise.","Heather Bellini","Great. And then just the last one would just be a follow-up on your comments on piracy and you've mentioned some good success that you're having there. Is there a way to help think about the tailwinds that this could add to your Creative business?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, I think we've seen that, Heather, right through our journey. The affordability of Creative Cloud from day one has been one of the drivers of the new growth, our new customer acquisition that we've highlighted every year, including at MAX. And so I think that continues to give us confidence. I think the pricing upfront, which allows more people to enter the platform, I think that's another way in which we are combating piracy. And third is the fact that we don't have boxes. They used to be a real gray market associated with selling our boxes. That's also gone away. That's not to say that people aren't finding ways to somehow get their hands on Creative Cloud. And our brand continues to be strong even in areas where there are malicious users of our product. But we've -- we made significant traction, and we continue to focus on driving value through services. And I would say a step function for us, as all of these assets are in the cloud, then they become DOA unless you're a legitimate user of Adobe products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Maybe one for John, so he doesn't feel completely left out on this call. If we strip out the acquired assets, Marketo in particular, how are you thinking about sort of operating leverage within sort of the core Adobe businesses into FY '19? Do you think this is another year where you could see the nice expansion that you have been seeing in the underlying operating margins? Or is there like a broader investment, that core going on for -- through FY '19 as well?","John Murphy","Thanks very much, Keith. I think when you think about our core business, we have that operating leverage as we've shared throughout FY '18 before the acquisitions. And what we tried to articulate in the prepared remarks was that because the accounting implications coming with the acquisitions for purchase accounting, you have this first -- really the kind of first half to third quarter impact of deferred revenue, for instance, on the operating side. And as that tapers off during the year, we believe the leverage on our model continues to return to growth in terms of operating margins. And so we see that expanding as we exit the year into familiar territory that I think you've seen before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein.","Mark Moerdler","Can you give us a sense of where you are in the journey of Acrobat's subscription and how to think about the negative impact of the move of perpetual license subscriptions on the Document Cloud revenue growth?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Mark, as you know, we have actually used a different strategy for Acrobat than we used for Creative Cloud because in that particular business, perpetual just continues to be an important area of both new customer acquisition for us as well as I think we've done a good job of bridging. And so you've clearly seen -- now the business continues to do well. We talk about the unit growth that we're seeing in Acrobat. And so we don't particularly see a headwind as it relates to perpetual moving to subscriptions the way we saw in the Creative. We just want to continue to focus on driving more unit growth, and that's really our focus. What is still a big opportunity, however, which may be the other part of your question, is that there's a larger and larger installed base that as we add more value in the services and apply our AI services, that'll continue to be a forward-looking opportunity for us with document. So I think that's all factored and tailored in the targets that we provided for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","So trade negotiations with China are dominating the headlines. If we actually see an agreement that brings true IP protection and a real open market in China, how big could that market be for Adobe? What could that do to your revenue and revenue growth going forward?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Sterling, one way you can look at it is you can say what this the number of PCs and mobile devices that are used in China and how does that compare to what's being used in the U.S. And if you look at what our revenue is in the U.S., I mean, that would, I think, at the high end show the potential of what that could be because creativity is just as important in China. And you could actually argue, we're one of the few companies, U.S. technology companies, that really doesn't have an alternative in China, so we feel good about it. But even if those trade agreements that you allude to happen, I think it would take a little while for that to completely translate into our business. So having said that, the China business for us has been doing well. As you know, we introduced CC. We focused on the team offering because we thought that would be the right beachhead for us to focus on. And the other area that we focus on is our company is doing business in China. How do we make sure that they have a site license, so to speak, or enterprise license agreement that allows us to do it? So from a purely mathematical and installed base perspective, it's massive how that translates. We have been clearly baked any of that sort of inflection point or dramatic shift into our numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Brent Bracelin","I wanted to follow up on the operating margin question that Keith kind of went down. And taking a little bit of a different tack here, full year operating margins have risen by more than 200 basis points, I think, for five consecutive years. You're now above 40%, phenomenal kind of progress here, highest in over 10 years. My question is going forward. I get the first half accounting impact. But as you think about the opportunity in the $70 billion Experience Cloud, do you plan to invest incremental dollars to accelerate the share in the Experience Cloud? Or do you think you can actually drive margins well above 40% on a blended basis?","John Murphy","Great. Thanks very much, Brent. I think when you look at the Digital Experience business, we've always long believed that, that business can actually have margins typical of a SaaS business. We continue to invest in the Digital Experience, of course, obviously recently with the two acquisitions. And so our goal there is to help them integrate to make sure that they can accelerate our growth in that space. That market's huge. So as we continue to invest in that market, certainly we want to see op earnings leverage in it, and it'll be healthy for the business overall. If we look at top line growth and we look at bottom line growth really is what we're trying to drive. And so our long-term model has always been to grow our earnings as fast as our top line or faster. So once we kind of get past this noise of accounting through the year, more so in the first half and then it trails off in the third and fourth quarter, you'll see the operating margin for the total company kind of return to historical levels.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Tom Roderick with Stifel.","Thomas Roderick","So the company took some pricing up here last March in Creative Cloud, I guess just in North America. But would love it if you could provide just a little bit of feedback as to how the price bumps that were put in place have been received by both new and installed customers. And can you add any color there as to whether you've seen any changes to net dollar retention stemming from the price bumps? Just overall some color on how this has gone would be great.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. I think it's gone completely in line with our expectations. I mean, we have just a significant amount of experience with that. As you know, we look at FX in other countries as well to also look at pricing. So it's not the first time that we have made changes to Creative Cloud pricing since the time it was introduced. From our perspective, it was on the heels of MAX, where we introduced 5 new products, which was the sort of most significant innovation after the original introduction. We continue to be focused on a lot more innovation driving value for our customers and I think you'll continue to see it. But North America went very much in line with our expectations. And as we said, our goal is to continue to drive new customers to the platform. That remains front and center but nothing that I would say is to doubt in our experience. And I think that's just because of the diligence that we did, which is we're thoughtful about it. We want to continue to attract customers to the platform with promotional pricing and deliver them the value, which enables us to give more credence to whatever pricing changes we might do.","But since the last question, I mean, I'll also start off by wishing everybody on the call happy holidays. Thank you all for joining us. We're certainly thrilled with Q4 and FY '18. I think we had a very, very strong year. And I think it's a clear indication that our strategy of empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is working. We think it represents, as we have said at our MAX financial analyst meeting, a massive addressable market opportunity, and the FY '19 financial targets reflect the momentum that we expect to continue to drive across all offerings and geographies. And we're excited about the product innovation road map that we have for all of our customers. And again, wanted to thank you all for joining us today.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd look to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe's President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen; as well as Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO. ","In the call today, we'll discuss Adobe's first quarter fiscal year 2012 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release, which crossed the wire approximately 1 hour ago. If you need a copy of the press release, you can go to Adobe.com under the Company and Newsroom links to find an electronic copy. ","Before we get started, I want to emphasize that some of the information discussed in this call, particularly our revenue and operating model targets and our forward-looking product plans, is based on information as of today, March 19, 2012, and contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in such statements. For discussion of these risks and uncertainties, you should review the forward-looking statements disclosure in the earnings press release we issued today as well as Adobe's SEC filings. ","During this call, we will discuss GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the 2 is available in today's earnings release and on our Investor Relations website in the investor data sheet. Call participants are advised that the audio of this conference call is being broadcast live over the Internet in Adobe Connect and is also being recorded for playback purposes. An archive of the call will be made available on Adobe's Investor Relations website for approximately 45 days and is the property of Adobe Systems. The audio and archive may not be rerecorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe Systems. ","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mike, and good afternoon. Q1 revenue was within our targeted range for the quarter. We also achieved solid Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share as well as strong cash flow and growth in deferred revenue. At the outset of this year, we outlined our strategy to double down in 2 fast-growing markets, Digital Media and Digital Marketing. ","In our Digital Media business, our strategy is to help customers create, publish and monetize their content on any device. Demand is building for our upcoming Creative Suite and Creative Cloud launches. And as a result, Creative Suite revenue was lower than expected in Q1. ","In our Digital Marketing business, our strategy is to help marketers measure, manage and optimize their marketing investments for maximum return. Momentum continued with our Digital Marketing Suite during Q1 with year-over-year revenue growth exceeding 30%. ","In our Digital Media business, recent research shows our customers are excited about our upcoming launch of Creative Suite and the Creative Cloud. Among Creative professional customers and students, we found that over 40% of those surveyed are waiting for the new release to upgrade. Our upcoming Creative Suite release will include major updates to all of the core CS products, including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, InDesign, Illustrator and Dreamweaver. We have created significant anticipation for the release through a series of sneak peeks of great new features. One sneak featured a breakthrough Photoshop innovation called Content-Aware Move, which has driven more than 1 million online viewers on the YouTube Photoshop channel. ","The upcoming CS release will also advance our HTML5 and mobile content creation and app development offerings where we see strong interest to help our customers deal with the complexity they face. All of this is on track for delivery late in Q2. ","We continue to extend the creative process for tablets. We recently announced availability of Adobe Photoshop Touch for the iPad. Photoshop Touch, which is also available on Android tablets, offers core Photoshop features as well as new capabilities for creating and sharing images in an app custom built for tablets. Photoshop Touch is a central component of the Adobe Touch Apps, joining other popular iOS apps such as Adobe Revel and Adobe Ideas. New and updated versions of our 6 touch apps will be coming throughout this year. ","In conjunction with our upcoming Creative Suite release, we will launch Adobe Creative Cloud, which will transform the creative process. Creative Cloud includes all of our key CS desktop products, web services such as online storage, Typekit for online fonts, Business Catalyst for website hosting e-commerce, connectivity with our new touch apps and powerful collaboration and social community features. With the subscription model, Creative Cloud users will also get frequent product updates and access to new, innovative solutions, such as Edge and Muse, for HTML5 content creation. ","We believe Creative Cloud will transform our business model and drive higher revenue growth over time. This will happen through an expansion of our customer base by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry as well as keeping existing customers current on our latest release. Success with this model will drive our revenue to be more recurring and predictable. We will continue to offer the perpetual licensing model as we transition our customers to this new subscription model. ","Our Digital Publishing solution continued its strong momentum. As of Q1, approximately 600 publishers have delivered more than 1,500 applications for devices like the iPad, generating 16 million downloads of their apps. Using our analytics capabilities that help publishers understand the use of their apps, we recently announced that time spent by users of these digital publications has increased 70% over the last 6 months. We attribute this growth to the more sophisticated and engaging content publishers are delivering, as well as the continued adoption of tablets. We expect this growth to continue, particularly with the inclusion of the Single Edition of Digital Publishing in our Creative Cloud offering later this year and the upcoming release of InDesign with its innovative liquid layout capabilities. ","In February, we announced the industry's first fully integrated digital video solution to power TV-like experiences for ad-driven videos via the Web. Code-named Project Primetime, this new solution delivers premium video and ad content consistently across all major platforms, including Apple iOS, Google Android, desktop operating systems and connected TVs. ","Primetime is an end-to-end workflow that interconnects Adobe's streaming technologies, content protection, analytics and optimization with our recently acquired Auditude video advertising platform. For Adobe, it places us in the center of helping move premium video content and ad dollars online and represents a larger opportunity across many of our business areas. ","Earlier this month, we introduced Lightroom 4, a major release of our digital photography workflow solution, helping amateur and professional photographers quickly import, manage, enhance and showcase their images. We lowered the price to broaden the potential user base for this market-leading product, and feedback and reviews and social commentary for the new release has been outstanding. ","On Adobe Labs, we recently introduced Adobe Shadow for web designers and developers working on mobile projects. This new product enables easy pairing, synchronous browsing and efficient multi-device preview during mobile content creation and mobile app development. Adobe Shadow demonstrates our ongoing HTML5 innovation effort and leadership in the web community and addresses a critical need of designers and developers dealing with the complexity of digital media on multiscreens. ","In Digital Marketing, we closed the acquisition of Efficient Frontier in January. This is a significant milestone as we continue to build out the value we are providing to digital marketers. Efficient Frontier predictably optimizes how to spend marketing dollars across search, display and social media platforms. It provides an ad buying capability for Facebook, offers real-time bidding for display advertising and expands our Digital Marketing Suite with a social marketing engagement platform to help customers manage their brand presence across the social Web. In Q1, customer acquisition momentum continued with our Digital Marketing Suite. Key customer wins included Fox, J. Crew, Electronic Arts, Samsung, British Petroleum, Citibank and Kohl's. ","This week, we are hosting our Annual Digital Marketing Summit in Salt Lake City to an audience of approximately 4,000, nearly double the attendance last year. We will present our strategy and announce new solutions to lead in the fast-growing categories of social marketing, multichannel campaign execution, analytics and personalized experiences. ","Later, I'll have some closing comments. Now I'll turn it over to Mark for a more detailed discussion of our Q1 results. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, Adobe achieved revenue of $1,045,000,000. This compares to $1,028,000,000 reported in Q1 fiscal 2011 and $1,152,000,000 reported last quarter. In mid-January, we closed the acquisition of Efficient Frontier, and our Q1 results include $9.6 million in Efficient Frontier revenue. ","Q1 GAAP operating expenses were $648 million compared to $617.7 million reported in Q1 fiscal 2011 and $789.7 million last quarter. Non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 were $571.3 million compared to $539.5 million reported for Q1 fiscal 2011 and $611.9 million last quarter. ","In Q1, Adobe's effective tax rate was 31.5% on a GAAP basis and 22.5% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate was higher than our targeted rate primarily due to a onetime charge related to our acquisition of Efficient Frontier. Offsetting this charge were tax benefits related to an extension of a favorable state tax ruling and the resolution of some audits in our favor in Q1. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower than targeted due to the state ruling. ","GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 fiscal 2012 were $0.37. This compares with GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.46 reported in Q1 fiscal 2011 and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.35 reported last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for Q1 fiscal 2012 were $0.57. This compares with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.58 in Q1 fiscal 2011 and $0.67 reported last quarter. The mid-quarter addition of Efficient Frontier revenue and costs did not have a material impact on Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share results. ","I will now discuss Adobe's results in Q1 by business segment. As a reminder, we adjusted our business segments effective with the beginning of our 2012 fiscal year. Our FY 2011 10-K and the updated investor data sheet we provided in January reflect the segment changes. ","Digital Media segment revenue in Q1 was $730.3 million compared to $761.1 million in Q1 fiscal 2011 and $827.3 million last quarter. Creative Suite revenue was lower than expected in Q1 with demand building for our Q2 launch of Creative Suite and Creative Cloud. ","Within the Digital Media segment, Document Services revenue was up $183.3 million compared to $184.6 million in Q1 fiscal 2011 and $203.7 million last quarter. Acrobat was in line with our expectations. ","Digital Marketing segment revenue in Q1 was $259.9 million compared to $212.9 million in Q1 fiscal 2011 and $269.8 million last quarter. Within the Digital Marketing segment, Digital Marketing Suite revenue grew 33% year-over-year, helped by the mid-quarter addition of Efficient Frontier, which contributed $9.6 million of revenue in Q1. Excluding Efficient Frontier, Digital Marketing Suite revenue grew 26% year-over-year. LiveCycle and Connect performed better than expected, contributing $85.6 million to Q1 revenue. ","Finally, Print and Publishing segment revenue was $55 million compared to $53.7 million in Q1 fiscal 2011 and $55.1 million last quarter. ","Turning to our geographic segments in Q1, results on a percent of revenue basis were as follows: the Americas, 48%; Europe, 32%; Asia, 20%. The demand environment remained stable in all of our major geographies. ","From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $7.7 million. We had $10.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '12 versus no hedge gains in Q1 FY '11. Thus, the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $18 million. ","From a quarter-over-quarter perspective, FX decreased revenue by $5.2 million. We had $10.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY '12 versus a $3.6 million hedge gain in Q4 FY '11. Thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains, was $1.5 million. ","Employees at the end of Q1 totaled 9,963 versus 9,925 at the end of last quarter. Our trade DSO was 45 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter and 50 days last quarter. ","During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $314.4 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $2.8 billion compared to $2.9 billion at the end of Q4. The decline was primarily due to our acquisition of Efficient Frontier. Our ending deferred revenue balance increased by $17 million to $549 million. ","In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares at a total cost of $53 million. Entering Q2, $225 million of stock repurchase authority remains against the $1.6 billion stock repurchase authorization announced in July of 2010. ","This concludes my discussion of our results. I would now to like to discuss our financial targets. ","In Q2, we are targeting a revenue range between $1,090,000,000 and $1,140,000,000. This factors a full quarter of Efficient Frontier revenue, the revenue tail for CS5.5 in advance of CS6 and delivery of CS6 and Creative Cloud late in Q2. ","At the midpoint of the Q2 targeted range, we expect our Digital Media segment to grow sequentially with the launch. In our Digital Marketing segment, we expect Digital Marketing Suite revenue to grow sequentially with Efficient Frontier contributing approximately $15 million in Q2 and legacy Enterprise product revenue declining sequentially by approximately $30 million. We expect Print and Publishing to be relatively flat. ","We are targeting a Q2 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.37 to $0.43 per share and a Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.57 to $0.61. In addition, we are targeting our Q2 share count to be 502 million to 504 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $19 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 GAAP tax rate of 23.5% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5%. ","For the full year, we are increasing our annual revenue growth target to a range of 6% to 8% to reflect the addition of Efficient Frontier and approximately $60 million to $80 million of revenue. By quarter, we expect Q3 revenue to increase sequentially from Q2 due to a full quarter benefit from the Creative products, which shipped late in Q2. We would also expect Q4 revenue to increase sequentially from Q3 due to normal Q4 seasonality. ","With the acquisition of Efficient Frontier, our full year GAAP diluted earnings per share targeted range moves to $1.63 to $1.73, and our non-GAAP EPS diluted earnings per share targeted range increases to $2.38 to $2.48. ","This concludes my section. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mark. Our vision at Adobe is to change the world through digital experiences. In Digital Media, we believe our upcoming CS and Creative Cloud releases will transform the creative process and create a new inflection point for revenue growth for the next several years. In Digital Marketing, we're building the foundation for a high-growth SaaS business with the most compelling value proposition in the industry. We continue to execute well against our objectives in this space, and the next few days, at our Digital Marketing Summit in Utah, will be another proof point that this business will positively impact our growth. Adobe is well positioned in these 2 large markets, and we are confident in our ability to execute against that strategy. ","Thank you for joining us today.

","We will now be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Brent Thill of UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question for Shantanu and Mark. Shantanu, just on CS. You mentioned it didn't achieve your goal. Is that, in your sense, it was just pent-up demand ahead of CS6? Or is there a competitive issue that you perhaps haven't seen? And for Mark, if you could just talk through the deferred revenue? You had a pretty strong increase year-on-year, how we shouldn't expect that trajectory going forward?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. So Brent, as it relates to CS6 and really the entire quarter, we did have solid earnings both in Acrobat as well as in the Digital Marketing. So as Mark mentioned in his prepared remarks, the demand that we saw in general across geographies was stable. We started to market the new release for CS and the Creative Cloud more aggressively in Q1. And frankly, that's a little earlier than in previous cycles because there were a number of inbound customer requests for features, both on desktop products as well as the information around the Creative Cloud. And we also did some survey in the demand, and it was clear that the demand for CS6 is more than in prior cycles. And that's what sort of led to this decline in revenue for CS5.5. And that was really in February. And so from our point of view, 5.5 accomplished its key objectives. We were trying to transition the business to an annual cycle. We extended the CS5 cycle so that it exceeded beyond CS3. And now, clearly, what customers are telling us is that they are exciting about CS6. So it's not a competitive issue, and it's really excitement around our new offering.","Mark Garrett","And Brent, on the deferred revenue, you're right. We did have a nice pop in deferred revenue this quarter. That's mainly driven by a lot of Omniture renewals. This is the quarter where a lot of their contracts renew. We also start building up some free-of-charge upgrade deferral for CS6 and for Lightroom 4. So bottom line, I think you should expect that deferred revenue continues to increase. I think you've seen that trend for quite some time now.","Operator","And we'll move next to Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Shantanu, just wondering on the CS6 timing. You said late in the quarter. I'm just wondering. As we look at past releases, especially major releases, should we expect it to unfold very much the way in terms of timing in the quarter as well as the release of the product in various major geographies?","Shantanu Narayen","Walter, I -- when we said late in Q2, that is in line with the plan that we had set, so there's no issue with respect to the internal execution against that project. I would say it's probably a little bit later than you would have seen in prior releases. As we move to the annual cycle, we want to make sure that we get both the desktop products as well as the Creative Cloud offering available at the same time. So I would say it's a little later in the quarter than in prior cycles. As it relates to international releases, again, we are moving increasingly to a simultaneous release in the major geographies, which, in addition to the U.S., tend to be the U.K., Germany and Japan and France. So expect to see that. But again, as Mark said, most of the revenue, we'll actually start to see in Q3, and you will see some of it in Q2.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then just relative to margin in the [indiscernible] business, your commentary was, I guess, you're calling it Document Services now. Your commentary was that was in line. And I know you did recap the numbers. So I just want to make sure we're looking at the right thing here. It looks like that business last quarter was up about 18% year-over-year. I know you had some pricing that we thought you anniversary-ed last quarter. And it looks like it was about flat year-over-year this quarter, but it sounds like in line. Just wondering if you could help us understand why such a severe deceleration in that growth rate and yet it was still in line.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Walter, I think there, it had to do more with the traditional Enterprise sales cycles where you see a rise in Q4 as a result of everything we're building up. And then again, so there's the run rate business and the Enterprise business. Demand for Acrobat and Document Services continues to be stable. You traditionally see a big uptake in Q4 through the sales cycle and then you start again. So everything -- that's why we wanted to clarify it's in line with our expectations. As it relates to the Document Services itself, the EchoSign as well as the other online services, they're proceeding well. Not a material part but certainly significant growth year-over-year.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And just, Mark, a clarification on that around year-over-year growth rates, which is what I was looking at now sequentially. I mean, you did see, I think, an 18% year-over-year growth rate in Q4, and then you saw basically a flat year-over-year growth rate in Q1. So sort of both are assuming the seasonality of their respective quarters but definitely a change in the year-over-year growth rate. Are we looking at something wrong there?","Mark Garrett","No, you're not looking at something wrong. I mean, we're still very confident in the Acrobat business. It's getting late in the cycle, but it's a great product and it met our expectations just like what we said.","Operator","We'll move next to Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Just a follow-up on an earlier question about the CS business. Specifically, if we go to CS5.5, the subscription offering, which I know is specific to adobe.com and only a small slice of the business, being that those customers, I assume, were entitled to CS6 upon release, can you tell us anything maybe from subscriber metrics or even anecdotally about the health of that portion of the business?","Shantanu Narayen","So Brad, as it relates to the CS offering, CS6 will really be the first time that we go to market on a global basis with an aggressive launch of subscriber metrics. So as we've said at our analyst meeting, we certainly expect to give you more data once the CS6 launches. Maybe I can speak a little bit to the comprehensive plan that we have to market the new release of Creative products and what you might expect. First, again, let me reiterate that we think the transition risk is really minimized as a result of offering perpetual with the subscription base. All the math that we have done shows that the more we convert the existing customer base over to a recurring revenue, we are able to grow the business. I think that individuals and specifically new users will be likely the early adopters for the subscription and Enterprise will probably stay longest with the current perpetual offering. And so we have offerings not just on adobe.com. You can expect to see us offer subscription also through the other online and e-tail stores in the market. And for Enterprise offers, specifically, we'll continue to offer Enterprise licensing agreements. So while all of this gets launched in Q2, we continue to think that we have a really comprehensive go-to-market to attract new customers and not introduce any risk in the business.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Helpful, Shantanu. Just in follow-up to that, can you give us any sense of what the metrics you're thinking of sharing with the Street? The revenue guidance into next quarter is very helpful, but, obviously, through this transition, it's also going to be helpful to get a sense of what you're targeting for subscribers or what have you that you're going to look to manage the business by.","Shantanu Narayen","So again, at the analyst meeting, we had talked about how we can get new unit adoption. I think subscriber growth will be clearly one of the metrics that we are measuring internally. And the third one will be for customers who exist, what are the churn rates. So directionally, those are the 3. I think starting -- as the offering gets delivered, we'll certainly start to share more of that information with you, Brad.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Great. And if I could just sneak in a quick one for Mark. Mark, the LiveCycle guidance to be down $150 million this year. Clearly, this quarter and then your guidance for next look better than that. Does that expectation still stand?","Mark Garrett","It's probably going to be better than $150 million down, Brad, just based on what we saw in the first quarter. It did end up being better than we had anticipated, and Q2 looks a little better than we anticipated. So it'll probably be a little better than the $150 million.","Shantanu Narayen","I should just add, though, that what we have done is all of the OpEx changes that we were going to make to help us focus on Digital Marketing, those are all behind us. And so now, clearly, we've represented to the existing customers what we are doing with respect to both government and financial services. So plan's on track with respect to how we transition-focus within the company, Brad.","Operator","We'll move next to Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just kind of following on that first question there. Without getting into maybe what you think specific subaccounts, et cetera, will be, can you just talk about the pace at which you expect to see Creative Cloud adoption? And in general, what percent of revenue you would classify as recurring today? And where you think that'll be 2 years from now?","Mark Garrett","Yes, Mike, it's Mark. So we expect the pace to be relatively not slow, but I think it's going to take a little while. I think people are going to want to see the product, understand what we can offer. I think there will be people that will wait till we iterate on the product. So while we're very excited about it and we expect to transition more and more people to the cloud-based offering, it's going to take a little bit of time. In terms of recurring revenue, if you remember last year, we had been saying that we were running around 20%-ish in terms of our recurring revenue. That's actually picked up now to over 23%. So we're making good progress on that recurring revenue front. That's a combination of subscription revenue from the Omniture business, from Efficient Frontier, from Connect hosted, from the subscriptions that we have on CS today that includes maintenance and support as well. So we're making good progress towards driving that recurring revenue percentage up.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Do you think that pace is reasonable, like a few percentage points per year?","Mark Garrett","We'll have to see what the adoption on CS is, to be honest with you. But I do expect that it will continue to grow every year.","Operator","We'll move next to Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Mark, just actually I'd like to follow up on Mike's line of questioning there. Regarding just moving the enterprises over on to the subscription, Shantanu, maybe you've had some time to talk to some of these people. What is it that they are looking for to get more comfortable to maybe adopt subscription? And do you need to offer some sort of subscription volume pricing to entice them economically to move?","Shantanu Narayen","Steve, those are both good questions. Let me maybe again talk a little bit about what is coming in the next version so to set the stage for what we are going to do as it relates to pricing and what we are hearing from customers. The first thing is clearly, with Imaging and Photoshop, it's not been updated for close to 2 years. And that's our longest gap in a Photoshop release and with significant more features. So folks are really excited about what's coming in imaging. On the HTML5 side, the innovation with new products like Edge and Muse, as well as mobile application development, I know you've asked me in the past what's happening with developers. PhoneGap's being downloaded, for example, at almost 1 million a year run rate. On the Publishing side, we've continued to make InDesign a must-have to go with the Digital Publishing Suite so that enterprises can deal with multiple screens. And so we offer that again as part of an Enterprise ELA. Video. High-end video, we're now the leader. And clearly, in the next release, there's significant new innovation that's happening in the video market. And the Flash HTML compatibility, we have millions of Flash developers who will be able to continue to innovate using Flash and easily convert to HTML using Create GS [ph] capabilities. We've demonstrated that as well. So Steve, once we go in with this entire value proposition, frankly, for the enterprises, what they're interested in doing, as they do today, is an enterprise-wide license for all of the desktop applications. They get all of the Touch applications in conjunction with that. They want content management so that they can have a collaborative authoring process. So typically, we go on in and either offer Day content management as well as we're going to be providing a digital asset management solution for the enterprise later this year. And then they can also then provide all of this external to the firewall through the Creative Cloud offering. And so for enterprises, it's typically, again, a per-user basis in terms of the pricing, and that will continue with the Creative Cloud offering as being areas of interest for them. So we don't actually anticipate that it'll be a big issue for enterprises.","Operator","Next, we move to Ross MacMillan of Jefferies & Co.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","When you guys sort of extended the upgrade path for the CS3 and CS4 users, did that change your thoughts around the mix between who might go to an upgrade and who might go to subscription? And the reason I'm asking this is to try to get a sense for whether -- because it doesn't seem like anything changed in your underlying assumptions for the Creative and Digital Media business relative to where you've started last time.","Shantanu Narayen","No, Ross, there are no underlying assumption changes. Frankly, most of the customers have been telling us they're excited about CS6, and they said, \"Can we have a little bit more time to evaluate all of the offerings?\" And so all our modeling shows the more we convert existing customers to the Creative Cloud, the better off we are. Again, I think new users will be the primary usage of subscription. That's what we've seen in all of the pilots that we're running. Piracy will be one of the issues that we hope to address with the cloud offering, better pricing for people to adopt the platform. And I think customers who've been relatively current with our products will probably continue with the perpetual. What I will say also is that we have actually a very healthy road map of features that we're going to be providing on the cloud. So we show that sustained innovation and continue to promote the cloud as a better offering long term.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And maybe just to follow up. Can we expect to see other sort of segmented products offered on a cloud basis with the CS6 release? Or will it really just be the full Creative Cloud and segmentation of the offering will come later?","Shantanu Narayen","Our current thinking is to offer the individual products that's turned out to be a great on-ramp for people want to use it and then to offer the Creative Cloud, which is the comprehensive offering of all of our tools. That is not to say that some of the services that we offer will not be charged separately. So I think you'll see individual point products offered through subscription, you'll see comprehensive offering and you'll see other services for which we might charge separately.","Operator","Next, we'll move to Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is about the annual guidance. It looks like the delta to the midpoint is sort of towards the upper end for what we thought Efficient Frontier might actually be. Does that mean that you're sort of tweaking out implicitly some of other businesses? And if so, what would that be? Or do you have just better feel for Efficient Frontier?","Mark Garrett","I mean, I think if you net it out, we just have a better feel for Efficient Frontier. We're very happy with the CS6 release, as we had talked about earlier on the call. We\u2019re very excited about the subscription offering. But basically, we're reiterating the guidance that we had for the rest of the business, and then adding a more comfortable commitment to Efficient Frontier on top of that.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Perfect. And then if I could just go back to the LiveCycle business? Somebody asked a question on this before, but holding up a lot better than we thought, certainly, going through a transition. Why do you think that is?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Adam, I would say first that there are a significant number of customers who have adopted LiveCycle, and I think they've started to feel more comfortable with at least the support plan that we have for them. So we had certainly modeled what would happen with maintenance, and that has actually turned out to be more positive than we had originally modeled. And in government and financial services, as people continue to have LiveCycle, there may be a little bit of acquiring enough licenses to keep them going. But we've done the right thing by changing the focus, and I think customers are comfortable with the support that we've put in place for existing customers.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And just a follow-up on that transition. Your headcount growth was pretty modest quarter-on-quarter. So you said earlier you're through all of the headcount changes on the Enterprise side. Is that sort of what the net impact is there? Why is it so little? Or is there something else at play?","Mark Garrett","Yes, I think what you're -- well, what you are seeing there, Adam, is 2 things. One is the addition of Efficient Frontier, and that's offset by the restructuring that we took last year.","Operator","And we'll move next to Peter Goldmacher with Cowen and Company.","Peter L. Goldmacher - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I want to switch gears a little bit to the Digital Marketing business. You talked about refocusing on that business and retraining some of your expenses on that business. Can you give us an update operationally on what you're spending your money on and how you're thinking about investing in that business for the next year?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Peter, and I'll make another pitch for the Digital Marketing Summit. As I said, we have close to 4,000 attendees, which is double the number of attendees, almost, from last year. So the interest in the Digital Marketing business is actually really high. There are 4 key areas in Digital Marketing. The first is analytics, and we will continue to focus on analytics. Mobile and traffic on mobile is increasing. So we actually continue to see a fair number of transactions. There's a new field that's emerging there called cross-visit analytics. So you'll see us do more with social cross-visit, and the core area of analytics and measurement, I think, will continue to be a healthy area for us. The second is going to be all about personalized engagement. These are people who are rethinking their web presence, moving their business online. Virtually every CMO that I talk to wants a new interactive experience online. So that's an area with their -- Day Software as the core offering that we have in there as Day moves to the cloud. As we offer more functionality for people to be able to deal with social sites, that's another area of focus for us. The third, I would say, is multichannel campaign execution. This is where Efficient Frontier really helps in us being able to predict how you should spend your money online and get a -- get better ROI for everything that you're spending. And the fourth is media monetization, which is everything to do with, if you are a publisher, how do you make sure that all of the assets that you have and you're moving online, you are effectively monetizing it. So whether you're a marketer who wants an online presence, whether you're an advertiser who wishes to optimize your ad spend or whether you're a publisher who wishes to optimize your inventory, I think we now have a really comprehensive offering across each one of them. And again, you'll get a lot more details about that next -- this week.","Mark Garrett","And then from an -- sorry, from an investment perspective, the big push has been to add sales capacity. We've organized the field now such that they're integrated with the rest of the Adobe sales force. And we continue to add sales capacity in that business to drive revenue.","Peter L. Goldmacher - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And when you're adding sales capacity, is it one person selling everything? Or are there divisions by products? Do you have an orderly [ph] organization? There are specialists? How does that all look?","Shantanu Narayen","So Peter, what we did at the beginning of the year is we started to have a single Digital Marketing Suite that integrated all these offerings, the majority of the current sales force that is selling direct into Enterprise will have in their basket all of this combined offering. For some of the newer products, we will always continue to have a specialized sales force to make sure that we get attention on nascent businesses or the ones that are growing really rapidly.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sounds like this is the last transition quarter you guys sound -- talking about the CS6 cycle ahead, although you're not willing to quite dial the guidance up all the way. Certainly, it sounds like you guys are excited about it. My question is HTML5, what kind of new opportunities are open to Adobe that you could not pursue with the CS5? And could this lead to a little bit more of a higher sense of urgency in what has been a typical normal upgrade cycle? I'm just wondering if people have to upgrade their product a little bit more rapidly than prior cycles to keep up with the demands being posed by HTML5? And also, secondly, if you can, what gives you the confidence that the offering, the subscription, will not derail the core business model of the company?","Shantanu Narayen","So Kash, I thought there were 3 questions in that. First, as it relates to the excitement around the CS6, yes, I outlined a number of the reasons. Imaging continues to be very high among what people are looking for with the next release. But the second one is HTML5. I'll give you a flavor of a couple of things. As I said, PhoneGap's on track. I think we had the most number of unique visitors to PhoneGap. So as people are creating applications across multiple app stores, that's continuing to gain traction. So we now have support for that, both as new services that we'll introduce as well as in Dreamweaver and our other applications. EaselJS, yes, that's some innovative, new functionality that we've also provided. So the millions of Flash developers who are out there, they can now, with a single button with the next version, not only output Flash, but they can also output HTML that will work within browsers. And so it actually enhances their productivity. And so while we continue to see the new version of Angry Birds taking advantage of Flash with Stage 3D, suddenly the same tool opens up new vistas for all of these Flash developers to develop animated or interactive content for HTML5. Edge and Muse, our brand-new applications. So I think we have a fair amount of new innovation to attract developers and designers to upgrade when the next release comes out.","Mark Garrett","And then in terms of the subscription not derailing the overall offering, from our perspective, by keeping the perpetual product choice for customers, we don't derail the CS6 launch at all. They still have the option to buy the perpetual product. If they really like the subscription and more people flock to the subscription than we anticipate, that would be a great problem to have. But like we said, we think adoption will be at a slower pace on the subscription offering.","Operator","And we'll move next to Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions. The first is you've now brought out a new revolver out there, but you haven't thrown the old one down for the past 8 quarters. Is there some new plans as to what you're expecting to do with the extra revolver? And the second question is going back to Creative Suite 6. Since you announced it earlier and now you've given people some more wiggle room till the end of the calendar year to move from CS3 and CS4 to CS6, isn't it possible that what you're going to do is effectively delay people moving to CS6 into the fourth quarter who might otherwise have moved either to CS5.5 in the third quarter or moved immediately to CS6 in the beginning of the third -- the end of the third quarter?","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Mark. Well, and so we'll split this up. So on the revolver, yes, we just basically closed out the old revolver and adopted a new one. It just extends basically our ability to have access to $1 billion in credit should we need it. It's really just good financial management from my perspective. The rates are very good. And if you remember, we actually did use it to help do the Omniture transaction a few years ago. So it's just opportunistic to have it in our coffers should we need it.","Shantanu Narayen","And on the second one, Mark, we feel confident that everything that we've shown customers, the long lead press, our advanced customers, the excitement and the value associated with CS, the next version, is going to be evident as soon as it ships. So we're confident. As I said again, imaging hasn't been updated for a long time. And the new features are very compelling.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Mark, a couple of modeling questions for you first. Several months ago when you first talked about the revenue profile for fiscal '12, in addition to the LiveCycle decline, you suggested that there would be about a $50 million to $100 million revenue delta due to ratability effects as compared with the what model would otherwise have been. Is it absolute the range of revenue delta that you foresee as you transition to the new model? Then a couple of follow-ups.","Mark Garrett","I don't think it was $100 million, Jay, when we did that. We said $150 million due to LiveCycle and Connect. And the difference between our original 4% to 6% guidance, and something that might have been closer to 8% to 10% without Efficient Frontier, was a combination of the LiveCycle and Connect decline as well as any impact from people moving to subscription. But it wasn't $100 million. We can do that quick math offline if you want.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second, a quick question for Shantanu. You mentioned a survey or some survey work that you had done a number of times. Considering the revenues per customer that you had talked about at the analyst meeting in terms of what you thought the customer value would be for perpetual license customers per month and subscriber customers per month, is there anything in that survey work that would suggest to you that perhaps there are some opportunities to tweak those numbers as you presented them to us as to the long-term value of those kinds of customers?","Shantanu Narayen","Jay, this survey was designed more to really understand interest in CS6 and resonance of the value proposition with customers across designers and developers and how much they knew about the product. So what was surprising was, first, the knowledge of CS6 was higher than what we've seen at similar cycles in the past. And that's clearly as a result of us doing more sneak peeks, which gave us confidence. And the second one was the actual number of people who said that they would upgrade was quite a bit higher than previous. In this particular survey, we didn't survey them for pricing, but we do have comprehensive pricing surveys that happen in Mark's organization. But this was just about interest level, understanding of the message and value proposition.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. Just 2 last quick ones for Mark. Under the new segments, you've got about a 67% gross margin on Digital Marketing or 70% in the most recent quarters, 67% last year, and 96% for Digital Media. Could you talk about the prospects for improving the gross margin in Digital Market? I assume that the services component of the Omniture business is weighing that down?","Mark Garrett","Well, there's 2 aspects to the Digital Marketing business that create that different profile from a gross margin perspective. One is the professional services business, although it is very profitable business the way it's run today. And then secondly is the servers around the world and just the hosting costs that you have to run that business. So in both of those, we continue to try to squeeze more gross profit out of those businesses, and I think we do have the opportunity to do that, especially on the server side of the business, as we consolidate colos [ph] around the world and drive virtualization on some of those servers.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And any comments on how Day did in the quarter versus the strength you saw in Q4 or how you're thinking about it for the fiscal year?","Shantanu Narayen","I -- the core Web Experience Management continues to be very healthy, Jay. It continues to, relative to our expectations, do better, and I think that's just as a result of people rethinking their entire content and delivery infrastructure. So the integration between that offering and analytics has also happened. We certainly expect to integrate that with everything we're doing on the social side, which is a big ask right now of CMOs. So continues to be sticky and a core part of the value proposition.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one quick housekeeping item. I'm just wondering what you expect in terms of the backlog this quarter. And then also just on to the Digital Marketing Suite, I mean, obviously, this is a sort of evolving space with multiple acquisitions by some of your competitors going on. But when you kind of put sort of your product set, some organic, some acquisition versus, let's say, what IBM is doing or salesforce or Oracle, what are the key differentiators in your mind especially as you kind of build this out going forward?","Mark Garrett","Hey, Phil, it's Mark. On the backlog question, we did not have any backlog coming in. We didn't have any backlog leaving. And we've talked about this during prior calls. We won't have backlog going forward anymore. We're managing the channel much more tightly, and it's just not going to be a material number going forward.","Shantanu Narayen","On your other question, Phil, as it relates to the differentiation in the Digital Marketing Suite, I think when you think about the entire content life cycle, nobody has as comprehensive an offering as Adobe. So much like we did on the Creative Suite, we have to have best-of-breed in each of the 4 segment areas that we talk about. In analytics, we're a market leader. In Web Experience Management, in media monetization as well as multichannel campaign. And so each of our offerings, I think, are best-in-class, and the integration of those is fairly unique in the industry. In addition, I think you'll see us announce some innovative, new things at Summit. And so it's clearly we're pushing the envelope on how people are thinking about marketing, which is, in addition to automation, how do you make sure it's more predictive. So really exciting things coming up ahead.","Operator","We'll move and take our final question from Chad Bartley with Pacific Crest.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask something that I think you guided to at the Analyst Day as it relates to the Digital Media segment. I think you talked about 5% to 7% growth in 2012. Is that still realistic as we think about our model and kind of the sequential ramp that you talked about in Q3, Q4?","Mark Garrett","Yes. I mean, like I said earlier, Chad, we have not changed our guidance of the core business with this 8% to 10%. We basically are reiterating that guidance and just adding Efficient Frontier to it. So we're still comfortable with that.","Chad Bartley - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, yes, I just want to make sure that, that applied to the Creative and the Knowledge Worker and the Acrobat business?","Mark Garrett","Yes, it does.","Shantanu Narayen","So I'd just like to again thank everybody for joining us today. I think in Digital Media, it really is all about the excitement around the innovation that we're going to be delivering later this quarter, both on the desktop side as well as our Touch applications and connected services. And we continue to be really excited about how we are transforming the creative process. And in Digital Marketing, we hope you can join us at the Digital Marketing Summit, where you'll continue to see how we're leading this really rapidly growing emerging category of businesses online. Thank you for joining us.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call. Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","And everyone, that does conclude our conference call for today.

Please go ahead.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today.

I'm pleased to report we delivered record revenue of $1,153,000,000 in Q4. This performance helped us achieve record revenue of $4.4 billion in fiscal year 2012.","At Adobe, we're focused on 2 large market opportunities: Digital Media and Digital Marketing. 2012 was a milestone year in terms of innovation with our Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud. We achieved great success in both these areas.","In the Digital Media business, we are redefining the creative process with Creative Cloud. Through frequent product and feature enhancements, new cloud services and attractive pricing, Adobe is changing how we provide value to a broader set of customers. We will deliver customized offerings for individuals, workgroups and large enterprises. As with all successful subscription services, we're offering a free trial program. This enables an easy on-ramp and a funnel of prospects that we intend to convert to paying subscribers.","Since we launched the individual Creative Cloud offering in May, we have already delivered 3 updates to the service. Earlier this year, we added Lightroom to the Creative Cloud, as well as new features for Dreamweaver and Illustrator. Since then, we have provided new HTML products, products, including Edge and Muse and this week, we delivered major feature enhancements to Photoshop and Digital Publishing Suite. We also introduced a sync and store capability, which will enable our creative customers to share and collaborate.","We're now shipping Creative Cloud for teams, which includes central administration of licenses, expert support, online training and collaboration features. Creative Cloud for enterprises, which we will deliver in 2013, integrates with Digital Publishing Suite and the Adobe Marketing Cloud, with digital asset management being an obvious area of integration.","We have begun transitioning enterprise customers to enterprise term license agreements, which provide them cloud services and updates to our desktop tools. Pricing for each segment is designed to reward loyal customers and aggressively transition them to the cloud.","Response to the Creative Cloud exceeded our expectations, helping us grow total Creative units by over 13%. As of the end of the year, we had 326,000 paid memberships and over 1 million free Creative Cloud members. As a result, in our Creative business, we exited FY '12 with $153 million in annualized recurring revenue. Based on overwhelmingly positive customer feedback, our results to date and the roadmap of new innovation planned for the coming year, we intend to accelerate customer transition to the Creative Cloud in 2013.","In Document Services, we launched Acrobat XI with newly integrated cloud services, including web contracting with Adobe EchoSign and forms creation, data collection and analysis with FormsCentral. Acrobat and these document services had record revenue in 2012.","Three years ago, we embarked on a strategy to create a new business for Adobe. Through organic innovation and acquisitions, we have become a market leader in the explosive digital marketing category. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization. We target chief marketing officers, chief revenue officers, advertising agencies, publishing executives and digital marketers with our solutions.","Our 5 Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions are architected to provide best-of-breed capabilities across analytics, online targeting, media optimization, social media and web experience management. By consolidating our 30 distinct offerings, we have simplified our messaging and made it easier for customers to license and implement our solutions. In addition to innovating on the product side, we intend to aggressively evangelize the benefits of digital in the evolution of marketing.","We believe Digital Marketing will be a multibillion-dollar category, and 2012 was a great year for Adobe as we established ourselves as the leader in analytics, online targeting and media optimization. In web experience management we have the fastest-growing solution in the space, doubling our market share over the past 2 years. As a result, we drove over $220 million of revenue in Q4 and achieved 35% annual revenue growth for the year.","In summary, 2012 was an outstanding year of accomplishments against our strategic priorities. We enter 2013 in a strong position.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mark.","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2012 results. Adobe achieved record revenue of $4,404,000,000 in the year compared to $4,216,000,000 in fiscal 2011. Our success in fiscal 2012 demonstrates significant progress toward our goal of transforming our business and building a predictable revenue stream. In 2012, 25% of our revenue was recurring, up from approximately 19% in fiscal year 2011.","In fiscal 2012, we added approximately 293,000 net new paid subscriptions. Using an ASP of $750, this achievement in subscriptions effectively transitions approximately $220 million of perpetual revenue to Creative Cloud during the year. Backing out recognized subscription revenue of $39 million, we would have achieved approximately $181 million more of revenue in FY '12. Additionally, moving to term-based enterprise license agreements transitioned approximately $19 million of FY '12 perpetual revenue. After these adjustments, we believe FY '12 revenue would have been approximately $4.6 billion, representing 9% year-over-year growth.","In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1,153,000,000, exceeding our targeted range of $1,075,000,000 to $1,125,000,000.","We continued to accelerate adoption of Creative Cloud subscriptions. In Q4, we added approximately 132,000 net new paid subscriptions. Using an ASP of $750, this achievement in subscriptions effectively transitions approximately $99 million of perpetual revenue to Creative Cloud in Q4. After backing out recognized Q4 subscription revenue of $20 million, we would have achieved approximately $79 million more of revenue in Q4.","We also began to ratably recognize some enterprise agreements, which additionally transitioned approximately $19 million of Q4 perpetual revenue. With these adjustments, we believe Q4 revenue would have been approximately $1.251 billion.","We experienced stable demand across our major geographies.","From a currency perspective, quarter-over-quarter FX rate changes had a $6.7 million positive impact on reported revenue. Hedging gains contributed $2 million to revenue in Q4 FY '12 versus $7.7 million in Q3 FY '12. Thus, the net sequential quarterly currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $1 million. Year-over-year, FX rate changes had a $13.7 million negative impact on reported revenue. Comparing the $2 million in Q4 FY '12 hedging gains to the $3.6 million of hedging gains in Q4 FY '11, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $15.3 million.","Employees at the end of Q4 totaled 11,144 versus 10,811 at the end of last quarter. The sequential increase was driven primarily by hiring in our field organization.","Our ending deferred revenue balance increased by $59.3 million to a record $619.6 million. As a reminder, Creative Cloud subscriptions are billed monthly and are not reflected in deferred revenue on the balance sheet. Our trade DSO was 49 days, which compares to 50 days in the year-ago quarter and 48 days last quarter.","During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $473.7 million. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $3.54 billion compared to $3.25 billion at the end of Q3. More than 80% of our cash is offshore.","In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a total cost of $67 million. For the year, we repurchased approximately 11.5 million shares at a total cost of $372 million.","I will now discuss business segment results. Our Digital Marketing segment is made up of 2 components. The first is revenue from our Adobe Marketing Cloud, which we previously referred to as Digital Marketing Suite. During the quarter, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $220.4 million. This represents Q4 year-over-year growth of 32%.","Adobe Marketing Cloud analytics transactions in the quarter were 1.74 trillion, up 17% year-over-year. Mobile device use continues to be a driver in our analytics business. Mobile transactions increased to 22%, up from 18% last quarter. On Cyber Monday, we achieved a single-day traffic record with 19 billion server transactions, up from the previous record of 17.5 billion last year.","The second component of our Digital Marketing segment is revenue from the LiveCycle and Connect businesses. LiveCycle and Connect contributed $70 million in Q4 revenue, down as expected from the $102.7 million we achieved in Q4 of FY '11.","In our Digital Media segment, we achieved revenue of $810.7 million. The 2 major components of revenue are our Creative family of products and our Document Services products.","In Document Services, the new Acrobat release achieved strong enterprise adoption. That, plus continued growth in EchoSign, our electronic contract solution, and Acrobat cloud services, drove record revenue in Q4 of $210.2 million. Similar to the Creative business, we are driving subscriptions growth and a shift to enterprise term-based licenses. As a result, we exited the year with approximately $50 million in annualized recurring revenue in Document Services.","I'd now like to discuss our Creative Cloud business. Our strategy is to provide differentiated offerings to our Creative Cloud customers. During fiscal 2012, our subscription results were primarily driven by adoption of Creative Cloud for individuals. Towards the end of Q4, we had a limited release of Creative Cloud for teams, which became widely available this week.","In 2013, we will be offering Creative Cloud to enterprise customers. In anticipation of transitioning enterprise customers to Creative Cloud, during Q4, we began moving them to enterprise term license agreements or ETLAs. Like Creative Cloud subscriptions, ETLAs are term-based, give customers access to ongoing technology updates, and will enable a smoother migration to the enterprise offering when it becomes available.","Earlier this year, we introduced several metrics to help you understand our progress with Creative Cloud adoption. They included total number of subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue or ARR. ARR is calculated by multiplying the number of current paid subscriptions by the average monthly revenue per user per month, multiplied by 12. We also provided a methodology to correlate the value of our new subscribers to revenue we would have recognized if those customers had licensed perpetual software, assuming a transaction value based on product mix.","As our enterprise customers migrate to ETLAs, some of these contracts involve estimated numbers of licenses rather than precise registered user information. As such, we have decided we should exclude enterprise-based subscriptions from our Creative Cloud subscription count. However, because revenue from ETLAs is recognized ratably, we will include the annual contract value of ETLAs in our Creative ARR calculations.","Now I would like to review our recent Creative Cloud results. During the fourth quarter, we continued to accelerate the adoption of Creative Cloud subscriptions. We added approximately 132,000 net new individual and team subscriptions during the quarter. To reiterate, these do not include enterprise users who are covered under ETLA agreements.","In Q4, we averaged 10,000 new subscriptions per week, up from 8,000 per week in Q3. Exiting Q4, 90% of subscribers are on an annual subscription versus month-to-month, and 81% of subscribers are subscribed to the full Creative Cloud versus point-product subscriptions.","We exited Q4 with Creative ARR of $153 million, up from $90 million of ARR exiting Q3. $146 million of ARR was from Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions. The remaining $7 million was from the annual contract value of Creative ETLAs signed in Q4.","Adobe.com is increasingly becoming the preferred way for our customers to engage with us. 28% of all Creative subscriptions and perpetual units were licensed via Adobe.com in FY '12, up from 18% last year.","With Creative Cloud for individuals and teams now available and with our sales team migrating enterprise customers to ETLAs, we are in a position to utilize all our routes to market to help accelerate customer migration to Creative Cloud. At our last analyst meeting, we reported that total Creative product units have been at approximately 3 million units per year for each of the past 4 years. We disclosed our goal to increase total perpetual and subscription units by 10% this year. I'm pleased to report that we grew Creative units 13% in FY '12.","Now let's look at Q1 and FY '13. For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we are targeting a revenue range of $950 million to $1 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to exit Q1 with approximately $215 million of Creative ARR, up from $153 million in Q4. The estimated Q1 Creative ARR is based on adding slightly fewer new Creative Cloud paid subscriptions than what we achieved in Q4 due to normal Q4 to Q1 seasonality.","In Document Services, we expect to exit Q1 with approximately $60 million of Document Services ARR, up from $50 million in Q4. Adding Creative ARR to Document Services ARR yields a total Digital Media ARR exiting Q1 of approximately $275 million.","Assuming the midpoint of our targeted revenue range, we expect Digital Media reported revenue to be down sequentially due to continued migration to Creative Cloud subscription and ETLAs, as well as normal Q1 seasonality. In our Digital Marketing segment, we expect Adobe Marketing Cloud Q1 revenue to be relatively flat with Q4 revenue, coupled with a sequential decline in our LiveCycle and Connect businesses. We expect Print and Publishing to also be flat quarter-over-quarter.","In addition, we are targeting Q1 share count to be 503 million to 505 million shares. We are targeting nonoperating expense to be between $19 million and $21 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 GAAP tax rate of 28% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 22.5%. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.08 to $0.14 per share, and a Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.26 to $0.32.","Now I would like to discuss fiscal 2013. We expect to exit FY '13 with over 1.25 million paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions. We expect the impact of these subscriptions and continued adoption of ETLAs to effectively transition approximately $690 million of reported perpetual revenue to subscriptions next year and to exit the year with a total ARR of approximately $685 million.","In Document Services, in order to drive consistency in how we sell to enterprise customers, we have begun to migrate many of our large Acrobat customers to ETLAs. As a result, we expect Document Services reported revenue to be approximately $750 million in FY '13, with an additional $80 million of perpetual revenue transitioned to ETLAs that will be ratably recognized. Together, this results in a targeted growth rate in Document Services of 5% to 7%.","Combining Acrobat ETLAs and cloud-based services, we expect to exit FY '13 with $115 million of Document Services ARR. FY '13 will be the pivotal year in our transition to a subscription model, and we expect to exit the year with approximately $800 million of Digital Media ARR.","As the leader in the Digital Marketing segment, we will continue to invest in this explosive growth category. By focusing on the 5 solution areas in the Adobe Marketing Cloud, we expect to grow bookings by over 25%, yielding reported revenue growth of over 20%. In just a few years, we will have built a brand new billion-dollar business for Adobe. We expect LiveCycle and Connect to continue to decline, but to contribute an estimated $200 million of revenue during FY '13. We expect Print and Publishing to be flat year-over-year.","We expect total Adobe reported revenue in FY '13 to be approximately $4.1 billion. We will closely manage expenses during this upcoming transition year, and expect earnings per share to be approximately $0.62 on a GAAP basis and $1.40 on a non-GAAP basis. Keep in mind, the $770 million of revenue effectively transitioned from perpetual to subscription and ETLAs equates to approximately $1.20 of non-GAAP EPS.","At our analyst meeting last November, we said we would redefine the creative process and deliver an amazing set of products and services for our customers, available via a new subscription model. In FY '12, we overachieved our goals by growing total Creative units by 13%. We exited the year with 326,000 paid subscriptions and over 1 million free members.","At the analyst meeting, we said the transition to a cloud model would be complete within 4 years. Based on our success in FY '12 and our plans for FY '13, we anticipate we will compete the bulk of the transition sooner than that, with approximately 4 million individual and team Creative Cloud paid subscriptions by the end of 2015. After FY '13, we believe reported revenue from our Creative Cloud and CS product family will achieve a CAGR of over 15% from FY '14 through FY '16.","We said by the end of 2014, we would build a billion-dollar business in Digital Marketing. With the success we've achieved in FY '12, we're on pace to achieve a billion-dollar run rate by the end of 2013, growing 25% in bookings and 20% in revenue.","We said that by the end of 2014, 40% of Adobe's overall revenue would be recurring. We're on track to achieve this goal exiting the end of 2013.","While FY '13 is a transition year, we are confident that our strategy and our execution show that the company is better positioned than it has ever been. We are committed to providing continued transparency to demonstrate progress as we reinvent the company.","I'd now like to turn the call back over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mark. These are exciting times at Adobe. Last year, we outlined a strategy to reinvent the company and accelerate growth by focusing on the Digital Media and Digital Marketing categories. I'm pleased to report we are ahead of schedule in our transformation.","We continue to be the undisputed leader in Digital Media and in just 7 months since the launch of Creative Cloud, we have over 326,000 paid subscriptions and $153 million of annualized recurring revenue. We are a leader in Digital Marketing, with the most comprehensive offering and the inside track with the marketing community. This business, which didn't exist at Adobe 3 years ago, is on pace to reach $1 billion in annual revenue.","As we close the year, we see huge opportunity for Adobe ahead. The dramatic shift we are making in our business is really not different than what we've done for the past 30 years. Innovation is in our blood. It defines us and galvanizes our employees. We look forward to 2013.","Thank you for joining us today. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, Shantanu. Before we begin Q&A, I have a few logistics items to go over. First, for those investors and financial analysts who want to stay current on the latest Adobe news, we encourage you to follow Adobe on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, and to frequently check Adobe's corporate blogs on blogs.adobe.com. We are increasingly using blogs and social channels as a primary means to communicate important information.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A question I had around the Creative Cloud move. It does seem like customers are enduring somewhat of a price increase as they move to these new offerings. And I'm wondering if you could talk about where customers are seeing the additional value that's driving them to move. How much of it is sort of a carat that you're offering in terms of value versus a stick in terms of practices you may be using, especially around enterprise licensing to encourage the change?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Walter, let me start off with that. And with respect to the transparency, as I think both Mark and I have said right through, we want to make sure that we provide you with the information while we go through this transition. As it relates to the cloud, I think people are really seeing the benefits of always having access to the applications and the latest applications. As I mentioned, we've actually given 3 updates already. We've introduced new services like sync and share and we've really just started, I mean, in terms of the innovation. So I think it's just a better way to stay current. I think people see the promise of having their assets in a place which they can get location independent. And so there really are no sticks, so to speak, right now. It's all about seeing that the future of creation is being delivered through the Creative Cloud.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then Mark, just I didn't hear you talk about -- you gave a lot of detail on fiscal '13. I didn't hear you talk about cash flow. I know there is probably also some cash flow impact to you based on the fact that most of these are monthly billed. But maybe you could help us understand sort of where we should be thinking about cash flow for fiscal '13?","Mark Garrett","Yes, so the great news is we have a terrific cash balance. I talked about that. From a cash flow perspective, Walter, it is going to model, as it has, somewhat closely with non-GAAP net income. So you should expect the cash flow will be less as we go through this pivotal year in 2013 than it has been in, say, 2012.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Peter Goldmacher with Cowen.","Peter L. Goldmacher - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I just want to ask you a quick question. It was interesting to hear your reconciliation from a shrink wrap to subscriptions and on the revenue, I think, you gave us. How do you guys think about drawing in new users that maybe had been priced out of the products because of the upfront costs were so high and new users you're getting because of a more affordable price point?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Peter, I mean we certainly are seeing new customer adoption. I think we referred to that statistic last time in terms of the number of new users because it is more affordable. And I think we've heard that over 30% at times would not have subscribed or would not have gone through the perpetual version but are finding that the Creative Cloud is the best option to go. I think, actually, there's again a lot of headroom ahead of us as we start to combat piracy as well and start to get those customers as part of the Creative Cloud. So at this point, we're clearly attracting new customers. I think Mark referred to the fact that for the first time in many years, we've actually grown units for the Creative business, which is exciting to see, and it just again speaks to the innovation that the teams are providing. Maybe to add to Walter's question as well, we do have information on all of the apps that are being downloaded, and the new HTML applications that were created are seeing quite a bit of downloads. We're certainly seeing the flagship products of Flash Pro, Photoshop and Illustrator and InDesign. But the new products that we're delivering as part of the Creative Cloud, whether it's Lightroom or whether it's Edge and Muse, are also seeing fairly significant adoption, which I think bodes well for us.","Peter L. Goldmacher - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on that. So when you're selling these new products and some of these new products are integrated with the Digital Marketing cloud, I know it's early days, but how helpful is it to you to leverage that Creative brand when you're selling the Digital Marketing products? Are we early in that part of the sales cycle? Or do your marketing -- Digital Marketing customers already have a positive view of Adobe and that's a catalyst to sell that Digital Marketing stuff?","Shantanu Narayen","I think it's a great question, Peter, and there's no question that we are seeing quite a bit of synergy between the Creative Cloud and the marketing cloud. And the 2 places where we see that a lot is in the web experience part of Digital Marketing. That business continues to be on fire as people re-platform their online businesses. And the second area where we see that is if you have a Chief Revenue Officer who's thinking about Digital Publishing Suite. Traditionally it was just magazines that were buying Digital Publishing Suite, now you're seeing insurance companies, financial services, retail and travel all seeing it. So I think Mark and his organization are really able to go in and paint a picture of the entire content life cycle. And it's clearly working. It's also working for us in the reverse way, which is if you have our content management solution, you want to make sure that you have the latest version of the Creative products so that it can automatically put data. And as I said, we'll be also releasing digital asset management that ties them together.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Adam Holt with Morgan Stanley.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. The first is it looks like you all had nice unit growth for the year. I was hoping maybe you could break down, was that all on the Creative Cloud side? And maybe if you can, add any color about what you think you added in terms of net new users in the quarter and\/or year, net new user to the Adobe family?","Shantanu Narayen","So Adam, overall units, we do know that we added approximately 13% new units in 2012. And I think it's actually being across the board. I mean, commercial units did really quite well. We continue to see adoption of both, what you would call the perpetual version, as well as a clearly, the subscribers were materially ahead of where we thought we would be in the first 6 or 7 months. And we will continuously update what we are seeing in terms of new users, but we're certainly attracting new users to the platform.","Adam H. Holt - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And if I could just ask a follow-up on the subs guidance for next year. It looks like it implies a little bit of an acceleration in your subs adds. You've got new products in the market. Maybe walk us through the different variables you're thinking about that gets you comfortable with an acceleration on the subs side?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure Adam, and I think it comes from the initial success that we have seen on subscriptions has been predominantly on the individual side. The team we had a product released to our partners really late in the quarter. And so when you look at the Q4 subs number, that's all individual and we'll certainly be extending that through the team offering that's coming out -- that has come out, it's now shipping. And so that significantly enhances the number of people we can target. Similarly, geographic expansion, I think as we go through 2013, you're going to see geographic expansion in terms of the subscriptions. And frankly, I think we expect that as the innovation is increasingly cloud-based, that more and more customers are going to be doing it. We're going to have community, we're going to have training and the viral impact of people looking at it and understanding that the latest version is on the cloud we do believe will drive it. Last, we also have a funnel. I think we talked about the fact that we have over 1 million free members, and it's certainly our goal to convert them. Trials have always been the #1 way in which we have converted customers, and we believe that that's a good opportunity to go and be a world-class consumer marketing company and convert that.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'd like to ask about the enterprise term license agreements you\u2019ve begun to introduce and why they're a necessary or required interim step to moving people to the cloud? Is it just simply because the enterprise version isn't out now? It will be out in a little while when you simply wanted to start the transition now. So a little bit of color on that. And then my second question has to do with the education market. Have you started to tap that? Do we see any activity in the fourth quarter? And is there a game plan, if we didn't, to tap into that next year?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Steve. So on the first question as it relates to the enterprise, it clearly is in line with our strategy to have the Creative offerings be -- rather than perpetual offerings, be term offerings. So as we are signing these enterprise-wide agreements, I think it makes a lot more sense for us to have those mid-term license agreements. It's very aligned with the subscription model. And so in Q4, we started to move to that. I think it's in our best interest. I think it's also in customers' best interest because by definition then that they have access to all of the latest upgrades as they become available. We will deliver enhanced functionality to enterprises as well in 2013, and that will be much better integration between our desktop products and what our marketing cloud provides. So certainly, there'll be more functionality. But moving to ETLAs was very much in line with strategically where we want to go. In terms of education, we did see a fair number of education subscribers. I think people are starting to adopt the Creative Cloud in education, and we saw a very healthy number of subscribers in Q4.","Mark Garrett","The other thing I'd add, Steve, and this was maybe inherent in what Shantanu said is that ETLAs, from a customer's perspective, they're buying and paying for the software in a similar way to the way they will under a subscription model, so it gets them kind of more adapt to paying us on a regular basis as instead of all upfront.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein.","Mark L. Moerdler - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Two questions. Just a quick clarification. You said that there were 3 million Creative units over the last couple of years and you've seen growth. Is that 3 million that were sold during, or total of 3 million in there? The second part of it is we've seen the EPS guide is low. Obviously, and a good chunk of that is due to the move to subscription. Is there some other part of that from the line items we should be considering that might be additional costs or expenses we should be modeling in?","Mark Garrett","Mark, this is Mark. So the 3 million is 3 million units per year that we were shipping of Creative product, and it's been relatively stable at 3 million for the past many years. And this year, we saw a 13% uplift to that unit count. On the financial model and you can go into this in detail but a very high level, yes, the primary move in earnings was driven by the transition of revenue from perpetual to subscription and to ETLAs, both together. That was worth $1.20, as I said in the script in 2013 earnings. And if you believe that there's more there that we could have driven from an earnings perspective, yes, there's a portion of that, that's cost. It's not too terribly different than where our run rate is from a cost perspective, however. So if you look at expenses, they ramped during the year and then you've got obviously the full effect of that cost going into the next year. And the other thing I'd say is that we do think it's very important to continue to invest in the business, particularly around the Digital Marketing space where it's a very hot market. We're the leader in the space, and we want to keep that 25% bookings growth and 20% revenue growth going.","Operator","Next, we have Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The first question I had was to do with the fact that this year, I think you had offered folks that really were on versions older the opportunity to still get upgrade pricing through the end of the calendar year. And I'm just curious as to whether there was any way you can look at the units that you sold this year and get a sense for whether you've had a better success in converting, if you will, older version users to the new product that are on Creative Cloud or just on the perpetual?","Shantanu Narayen","Ross, I think I would say that across-the-board, the Creative Cloud we've seen interest from new users, from users of the latest version and clearly allowing people on prior versions to upgrade to the cloud, we've also seen uplift on that. As I said earlier, the number of subscribers that we saw in the first few months was significantly higher than the one that we expect. Moving forward, the good news about having them all in our customer databases is that we will be in a position to get a lot more information on what they are using to improve their customer sat which, by the way, I should say we track customer satisfaction quite a bit. And we've seen that the satisfaction of people online as part of the Creative Cloud is quite a bit higher than perpetual, so I think that bodes well for us as well.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe just one quick one on ASP. I know, Mark, you didn't call out ASP. I think you've got a branded ARR now. But is there any color you could provide around the ASP on the Creative Cloud subscriptions? And also, what's your current thinking with regard to how you'll deal with the promotional pricing as we start to come up against the anniversary?","Mark Garrett","Yes. So we are, Ross, more focused on the ARR number. But the average revenue per user on the individual side has been very stable. It's very consistent with what it was last quarter. On the promotional pricing, it's our expectation that those people will stay with us and start paying the higher price. That's been tested in many other businesses, and we expect that it is a very sticky product and that those people will continue to subscribe at the higher price.","Operator","Our next question is from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Mark, just on the margin side. I think you're assuming somewhere in the mid-20s, if we did the math right, on your operating margins for this next year. From your perspective over the long haul, do you believe this transition will yield a more profitable Adobe relative to where you saw the margins? Or you'd expect a similar operating margin target as we go through this when we exit?","Mark Garrett","So yes, Brent, you're right. This is the pivotal year, as we said, and it's very consistent with what we would expect from a transitional perspective. From here onward, from 2013 onward, revenue, margin and EPS are all going to grow, and we have tried to give you guys some transparency around longer-term growth rates for some of the revenue streams. We talked about 4 million Creative Cloud subscribers in 2015. We talked about Creative Cloud and the CS product group growing 15% on a CAGR from 14% to 16%. We talked about the marketing cloud growth continuing at 20%. And I would expect that EPS, through all that, starts to grow again, at least as fast as revenue. So we get through this year, and all those metrics get better and better from '13 onward.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So do you believe over time then it can be as profitable as the old model?","Mark Garrett","Well to be honest with you, as the Digital Marketing business grows, that's an inherently lower-margin business, right? That's a complete SaaS-oriented business. It's just not ever going to be at Digital Media-type margin. So as that gets bigger and bigger, it does weigh on margins. I think we can do some things to pull more margin out of some of the businesses that we have and we're very good at that. But again, we're going to be very focused on driving EPS growth and driving that EPS growth with revenue growth, even if it means doing so at a lower margin than where we've been.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Just one last point. At the Analyst Day, you did say through the transition, you thought operating margins, you could hold the margins up and obviously, you're crossing a point where you can go after this, given the success that you've seen. And I would assume that this success now has fueled this increase in spending beyond kind of what you had initially mentioned at the Analyst Day?","Mark Garrett","It's not the spending, Brent. It's that we're moving faster on the transition, right? We are so happy with the way this is going that we want to get through this in 2013. We want to be completely transitioned when we get through 2013 from a financial model perspective. And that is clearly more optimistic than what we thought at Analyst Day.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Brad Zelnick with Macquarie.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","Great to see you finish the year on a high note and especially the overachievement of your unit growth, which brings me to my question. Mark, what's your assumption for Creative unit growth embedded in your guidance for subscribers and revenue in 2013? And what unit growth will you have achieved in 2014 and 2015 if you exit with 4 million Creative Cloud subs? And just to ask another one because I get this question asked all the time, what does the decay rate [ph] look like on the perpetual side? What's your assumption there?","Mark Garrett","Sorry, the what rate? You mean the churn rate?","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","No, on the perpetual side [indiscernible].","Mark Garrett","I see. Yes, I see. Well, so Brad, we've said for a while, and we still believe this, that we think we can drive 10% more unit growth. If you look at the 4 million, right, the 4 million is significantly above the 3 million that we said we've been shipping per year for the past several years. So when you get out to 2015 with 4 million units, that's quite a jump up from the 3 million that we've seen in the past. I think that's the -- at a high level, that's the best way to look at it.","Shantanu Narayen","The other thing I would say, Brad, is that relative to what we had talked about at the analyst meeting, we certainly believe that subscriptions are going to grow faster. It's going to come with unit growth. But also, what you consider perpetual, we do believe that that's going to transition as well faster.","Brad A. Zelnick - Macquarie Research","And just a follow-up to something else you said earlier. You said all that 30% of new Creative units have been due to franchise. Can you define that and determine that? And what is the trend then for Q3 to Q4? And what assumptions you based, you used in your guidance for next year and beyond?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Brad. So that, I was reiterating some of the statistics that we had said at the end of Q3. We do periodic surveys, we certainly understand that we're attracting new customers, and we'll give you more insight. But net-net, it's clear to us that we're driving new users, we're driving faster subscription than we had originally expected and we certainly, as we have been with all the numbers, continue to update that as we do our surveys.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of operational questions first. Shantanu, how do you anticipate investing in external sales and distribution capacity this year and through the rest of the transition? And internally, would it be fair to say that by the time you get to 2015 and complete the transition, that the Adobe.com could be roughly $1 billion business for you, well up from the $0.5 billion or so that it's typically you've been doing, and a couple of follow-ups.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So Jay, if the question was around sales and distribution capacity only for the Digital Media business, we certainly are seeing more on Adobe.com. You're right, if we have the subscriber growth that we've talked about, Adobe.com will be in the billion-dollar range. I just want to reiterate that we will continue to invest in sales capacity for the Digital Marketing business. The other thing I will highlight is that even as it relates to Digital Media and subscriptions, we do expect to continue to sign a lot of online partners who will be able to drive traffic and, hence, subscribers to Adobe. And we continue to think that, that's a great way to attract customers. There's no reason why e-tail stores as well as other online services will not be a source of customers to Adobe moving forward.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Mark, with respect to the revenue shift, so far, the majority of the customers signing up, I think, has been from existing customers within the installed base who therefore might otherwise have been eligible to upgrade. So, so much similar to an earlier question, how do you think about the decay of your upgrades business, which has also been roughly, I think, over $0.5 billion a year. Do you think that decays significantly as well as the eligible existing customers move to cloud?","Mark Garrett","Yes, I think the short answer is I do. I think as the cloud gets more and more adoption and as people have that viral aspect towards the cloud, both sides of perpetual full and upgrade are going to come down. And that's baked into these assumptions on subscribers, on long-term adoption and units as well.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, a product question for Shantanu. You mentioned in your remarks digital asset management. I assume you're referring to the Day CQ product line. So with respect to that, are you going to be quickly transitioning that to a ratable model, which historically hasn't been? And could you talk about how Day might become more integrated with other Adobe products and technologies to make it a broader or more functional platform in its own right?","Shantanu Narayen","Sure. So first as it relates to the Day business, which is now part of the marketing, Adobe Marketing Cloud as part of the web experience management solution, that business has been doubling. It has been really a phenomenal success for us, Jay. We both offer Day on premise so that people can have their websites behind the firewall. We've also started to offer it as managed services where we will run that website for them and we offer that as a hosted. And so I think we have the most comprehensive offering right now for online web asset management. In terms of the digital asset management, that's a component that we will deliver over and above the core web experience management solution. So we think that's actually additive to revenue and helps tie the Creative Cloud and the marketing cloud together, and that's going to be -- we're already testing it out with some customers, and it's going to be out imminently.","Operator","Next, we have Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions. And I think there's been kind of some talk about this, but I was wondering if you could get maybe a little bit more granular. You gave us your view about the fiscal '14 to fiscal '16 kind of 15% revenue CAGR in your prepared remarks. I'm wondering if you could kind of walk us through the 1 or 2 key drivers behind those. And then also, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out how should we be thinking about the fiscal '14 impact of subscription on the top line. I know you said things are going to grow from there in terms of revenue, margins and EPS, but kind of will there still be this transition period going on? And how should we think about the high-level impact on '14? And then I just had a follow-up.","Mark Garrett","Sure, Heather, it's Mark, I'll start out. So the big impact when you get out to '14, '15 and '16 from a revenue point of view and the reason you get that 15-plus percent CAGR is primarily 2 things. One is we're driving new units. You're shipping in essence 4 million units a year instead of 3 million units a year. And the other is you get this very nice stacking effect of the subscription model. I mean, it's the beauty of the subscription model. Obviously, people are paying you every month, month after month, nobody is skipping releases, and that stacking effect plus the new units drive a very healthy growth rate in that business. On the...","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Fiscal '14...","Mark Garrett","Yes, on the kind of path from here forward, revenue grows, so we will not see a dip in revenue after fiscal '13. You do get...","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. So to get to that CAGR, I'm just wondering how -- what does the slope of the line look like?","Mark Garrett","Well I can't do that for you frankly, Heather. But you can do the modeling at a high level based on some of the metrics we gave you, and that's why we wanted to make sure you have the 4 million subscribers in 2015. But everything does grow from here, so you won't see a revenue dip in Creative or in total Adobe from here out.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And then, Mark, I guess the follow-up would be could you walk us through what type of churn rates we should be thinking about in our model from the subscription business?","Mark Garrett","So it hasn't been...","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","What are you guys using in your assumptions?","Mark Garrett","Yes, I mean right now, we've been at 80% retention rates in terms of modeling, which we think is conservative. We haven't seen churn yet for the annual people. So the big data point will come when the annual people have to renew. But we've assumed in the modeling, 80% retention.","Operator","Next, we have Blair Abernethy with Stifel.","Blair H. Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just want to, Mark, if you could drill in a little bit more into the Acrobat business and just give us a sense there in terms of the historically when it was really just a shrink wrap business, how much of that business would be under enterprise site licenses? I'm just kind of looking for a shape of the magnitude of that, that's going to transition to term.","Shantanu Narayen","Blair, let me take that question. I think the Acrobat business has been pretty broad-based. The enterprise license agreements are actually a smaller part of the entire business. But the important thing for us in that was to make sure that we offer both the Creative products as well as the Acrobat products in one enterprise term license. As I think about modeling that business, I think for 2013, we've said you can model that at about a 5% to 7% growth. And that revenue, I think, we broke up how much would be in perpetual and how much would be going to ARR. And I would model that as growing in revenue after 2013 at that 5% to 7% and growing in ARR higher than that.","Blair H. Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And on the subscriptions on the Creative side, what sort of been the experience in the last 6 months here from sort of a geographic or regional strength?","Shantanu Narayen","I think as it relates to subscriptions, it's primarily, at this point, U.S. and some countries in Europe. And it's sort of actually mirrors what you might think of as our traditional strength. That's one of the reasons why I said as we roll out the offering in other geographies, there's certainly opportunity. But you can assume that at this point, it's primarily the big markets for Adobe, which tends to be the U.S., U.K., Germany, Japan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Breza with RBC Capital Markets.","Robert P. Breza - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Mark, as I've looked at the 3 million units going to 4 million units in 2015 and think about what you said from a churn perspective but the renewal rates being high, not a lot of alternatives for people to switch after they get on the Creative Cloud. And historically, you guys have been at 40% margin kind of business or at least you had peaked out over 40% margins. What prohibits you from getting back to that level given this transition going forward?","Mark Garrett","It really comes down to Digital Marketing. It really comes down to how big Digital Marketing becomes as a percent of the total company. And I think you could look at any SaaS company in the world and see that you're just not going to get to 40% operating margins in those businesses. So it becomes a mixed question. Believe me, I think you've seen over the past 5-plus, 10-plus years that we're very focused on the cost side of the business. We pay very close attention to it. We will manage it very effectively. But I'm leery to say that we're going to go back to 40% operating margins primarily due to the mix. And again, we're going to be very focused on driving earnings per share, at least as fast as revenue.","Operator","Next, we have the line of Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.","Jason Maynard - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mark, the one thing that I -- maybe have missed it earlier on, was on the cash flow question. Was -- when you think about the amount of revenue that's getting deferred, what would be helpful is what's the rate, if you will, of cash flow capture, if you will? Are you thinking about a net revenue? So if it's a $700 million deferral, should we think about roughly the Creative Cloud suite annual ARR versus the perpetual license and maybe look at that and sort of say, \"Okay, that will get captured over X type of time frame.\" What's your best guess, if you will, for us to think about that, that type of modeling?","Mark Garrett","I mean again, the challenge is that -- it's not a challenge, the way the business model works is that we're billing people monthly, so we're collecting that cash monthly. Even the annual people are getting charged on their credit card monthly, so that revenue that used to come in upfront is getting spread out over, say 2 years, if you think about they're paying roughly $480 per year. That now gets spread out over a couple of years to get back to that $780-plus that we used to get upfront. So I don't know if that helps answer your question. I think going forward, I'll look at cash flow and provide more details about kind of go-forward cash flow. I'm just frankly not prepared to do that today.","Shantanu Narayen","I just want to again reiterate, thank you for joining us on the call today. And there's no question in our mind that as a company, we're in significantly better shape entering 2013 than we were entering 2012. I think we had a very successful introduction of Creative Cloud. We're attracting new customers. We're creating a strong funnel for conversion, and I think we've transitioned the company to a more rapid development methodology that helps us innovate faster for our customers.","I think we are broadening the customer base that we can target with Creative Cloud with the introduction of the team product, and we will extend that even further with Creative Cloud for enterprises in 2013. We're starting to transition our enterprise customers to the ETLAs, and there's no question that we're seeing synergy with the Adobe Marketing Cloud, both in the web experience management area as well as in the Digital Publishing Suite. And I think you've also seen that in Document Services, with mobile driving more PDF usage, we're actually building a really nice annuity with our Document Services. And I think you'll see that the ARR shows the health of the business that we expect to exit in 2013.","And on Digital Marketing, the business is doing well, both revenue and bookings. And it's clear that it's an explosive market category where Adobe is very well positioned. I'm actually quite pleased with the introduction of the Adobe Marketing Cloud and the solution focus that we're going to take with content management, analytics, targeting, media optimization. And social had a really good quarter as well in Q4.","And so as we think about entering 2013, it's with driving innovation, serving customers and having a really energized employee base.

Q3 was a record quarter for Adobe, with strong revenue and continued growth across our entire business. We delivered $2.83 billion in revenue in Q3, representing 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share for the quarter was $1.61, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.05. Adobe\u2019s strategy to empower people to create and transform how businesses compete is fueling our continued success. The ability to deliver a personalized relationship with every customer using digital technology is a mandate for every business.","Internal efficiency, including a paper-to-digital revolution, is critical to achieving that imperative. In addition, design and creativity has never been more relevant. Everyone has a story to tell from professional photographers, to immersive content and experience designers, to students and small business owners, and they need to tell it on an ever-increasing number of canvases. Adobe is innovating to expand these market opportunities, and customers around the globe continue to count on Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud to run their businesses, transform how they work, and bring their creative ideas to life.","In our Digital Media business, we drove strong revenue growth in both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud in Q3. Net new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR was $386 million, and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q3 grew to $7.86 billion. Q3 Creative revenue was $1.65 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. Creative Cloud is the creativity platform for all. Through a relentless focus on innovation across different media types, devices, and segments, Creative Cloud has become the one-stop shop for creative applications and services as well as the leading source for creative inspiration, learning, training and community.","Our goal is to ensure that Creative Cloud applications and services make every creative possibility a reality for every one of our customers. Adobe\u2019s vision is that mobile devices and tablets should be used for creation in addition to consumption. Adobe Lightroom, our complete system for photo editing, achieved significant growth on mobile devices with Q3 monthly active users growing 130% year-over-year. In Q3, new Adobe IDs created from Adobe mobile apps rose more than 40% year-over-year, showing that mobile continues to be a healthy on-ramp for subscriptions. In Q3 we announced Adobe Fresco, a groundbreaking drawing and painting app, which will be available first on iPad later this fall. Fresco digitally reimagines the process that artists have traditionally used, whether it\u2019s chalk, pastels, oil, or watercolor paint. Like Photoshop transformed and democratized photography, we believe Fresco will change how artists use digital to draw and illustrate. Apple will feature Fresco in hundreds of its retail stores as part of its iPad Pro Big Draw campaign.","At Adobe, we believe that creative skills should be a core part of school curricula and that STEAM, not just STEM, should be a focus in education. We\u2019ve expanded our Adobe Ambassador Network to target more than 100 colleges across the country, where students evangelize creativity and lead on-campus workshops to help fellow students learn to use Adobe creative products. Last week, we launched a new program with Reddit to encourage young creators to contribute their personal designs to a giant, global canvas on the Reddit front page. This was the biggest community event on Reddit based on total contributions and participation. ","These types of partnerships give us an opportunity to introduce Creative Cloud to millions of next-generation creators. Adobe MAX is the world\u2019s largest creativity conference. In November, we\u2019ll welcome our global creative community and partners, more than 15,000 live attendees and nearly one million virtual attendees and unveil significant new Adobe Creative Cloud innovation. With Document Cloud, we are accelerating the transformation of paper-to-digital processes and reinventing how people scan, edit, collaborate, sign and share digital documents. Q3 Document Cloud revenue and net new ARR were records for a quarter, and we grew total Document Cloud ARR to $993 million.","Key Document Cloud customer wins in Q3 included Deutsche Bank, Saudi Aramco, Dell and the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs. As with our creative products, our Document Cloud customers increasingly expect business processes to be seamless across desktop and mobile devices. In Q3 more than 2.5 billion PDFs were opened in Adobe Reader on mobile devices. Adobe Scan, which has become the top document scanning app for both iOS and Android, has close to 35 million installs, with downloads increasing more than 30% year-over-year in Q3.","Strong uptake of our Document Cloud mobile applications, as well as continued strength in Acrobat subscription adoption, is driving momentum in the business. In addition, we launched new web-based services that offer instant access to Adobe PDF creation and compression capabilities from any browser. We believe these services are not only relevant to individuals looking to quickly get work done, but also developers who need to build best-in-class PDF document support into their web applications. We are investing in creative marketing campaigns to drive awareness of these capabilities and target new users. Adobe Sign, our leading cloud-based electronic signature solution, continues to gain traction among businesses and organizations. This quarter we introduced Adobe Sign for Small Business, providing small and mid-market businesses enterprise-level e-signature capabilities. ","In our Digital Experience business, we achieved Experience Cloud revenue of $821 million for the quarter, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. Our vision is to help every business become an Experience Business. This means enabling them to deliver engaging experiences that anticipate and meet the needs of their customers at every stage of their journey from acquisition to purchase and renewal. We believe Customer Experience Management is a significant growth opportunity for Adobe. Experience Cloud is the industry\u2019s most comprehensive offering, providing content and commerce, customer journey management, and customer data and insights to power experience-driven businesses across all industries. In Q3, Experience Cloud was named a Leader in seven Gartner Magic Quadrant and Forrester Wave reports. Key Experience Cloud wins in Q3 included Delta Airlines, T-Mobile, Capital One, and Best Western.","We are the undisputed leader in this large and growing market, and we continue to expand the opportunity in front of us, extending our footprint from B2C to B2B, from enterprise to mid-market, and from the CMO to the CIO, CTO, and CEO. Content and commerce are the foundation for every digital business. We continue to drive strong performance with Adobe Experience Manager for multi-channel experience delivery. Through integration with Magento Commerce, we are making every experience shoppable. This has led to strong performance of our integrated content and commerce offering, and Magento Commerce bookings growth of more than 40% year-over-year in Q3. Multi-channel campaign management is another differentiated pillar of the Adobe Experience Cloud. The integration of Marketo with Adobe Campaign gives Adobe the industry\u2019s strongest offering in the customer journey management and orchestration space across both B2B and B2C. ","Earlier this year we introduced Adobe Experience Platform, the industry\u2019s first real-time platform for Customer Experience Management. Adobe Experience Platform will solve a critical challenge every enterprise is facing, how to harness massive amounts of valuable customer data that is siloed and not easily accessible or actionable. Adobe Experience Platform stitches together data from across the enterprise creating real-time unified customer profiles, enabling the activation and delivery of hyper-personalized experiences. By combining Adobe Experience Platform with Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager and our new real-time Customer Data Platform, or CDP, we are creating a new, comprehensive customer data and insights offering for the digital enterprise that is unmatched.","Adobe Experience Platform has been several years in the making and we\u2019ve seen tremendous enthusiasm from customers for this solution with multiple pilot deployments already in market. We continue to be the leader in Customer Experience Management, which has a TAM of more than$70 billion by 2021. While we experienced some bookings delays in Q3, our robust product roadmap and customer pipeline positions us for multiple years of strong growth. ","At Adobe, we continue to invest in our employees, who are the heart and soul of our company. Last week at our annual Adobe for All Summit, we reaffirmed global gender pay parity for our workforce, and shared new details and data on our opportunity parity initiative, which examines fairness in promotion rates and access to new opportunities for our employees. Adobe is the leader in several large and growing categories, creativity, digital documents and customer experience management. We remain excited about the opportunities in front of us and confident in our ability to drive strong top-line and bottom-line growth. John. ","John Murphy","Thanks, Shantanu. In Q3 FY19, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.83 billion, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.61 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.05. Business and financial highlights in Q3 included, record Digital Media revenue of $1.96 billion, including record Creative revenue of $1.65 billion and record Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $307 million. Strong net new Digital Media ARR of $386 million; Record Digital Experience revenue of $821 million; Remaining Performance Obligation, or RPO, grew to $8.77 billion; Cash flow from operations of $922 million; Repurchasing 2.6 million shares of our stock; and approximately 92% of our revenue in Q3 was from recurring sources.","In our Digital Media segment, we achieved record revenue with 22% year-over-year growth. The addition of $386 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $7.86 billion. Within Digital Media, we achieved another strong quarter with our Creative business. Creative revenue grew 22% year-over-year in Q3, and we increased Creative ARR by $314 million. Strong acquisition, up sell and retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions continued during Q3, and were driven by New user growth, helped by many global initiatives to generate demand, including targeted campaigns and promotions, a large funnel of users coming from desktop and mobile; and leveraging Adobe\u2019s brand and new products to expand into adjacent creative categories. ","Increasing adoption of single app offerings, including Adobe Premiere Pro for video and Adobe Illustrator for artwork. Continued growth in international markets, including greater than 40% year-over-year unit growth in key emerging markets. Ongoing success in the enterprise, including new logos, seat expansion and services adoption which drives higher contract value; and adoption of creative services including Adobe Stock, where revenue grew greater than 30% year-over-year. ","Our momentum with Document Cloud accelerated in Q3. We achieved Document Cloud revenue of $307 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth, and we added a record $72 million of net new Document Cloud ARR during the quarter. Strong Document Cloud performance during Q3 was driven by subscription demand across key routes to market with individuals, small and mid-market businesses, and large enterprises; the continued migration of Acrobat perpetual customers to subscriptions, enterprise services adoption and the conversion of free mobile Reader users to paid subscriptions. Adobe Sign revenue grew greater than 25% year-over-year.","In our Digital Experience segment, we achieved quarterly Experience Cloud revenue of $821 million, which represents 34% year-over-year growth. Experience Cloud subscription revenue was a record $679 million, growing 37% year-over-year. ","While we had strong overall revenue in Q3, our subscription bookings growth for Marketo in the mid-market did not meet our expectations, which is being addressed by increasing our focus and investment on demand generation and inside sales. In addition, there were Analytics Cloud subscription bookings delays with related shortfalls in consulting services bookings and revenue associated with the launch of our new Adobe Experience Platform. We are confident the enhanced innovation in Analytics Cloud, the introduction of our Real-Time CDP product, and the ongoing global roll-out of the Adobe Experience Platform will convert strong customer demand and the current pipeline into bookings starting in Q4.","We now expect to grow our total Digital Experience subscription bookings in fiscal 2019 by greater than 20% year-over-year. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $8.5 million. We had $10.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY19, versus $9 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY19; thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $6.7 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $38.3 million. The $10.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY19 versus $16.8 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY18 resulted in a net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains of $44.3 million. ","In Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 5% on a GAAP basis and 11% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 44 days, which compares to 41 days in the year-ago quarter, and 42 days last quarter. Remaining Performance Obligation or RPO was approximately $8.77 billion exiting Q3, which compares to $8.37 billion exiting Q2. Deferred revenue exiting Q3 was $3.26 billion. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q3 was $3.65 billion, and cash flow from operations was $922 million in the quarter. In Q3 we repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $750 million. We currently have $5.85 billion remaining of our $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018 which goes through 2021.","Turning to our targets, considering second half Digital Experience bookings and consulting revenue, in Q4 FY19 we are targeting revenue of approximately 2 billion 970 million dollars; Digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%; Net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $450 million; Digital Experience segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 23%; Net non-operating expense of approximately $20 million; Tax rate of approximately 11% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis; Share count of approximately 490 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.68; and Non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.25.","We look forward to a strong finish for the year, and sharing insights with you about our strategy and opportunities at our financial analyst meeting at MAX. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Mike.","Mike Saviage","Thanks, John. Adobe MAX is less than two months away.

We would now be happy to take your questions, and we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question of a day from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","KeithWeiss","Thank you guys for taking the question. And very nice quarter particularly on digital media side of the equation. It does sound like you guys are having some sort of go-to-market and disruption impacts on the digital experience side of equation. I was hoping if you could dig in a little bit further to help us explain exactly what's going on that side of the business. What does it take to fix that? Because it's definitely something like you were much more optimistic about that business a quarter ago. And then maybe one for John is there any margin impact in terms of increasing investment and inside sales and some other go-to -market stuff that is going to take to get experience clouds back up to the growth rates you guys are expecting.","ShantanuNarayen","Great. Keith as you pointed out, it was a strong quarter, we were pleased with the growth across the businesses. Since I suspect that there'll be a couple of people asking about digital experience, let me go into a little bit more color on that particular opportunity. And let me clarify that wasn't any impact associated with macro. The interest from enterprises all sizes, different verticals in our comprehensive solutions remains incredibly strong. And even if you look at the targets that we've provided, it's clear that we are delivering strong revenue growth while actually accelerating the subscription bookings year-over-year on what is a much larger book of business because we do an apples-to-apples comparison.","I think as you think about Q3, it's clear we have leading solutions in the first mile and the last mile. So Adobe Experience Manager campaign and Magento had strong growth. The Magento acquisition\u2019s been viewed exceedingly well by customers. It's clearly very strategic and we grew the book of business greater than 40% in Q3. And actually have done a really good job of taking Magento into the enterprise. The other part that we're absolutely clear about is that there's a new generation of enterprise software that's going to emerge which will be required to digitally engage with customers across all these multiple channels. What it has to do is deliver first mile content experiences, that\u2019s the content and commerce piece.","It has to segment audiences now in real time across multiple channels. You have to do customer journey management and orchestration and you have to provide data and insights to enable these AI services. We've been focused on this opportunity just like we created the digital marketing category. We believe this is absolutely crucial for the experience business and so we built the Adobe experience platform from scratch to deliver what we call DDOM in terms of how we run our own digital business. Customers are really excited. It's the first software actually that exists that's designed to specifically integrate the needs of the CMO, the Chief Revenue Officer and the CIO.","So our strategy with the Adobe Experience platform is that we want to actually augment the analytics capability, the audience manager capability with what we are doing with these new services as well as the real-time CDP in the market. We're really excited about the multiple installations that we have as well as the interest globally. You can argue we were maybe a tad aggressive, Keith, about the timing adoption, but this phase shift that we've seen in no way diminishes the magnitude of the opportunity or my belief in the lead that we have. And so as I think about the business, as we think about the targets, we're leading in this particular category. We saw as I said some delays in the bookings, but that has in no way changed our excitement and optimism about the business. So hopefully that helps give you some color associated with each of the businesses.","The last thing I would say is that we talked about Marketo specifically. And there I would say our natural inclination was to perhaps focus our aspirations on the enterprise business, serve our existing customers that's going well. Mid market continues to be a huge growth opportunity. We have the leading product in that space and much like we drove growth in the Magento business; our focus will now be the same on Magento as well as Marketo. And so we've created a unified organization; it's going to drive - align demand generation, customer support. We have the right individuals in the field. It's organized the right way. So I'm excited about that as well. I know I was a little long, but I thought I'd just give you color associated with all of those businesses. And again the Adobe Experience platform that is really our platform that deals with future of what we are doing around analytic services, what we are doing around campaign services. And so when bookings are light you certainly see some impact on consulting as well.","JohnMurphy","Yes. Keith, to answer your question on investments here. They've been factored into the targets that we issued for Q4. And as you've seen those targets we continue to expand, our operating margin as we had expected through the year as we said the second half would accelerate expansion. So the investments are embedded in those targets and as Shantanu said, we're focused on really driving that big market motion like we did with Magento.","Operator","Next we hear from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. ","KirkMaterne","Thanks very much. Maybe I\u2019ll flip over to the digital media side the business which actually had a really strong quarter. Shantanu maybe the stat that stood out to me was actually some of the subs growth in the emerging markets. And can you just provide a little bit more detail on that sort of how you feel like you're monetizing those opportunities, how that is coming along? And maybe just talk a little bit about the opportunity maybe internationally because I know that sort of just sort of taking off right now. Thanks.","ShantanuNarayen","Sure, Kirk. And yes when we look at digital media ARR both across the creative as well as the document business, we just continue to see strength. If you look at our targets for the combined year, I mean it's clear that driving approximately $1.6 billion of net new digital media ARR. Creativity and design have never been important. A couple of points; the first is mobile. What we've been doing with the mobile applications and having mobile be an on-ramp especially in international as well as key emerging markets. What we've seen with the Lightroom system that we've developed photography is such a universal phenomenon and Lightroom's a great product.","So we're driving adoption across a couple of dimensions. The first is the number of people who come in from mobile and only buy a mobile subscription through an app store. The people who come in through mobile but then realize that there's more to Adobe's creative offerings and then come in and download a desktop application as well as then adopted. We're seeing significant growth for document cloud also in these international markets as they are migrating from the perpetual version of the product as well as engaging on the web. This is something that we started to talk about which is people just coming from a web; they want to create a PDF; they want to export PDF. That's seeing traction. So and frankly Stock we actually did some really interesting work with Stock. Stock was a primarily a US product but as you have more international content, as you have the search capabilities available, so the services revenue is also increasing. So just across the board as we talk about new customer acquisition, as we talk about focus on engagement, mobile certainly has momentum and services like Adobe Stock both in the US as well as international. And the last thing I'll say is that the DDOM that we have really gives us insight into what's effective in those markets. So rather than have a one-size-fits-all where we spend our money digitally, how we engage with our customers; how do we price the products appropriately. China is again seeing really good growth as it relates to our team offering and creative cloud. And so across the board, it just reflects creativity as important and we're the leader.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies.","BrentThill","Great. Shantanu just back on the digital experience business, if you plug in your fourth quarter guide, you're going to come in a few points below your full year guide. And I'm just curious I think the Marketo mid-market and some of the other explanations makes sense, but this has been something historically that's been fairly inconsistent. I guess a question is how do you get back to more consistency in making numbers in this business? And if you could just comment as it relates to your [linear] [ph], why it taking so long to get someone in that seat for the new role. Thank you.","ShantanuNarayen","Well, couple of questions in there, Brent. And the first one is I would say as I pointed out at the beginning, we're growing our subscription book of business which is a much larger subscription book of business greater in 2019 that we did in 2018. So I think putting that in perspective, I would say clearly with the mid market our motion was perhaps a lot more in the enterprise. We saw tremendous success with Magento in the enterprise and creating a demand generation machine. I think having that aligned organization part of what I've done is I've been running this business is to align all of them quicker. I wish I'd done it even earlier in terms of having a combined Magento and Marketo mid market offering because that demand generation is a machine. So I'm confident that we'll see improvements as a result of those organizational changes.","And the Adobe Experience platform when you look at it, Brent, nobody's delivered something like this. It is so innovative. We talked about it being groundbreaking and much like we did with digital marketing which is when we first came out we were decades ahead of the competition. We feel excited about that; customer interest is high; there's an ongoing on-ramp and maybe we were a tad aggressive but when you have the leader and you're driving such innovation, we have to be optimistic about what we are doing for customers. And we experience firsthand what it takes.","So we're confident that we will continue to grow that business the way we have. And as it relates to the organization, I think I mentioned this last time as well. I intentionally put that on hold because I needed to get all of those organizations aligned. The product roadmap, the innovation roadmap that exists right now, Brent, is stronger than it's ever been as a result I think of various help over the last six months. What we are doing with delivering new services; the AI and intelligence services that are available; the delivery of the Adobe Experience platform; what we've done with content and commerce. Aligning that and getting that unified that is clearly the sweet spot of where other is helping and where I focused.","And I think that would not have happened without somebody doing that directly. And so I'm actually pleased that I did it. And aligned the organization first. So it's in great shape for somebody when they come in.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jennifer Lowe with UBS.","JenniferLowe","Great. Thank you. And maybe just to follow up on Brent's question little bit because there were a number of different items that came up there both in terms of getting greater product alignment in terms of Marketo and Magento and also organizational alignment. So is it possible to just sort of at a high level give us a sense of how much of this is product related issue of just trying to get the products working together versus just organizational? And as you think about how long this will take to kind of get back to where you'd like to be? Is that something that could happen in a quarter or two? Or could this be a more extended timeline to get all the things working the way you want them to?","ShantanuNarayen","So, Jennifer, again multiple questions there. First, let me let me end with that which is in Q4 we expect substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings in that particular business. So let me start off by that. I think when you introduce an upgrade to the analytics which is now available through the Adobe Experience platform; the customer adoption has been good. It doesn't have to do with the product issue. The product is years ahead of the competition as I said. It's a new motion. I mean what we went through, as we went through our digital transformation; people have to get ready for that adoption. And we are seeing that right now; we're seeing the on-ramp. So I would put that less as any product issue definitely not a customer demand issue.","And it's just one of those things that you work through and you work through aggressively to ensure that customers get the value that they want. And again in Q4, we expect a substantial increase in quarter-over-quarter bookings based on the pipeline and based on what we would do.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. ","MarkMoerdler","Thank you and congrats on the quarter also. This quarter even with the integration work in sales expansion driven by Marketo and Magento acquisition, you delivered a really good operating margin. Given what you looking --sounds like you're going to do in terms of the increased mid market focus in other areas, any reason why we shouldn't continue to see that margin continue to move up. Thank you.","ShantanuNarayen","Well, Mark, if you look at our sort of guidance for Q4 and look at what the operating margin guidance would be on the revenue that we outlined and GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, it's clear that we are continuing to focus on the margin as well. And I think at the beginning of the year we had said you would start to see margins back in the 40%, that's certainly there. However, big picture I would say we really focused on the long-term opportunity and continuing to drive top-line growth. But the margins and the leverage in the model you saw that in Q3 as well across the business. And you are right in that the mid market motions are more marketing and generated by demand through the website and less through direct sales. So that would be better margins than perhaps an enterprise business. ","Operator","Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities has our next question.","JayVleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening. Shantanu, I'd like to ask a sequel to the technology question I asked a quarter ago although without the plethora of three-letter acronyms that we talked about at the time. And still however with intent to understand how you're thinking about your technology or platform as a driver to content velocity usage and ultimately retention. So the question tonight is about AEM? Next year is the 10th anniversary of the Day acquisition and as best we can tell you've quintupled or more the revenue from that product. So perhaps you just talk about how you're thinking about the ongoing momentum in AEM? Any fundamental investments or re-architecture you work you need to do or are doing in AEM to continue to drive that as the focal point of DX? And then just a quick clarification in terms of the fixes that you talk about at least for mid-market in DX, are you planning to accelerate or implement any more of the self-service capabilities that we've talked about there besides the inside sales and other things you talked about tonight.","ShantanuNarayen","So let me answer the second question first, Jay, which is certainly both the Magento and Marketo we have both self-serve capabilities as well as a ecosystem of partners. As you know with Magento having the open source community help us not just with bringing us leads, but also helping integrate with any point of sale or inventory or supply chain systems. It's a huge advantage and I think we're leveraging that. And also as it relates to Magento, we've already integrated that with our AEM. On AEM, content just continues to be a significant, significant differentiator and I referred to it earlier as the first mile experience that every customer has with a digital enterprise. Some really exciting things underway there. As you know, when we acquired Day Software that was a perpetual business, I think we effectively transitioned it to be a managed services business.","We have some really exciting plans underway that we're starting to deliver to customers as it relates to fully SaaS-ifying that and making that even more self-serve in terms of people using that technology. When you think about what's happening with what's called headless content management that's an area of significant investment for us, so that people can automate their content production. AEM assets which is the assets product, there's a lot of excitement for that for content velocity as you pointed out. We talked a little bit less about AEM forms, but AEM forms also is a way in which people want to use AEM technology, so AEM has really become a platform; it's your web infrastructure which really exciting for us is there isn't a digital event that happens. Whether it's debate, companies introducing product launches, sports events that aren't completely run sort of on Adobe technology.","And that's really exciting to see when we see these spikes in our traffic; we know what's happening in virtually every online event. And AEM is at the core of that. AEM had a strong quarter; it continues to be a way in which people are re-platforming their web and so stay tuned for more. But hopefully that gives you a glimpse of some of the things that we're doing. The move to SaaS; the move towards headless content and asset management are maybe three of the ones I'd identified.","Operator","Our next question will come from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","HeatherBellini","Great. Thank you. I just wanted to go back to a couple questions that were asked previously. One just thinking through the digital experience and some of the comments you made, can you give us a sense is it- is there anything to do from a competitive standpoint here? Is it really all go-to-market? And I'm just wondering kind of who you're seeing most frequently and if that's changed? And then I think to Jen's question kind of talking about margins, I was wondering if you could speak a little bit about OpEx growth? And based on your comments and your guide for the Q4 and as such the full year, when we think about parsing your comment about investing for growth and margin, how should we be thinking about the pace of OpEx growth going forward? I mean you guys have been 20% or higher for the last few years. Obviously, there's M&A included in that, but should we be expecting just given the opportunities that are ahead of you kind of similar type growth rates as we start to think about the period ahead. Thank you.","ShantanuNarayen","Sure. So let me answer the first question, while there may be some point solutions that have point competitors or products that are there in the market that do similar technology for the vast majority of what we offer in digital experience, we are the undisputed leaders. And really as we talk about the innovation for new things like Adobe Experience platform, the real-time CDP, what we are doing with intelligence services, Heather, were, there really isn't anybody else who's offering capabilities similar to what we have in the market.","I think as it relates to M&A if that was a question, there is nothing major that we look at and feel like is a gap currently in our portfolio. I think the combination of Magento and Marketo and what we've done with the Adobe Experience platform that gives us without a doubt the leading platform and a significant portfolio to continue to drive growth. I think what we are doing on the document side with the verbs and having the ability for people to embed PDFs or think of it as a PDF service, we're pretty excited about the opportunity associated with that. And we talk about creative. So hopefully that gives you a flavor as we talk about the $100 billion addressable market that's really driving our growth at this point. ","HeatherBellini","And then question on OpEx right, OpEx growth. ","JohnMurphy","Yes. Well, again on all-expense really, I mean I think when we look at margins in general where our goal is to continue to invest in top-line growth, but then obviously drive efficiencies both and how we look at our COGS and how we're looking at the rest of the P&L. And so you see that here in Q3 we are able to vary through a lot of like relentless fiscal discipline contribute to the lower OpEx in Q3 than probably was modeled and it came through and obviously in the EPS performance. And you'll see that again in Q4 as we've modeled it out. You see the operating margin expand again in Q4 based upon our targets.","So we're diligently focused on that from time to time like we did with the acquisitions. We found opportunities to invest in growth and we'll do that, but the idea is to really always focus on growing our earnings as fast if not faster than revenue.","Operator","Our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital.","SaketKalia","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. John maybe for you and I apologize for the background noise by the way. Adobe continues to do a good job on generating new creative ARR. And so as you think about next year understanding that we aren't giving guidance yet, can you just talk about so the puts and takes to how ARR may look next year, particularly with some of the benefit of pricing that we got in fiscal 2019?","JohnMurphy","When I look at ARR in more philosophically because obviously we have Analyst Day coming up where we'll actually talk a lot about next year. We've laid out many, many times the different drivers that we have and Shantanu covered a number of them when he talked about that earlier to the earlier question. So we have international markets. We've got new products. We've got single apps and mobile on-ramp that are really driving new users to the platform. And that's our -- one of our biggest growth areas. And that's still a focus for us. Yes, we have, I think other folks have asked about promotions before as well. And we use those; we've seen through our DDOM model that they're very effective in driving new users and then converting those to paid users.","So overall we've got a number of vectors that we believe we can continue to grow ARR in the future and beyond.","Operator","Alek Zukin with RBC Capital Markets has our next question.","AleksandrZukin","Thanks for taking the question. So maybe just the first one about the -- if it's possible to unpack kind of the -- where the greater magnitude of the bookings kind of headwinds came from, whether it was more the mid-market Marketo side or whether it was the Analytics side. And then just maybe one for John about the cash flow, outperformance in the quarter was a bit below our numbers. Was there -- were there any onetime issues there that should self-correct?","ShantanuNarayen","Yes. Alek, as it relates to the bookings I would in order a sort of priority first talk about the analytics as it's moving to the Adobe Experience Manager, so the combination of analytics and audience manager sort of moving to experience platform with the real-time CDP. And then to a lesser extent the Marketo mid-market. So that's sort of how I would look at it as people are transitioning and upgrading to the Adobe Experience platform.","JohnMurphy","And on cash flow, we're actually pretty happy with the performance, but we did have someone times in the quarter. We ended up taking advantage of some favorable vendor pricing by doing a couple large prepayments. And then also we had some timing of some tax payments in the quarter as well. So those impacted that, but excluding those items would've been well above a $1 billion in the quarter.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","SterlingAuty","Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. You mentioned the softness in the Marketo bookings, specifically mid-market. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of that business is usually targeted towards mid market? And is there a different kind of product set or requirement than what you're currently offering that you think you need to deliver to get it back on track?","ShantanuNarayen","Sterling, I think first to put it in perspective we saw growth. We're talking about the acceleration and mid market the way we did it for Magento in terms of sort of growing it across the enterprise. And so I think it's really all about having the demand generation machine, which is easier to fix in terms of getting that sort of motion going again in the company. And in terms of it being self-serve, I mean the product is actually applicable already across the mid-market and enterprise. So there are no product issues there. It really has been as I said the natural inclination was to go in the enterprise. And so continuing to accelerate the mid-market in addition to enterprise like we're focusing on Magento. And having that as an aligned organization so we can leverage our marketing is the two changes we've made.","SterlingAuty","And the general split enterprise versus mid-market in that business?","ShantanuNarayen","We have such good market share across both of those segments as the leading B2B segment; it really is well penetrated across both. If there's any --this probably more penetration in the mid market and the smaller size of the large enterprises than the large enterprise, Sterling, if I were to give you some color on their current penetration within the enterprise.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kas Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","KasthuriRangan","Hi, thank you very much. Shantanu, I just want to clarify, generally when you put out a newly integrator platform, the enterprise market is one that's a little bit more demanding and so they are the ones that are likely to delay purchasing, but here it appears that it's more on the mid-market side. So I'm just curious to get a little bit more color. What else could do you need to see in the product by which the customer base can move forward with confidence? And I've got to believe that just based on the new guidance for Q4 that we're not expecting a snapback in marketing or what used to be called marketing cloud bookings. So therefore should we expect whatever you expected for this year to actually happen next year, while not being specific about a growth rate. Thank you so much. ","ShantanuNarayen","So, Kas, first with respect to the bookings, let me again reiterate what we said in the prepared remarks, which is we would expect the overall subscription book of business for all of the experienced cloud across mid market, across enterprise and across all solutions to be greater than 20%. So I wanted to make sure that that was understood despite what we saw in Q3. I think as it relates to your first question, the integrated platform that is really aimed more at the enterprise and that's the natural migration of analytics and audience manager customers.","I think the mid-market is specifically as it relates to Marketo, so I just wanted to clarify that. And so there are no issues with respect to adoption in the enterprise, if anything as I said we were maybe a tad aggressive with how quickly they would adopt it, but we do expect to see substantial bookings in Q4 quarter-over-quarter.","KasthuriRangan","Got it. And the outlook for this combined newly integrated platform going into next year. What are the things that you could do or customers can do that they could not do with the previous product? Just trying to understand qualitatively how this changes things for Adobe. That's it. Congrats.","ShantanuNarayen","Well, I think what we've been through, Kash, with our own move to digital, the ability to have a real-time platform where you can actually activate what happens to customers across multiple channels, it doesn't exist. I mean the first generation of dealing with these customers is a record in a database that is completely inadequate in terms of how people can engage with customers. So this is absolutely groundbreaking in terms of what can be done. So think of it as you know how many times have you gone to a website; you've bought a product and then the ad for that product continues to dog you for weeks.","And maybe sometimes to add insult to injury, it actually says there's a discount now available for that product. That's sort of the thing that we're addressing or when you call in to a customer support and you've done something in a retail store or you've done something online and it has no idea about who you are and what you did. So I think this real-time CDP; the other massive movement that you know is happening is between known and unknown and the movement towards that with browsers. So we're the first to convert what was our leading position with DMP or data management into real time CDP or a customer data platform.","So this is the ability to have one single unified view of a customer across multiple channels, understand how you acquire them; understand how you engage with them. So that's really what I think is an imperative for every company doing digital transformation. So that's our opportunity and our lead.","Operator","Our next question will come from Walter Pritchard with Citi.","WalterPritchard","Hi. Sorry for the background noise here. John, just question for you on pricing as a driver. I've noticed in the past you have outlined in this quarter, you outlined the different -- some of the different drivers in the script. And I didn't see pricing there. I'm wondering sort of how pricing both the expiration of the promotional pricing as well as some of the pricing actions you taking over the last 18-months are faring as drivers of the creative business compared to what you've seen in recent quarters. Thanks.","JohnMurphy","Sure, Walter. Yes, pricing is certainly is a lever; it's not one that we've ever used really as a driver for an annual price increase to increase ARR for instance. One of the things that we look at is the value that we're providing to the customers. And when we provide the value and we see that value resonate with customers then we price it accordingly. What we saw this year, of course, was the price increase that we did I should say last year for North America and then this year internationally in Australia and Japan, we seen those price increases be well accepted. We've customers who stay on the platform and the value was resonating.","So it's something that we'll look at. It's not a core driver, but something that is one of the many levers that we can use to grow.","Operator","Our final question will come from Chris Eberle with Nomura Instinet.","ChrisEberle","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. I just wanted to touch on advertising really quickly. We had noticed that back in August Google had shut out Adobe PSP from their ad exchange. Can you talk about if that had any effect at all or maybe just kind of remind us the size of that business down, if it's material at all? Thanks. ","ShantanuNarayen","So the easy answer to that it really had no impact. That was one day in one part of Europe as a result of customer who used it inappropriately and we were backup and running. So that really had no issue. I mean the advertising business for us is important part of the Experience Cloud business. It allows the CMOs to have real attribution associated with their marketing spend. It helps with customer acquisition as the on ramp to a digital business. So it plays a strategic role and we have good offering and that it cuts across all of the different channels that people are looking to acquire customers on namely TV, search, display and video. ","So I think in particular where we are strongest right now is certainly in helping people with the new media type such as video and TV. So that's it as it relates to the ad business. I mean given that was the last question; I continue to believe that Adobe is not just driving but we are creating large market opportunities. We were pleased with our fiscal performance in Q3. And I am particularly pleased with the product road map and innovation that we are delivering across all three clouds to what is increasingly and incredibly diverse set of customers. Our strategy empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is certainly working. And we are executing against that strategy. Design and creativity have never been important. You've seen the strength in both the creative as well as the document business.","And digital transformation and digitization continues to be an incredible opportunity. Clearly, FY19 will be another record year with strong cash flow and margin expansion. And as a plug, particularly excited about the innovation that we are going to showcase at MAX. It's going to be our largest Creative Event. And I hope to see you join us in LA for both MAX as well as our FA meeting. Thank you for joining us today.

FY '17 was another strong year for Adobe, highlighted by record Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and Experience Cloud revenue and capped off by the first ever $2 billion quarter in company history.","In Q4 we delivered revenue of $2.01 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $1, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.26. For the year we grew total revenue to $7.3 billion which represents 25% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY '17 was $3.38 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $4.31.","Our strong results are validation of the relevance of Adobe's mission to change the world through digital experiences. That vision serves a broad and diversified set of customers from artists, students and anyone with a story to tell to the world's most prestigious brands, media companies and institutions all of whom are betting their future on Adobe as they embrace the opportunities of digital transformation.","In digital media Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud are fundamental to how people and businesses communicate, entertain and engage with each other. We exited the year with more than 5.2 billion of digital media annualized recurring revenue or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was 359 million, fueled by our ability to attract and retain new users, deepened product engagement and drive new opportunities through services.","Creative Cloud remains the gold standard for creativity and design. Tens of millions of people use Creative Cloud and it is becoming the creativity platform for all. We achieved Creative revenue of 1.16 billion in Q4. For the year we achieved Creative revenue of 4.2 billion which represents 31% year-over-year growth.","At our annual Max Creativity Conference in October we introduced the next generation of Creative Cloud including a set of new applications across the design, video and photography segments. Highlights included the introduction of Adobe XD, our tool for end-to-end UX\/UI design, Adobe Dimension, which greatly simplifies 3D design, Adobe Character Animator, which brings 2D puppets to life using voice, facial expressions and gestures; and Adobe Lightroom CC, our photography cloud service that works across desktop, mobile and web to edit, organize, store and share photos.","We have delivered on Creative Cloud\u2019s promise to bring continuous innovation through updates to our flagship products including Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere Pro. We introduced a premium version of Adobe Spark, our tool for helping everyone communicate their ideas visually. Spark with Premium Features offers enhanced customization capabilities for branded graphics, web pages, and video stories and is a key part of Adobe\u2019s strategy to introduce our creative tools to a wider audience of storytellers.","The value of Creative Cloud is enhanced through the delivery of innovative new cloud services. Adobe Stock has continued its steady growth as we innovate in areas like aesthetic search and introduce new features and content such as Motion Graphics templates. We\u2019ve continued to add new contributor features to Adobe Stock, allowing our community to customize their portfolios and present their best work. ","Last week we announced that Scott Belsky, co-founder of Behance, returned to Adobe as Chief Product Officer, and EVP of Creative Cloud and has joined my staff. Scott is one of the most admired leaders in the design community. In this role, he will focus on product delivery and driving long-term innovation for Creative Cloud products and services. Scott will partner closely with Bryan Lamkin, EVP and General Manager of Digital Media, as we continue to push the boundaries of what\u2019s possible with Creative Cloud and drive continued growth and customer engagement.","The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, is enabling businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was 235 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to 600 million. We achieved annual revenue of 837 million for Document Cloud in FY'17. ","Mobile has become the new frontier for Document Cloud. This quarter, we announced new updates to Adobe Scan which leverage Adobe Sensei to capture and create intelligent PDFs on your mobile device. To date, Adobe Scan has had more than 5 million downloads. Adobe Creative is the leader in the digital marketing category, which has redefined the enterprise software landscape. Today, we are targeting the much broader Experience Business opportunity which we estimate to be a 53 billion addressable market in 2020. In Q4 we achieved Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of 550 million, resulting in annual revenue of 2.03 billion.","In an era when entire industries are being disrupted, every business must now compete for the hearts and minds of their customers with every click and every interaction. With Adobe Experience Cloud, we are transforming how businesses compete in this new reality. Our offering includes Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Analytics Cloud and Adobe Advertising Cloud, making it the industry\u2019s most complete and integrated offering. ","Adobe Advertising Cloud is the first end-to-end platform that helps marketers manage their ad spend across all digital formats including display, search and video, as well as traditional TV. It\u2019s been a year since our acquisition of TubeMogul and we have successfully integrated the technology with Adobe Media Optimizer. This has played a key role in driving strong Advertising Cloud performance and leadership in the digital advertising space. We introduced several advancements to Advertising Cloud, including the release of the Adobe Advertising Cloud Mobile App, the industry\u2019s first mobile app for cross-channel advertising campaign management. ","Adobe Analytics Cloud continues to be the intelligence engine for the enterprise, combining digital and offline data to help brands move from insight to action. Recently, Gartner positioned Adobe as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Analytics research report, for the third year in a row. Adobe was also recognized as a leader in the recent The Forrester Wave: Web Analytics report. ","Adobe Experience Cloud processed approximately 65 trillion data transactions for its customers in Q4, and 186 trillion data transactions in the trailing four quarters. The insights gleaned from this data provide a valuable window into customer behavior and business trends. Our annual Holiday Shopping Report has become the industry benchmark for measuring the trajectory of ecommerce spending and trends. This year we accurately predicted Cyber Monday to be the largest online sales day in U.S. history. Underscoring the importance of delivering a great mobile shopping experience, revenue driven by smartphones hit an all-time high of more than $1.59 billion on Cyber Monday.","Together with Microsoft, we are now enabling enterprise marketers to deliver one-to-one personalization of web content at scale and connect any lead generation data captured on the web to their CRM system through Adobe Experience Manager integration with Microsoft Dynamics 365. To date, more than 50 enterprises leverage Adobe and Microsoft\u2019s joint offerings including Air Canada, Great West Life Assurance and the U.S. Army.","Other significant customer wins in the quarter included Allianz, Barclays, BNP Paribas, IKEA, JPMorgan, Mattel, and Opel.","The centerpiece of our innovation efforts across Adobe is Sensei, our artificial intelligence and machine learning framework. We\u2019ve invested heavily to make Sensei a foundational part of our offerings to both our creative and enterprise customers. With Adobe\u2019s massive volume of content and data assets fueling Adobe Sensei, and our unmatched domain expertise in creativity, documents and experiences, Sensei is a critical differentiator for our business.","Last week, we celebrated Adobe\u2019s 35th anniversary. I know I speak for our 18,000 Adobe employees around the world when I share how proud we are of everything we\u2019ve achieved as a company, not only the strong business results, but the impact Adobe has made in the markets we serve and in the communities where we do business.","We were recently recognized by Glassdoor as a 2018 Best Places to Work, as well as a World\u2019s Best Workplace and one of the Best Workplaces for Diversity by Fortune.","We recently announced that Adobe has achieved equal pay between men and women in the U.S., an important milestone in Adobe\u2019s ongoing efforts to create an inclusive and rewarding environment for all employees. ","The pride in what we\u2019ve accomplished is exceeded by our excitement about Adobe\u2019s future. With our strong brand, our compelling strategy, and our culture of innovation, our best days remain ahead of us. We\u2019re looking forward to a fantastic 2018. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2017 results. In FY17, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $7.3 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. ","GAAP EPS for the year was $3.38, and non-GAAP EPS was $4.31. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy, and noteworthy achievements, including record Creative revenue with 31% year-over-year revenue growth and exiting the year with $4.63 billion of Creative ARR; record Document Cloud revenue of $837 million and exiting the year with $600 million of Document Cloud ARR; record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $2.03 billion, which represents 24% annual year-over-year growth. Generating a record $2.91 billion in operating cash flow during the year, growing deferred revenue to approximately $2.5 billion, and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.9 billion exiting the year; together, this represents approximately $6.4 billion of contracted revenue; and returning over $1.1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program.","In the fourth quarter of FY'17, Adobe achieved record revenue of $2.01 billion, which represents 25% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.00 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.26. ","Highlights in Q4 included: record Creative revenue of $1.16 billion; record Adobe Document Cloud revenue of $235 million; record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $550 million; record net new Digital Media ARR of $359 million; and record cash flow from operations of $833 million. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $359 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew the total to $5.23 billion exiting Q4.","Within Digital Media, Creative revenue grew 30% year-over-year and we increased Creative ARR by $315 million during Q4. The strong quarter for our Creative business was achieved across several areas: strong net new subscriptions, helped by increased Adobe.com traffic after the Adobe MAX announcements and end-of-year promotions; stable or improving ARPU across key offerings; the attachment of services with Team and Enterprise offerings; and continued momentum with Adobe Stock.","With Document Cloud, we achieved record revenue with 23% year-over-year growth. The performance in Q4 was driven by continued strength with Acrobat subscription adoption, normal Q4 enterprise seasonality, and strong year-end Acrobat perpetual product licensing through the channel. Unit growth for Acrobat DC across Creative Cloud and Document Cloud accelerated again in Q4, pushing total year-over-year Acrobat unit growth to over 20% for FY'17. Adobe Sign also achieved strong results, and contributed to Document Cloud ARR growth.","In Digital Marketing, we exceeded $2 billion of Adobe Experience Cloud revenue for the year, with 24% annual revenue growth. Advertising Cloud had a strong year, and we achieved the expectations we set in January for TubeMogul. ","Excluding the addition of TubeMogul, Experience Cloud subscription revenue grew 22% year-over-year during FY'17. Subscription revenue growth was helped by strong performance with Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Campaign and Adobe Audience Manager during the year.","In Q4, we achieved record Adobe Experience Cloud revenue of $550 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth. We drove strong sequential subscription bookings growth from Q3 to Q4, reflecting typical enterprise year-end strength. Multi-solution selling in our top accounts and strong bookings of the Adobe\/Microsoft solutions drove this sequential growth.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by 11.1 million. We had 1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY'17, versus 0.2 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY'17; thus, the net sequential currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was 11.9 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX increased revenue by 4.1 million. ","We had 1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY'17, versus 8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY'16; thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was 3 million. In Q4, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 22% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 55 days, which compares to 47 days in the year-ago quarter, and 50 days last quarter. ","Our DSO has increased slightly over the past year given the nature of the Advertising Cloud business model and the addition of the TubeMogul business. Deferred revenue grew to a record 2.49 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q4 was 5.8 billion. ","Cash flow from operations was a record 833 million in the quarter. In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.9 million shares at a cost of 297 million. During the year, we repurchased 8.2 million shares, returning 1.1 billion dollars to stockholders. We have approximately 1.9 billion remaining of our 2.5 billion stock repurchase authority granted in January 2017.","Now I will provide our financial outlook. Entering FY'18, we are excited about our momentum and the large addressable markets we discussed at our recent analyst meeting. We remain well-positioned to continue to deliver strong top-line and bottom line growth. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary we revalue ARR at year-end for the current currency rates. ","FX rate changes between December of last year and this year have resulted in a 154 million increase in Digital Media ARR. This increases our FY'18 beginning Digital Media ARR to 5.39 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor data sheet, and ARR results will be measured against this amount during FY'18.","In FY'18, we are targeting: total adobe revenue of approximately 8.725 billion; digital media segment revenue growth of approximately 23%; Adobe Experience Cloud subscription revenue growth of approximately 20%; adobe experience cloud total revenue growth of approximately 15%; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $4.40; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $5.50; net new digital media ARR of approximately 1.1 billion; and Adobe experience cloud subscription bookings growth of approximately 20%. ","We expect quarterly revenue, earnings per share and Digital Media ARR results to follow similar seasonality as was achieved in FY'2017. In Q1 FY'18, we are targeting: revenue of approximately $2.40 billion; digital Media segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 25%; Experience Cloud year-over-year total revenue growth of approximately 15%; tax rate of approximately 9% on a GAAP basis, and 21% on a non-GAAP basis; share count of approximately 500 million shares; GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.15; non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $1.27; and net new Digital Media ARR of approximately $275 million. As a reminder, our operating cash flow is seasonally higher in Q4, and typically decreases sequentially in Q1 due to several year-end related disbursements made during our first quarter.","In summary, 2017 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader across our key businesses, and are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We\u2019re excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks, Mark. Beginning with our Q1 FY18 earnings report in March, we will modify our segment reporting moving forward. LiveCycle and Connect, which have been reported in our Digital Marketing segment, will be moved to a new segment called Publishing which will include the current Print and Publishing segment products. We will also rename our Digital Marketing segment to Digital Experience. ","As we\u2019ve done in the past, we will publish an updated investor data sheet in late January with historical information adjusted to reflect the segment changes. The updated data sheet will coincide with the issuance of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for FY'17 which will also reflect these changes. ","Adobe Summit, the world\u2019s largest digital marketing conference, is scheduled for the last week in March, with Day One on Tuesday March 27. An invitation with registration and discounted Summit pricing information will be sent out in January to our investor and analyst email list. More details about the conference will be available at summit.adobe.com.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jennifer Lowe. Your line is open. ","Jennifer Lowe","Great, thank you. Mark, I wanted to follow up a little bit on the comment you made about the traffic uptick you saw post MAX to the adobe.com site and you also added promotional activity in there but specifically the post-MAX uptick, was that sort of what you normally would see after a MAX event or was it different this time? And what were the types of products that were really benefitting from that uptick in traffic. Was it the traditional fully configured Creative Cloud or were you seeing more activity around some of the newer product offerings?","Shantanu Narayen ","Why don't I take that? In terms of what we saw after MAX if you recall MAX was perhaps the most productive release ever in the history of the company in terms of the five new products that we had introduced. At the end of Q4 if you look at the business that we have both in terms of single app adoption which continues to grow as well as the CC complete which continues to grow. I would say the photography offering continues to be a very popular offering we introduced a new version of Lightroom and so that\u2019s seeing good traction. ","The second product I would highlight would be XD which is the product for screen design, everything that the creators are doing in terms of designing new interfaces for products across a variety of screens. And then we saw the traditional strength in the existing products that we continue to see namely Photoshop, Illustrator, the video products continue to do well as well. ","So, I think this is something that we do standard which is, we just continue to make sure that we are delivering great innovation for our customers. MAX certainly represents the culmination of a lot of effort and so as expected the attention that we bring to it drives more traffic.","Jennifer Lowe","And maybe just one more if I can. On the Experience Cloud I know in Q3 there was some color around extending sales cycles, bigger deals, the longer sales cycles. I'm curious if that was the trend you saw in Q4 as well or if there was any change there?","Shantanu Narayen ","We had a really strong close to the end of the year so the sequential increase in bookings from Q3 to Q4 as is consistent with year-end seasonality, we were pleased with the strength associated with that in terms of the subscription bookings for the years as well. We were pleased with that advertising cloud had a good quarter as well. So, the opportunity continues to be really large as we talked about the $53 billion-dollar opportunity that we have we\u2019re the undisputed leader. And our innovation is really helping our enterprise customers with their digital transformation needs.","Mark Garrett","And I would add just add a little bit to that subscription bookings were up 20% for the quarter and for the full year which is what we had targeted back at Q3. And the subscription organic revenue I said this in my prepared remarks even without the benefit of 2 was up 22% year-over-year. And that subscription revenue as we have said is the way we are really going to start to measure the health of the business. So, we were really pleased with both of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Mark I'm wondering if relative to what you are thinking about for ARR the progression and the number for the year, you expect any impact from customers buying ahead of this price increase. And any impact you saw generally in terms of customer behavior reacting to that move you made?","Mark Garrett","So, we have not seen any indication that people are buying just ahead of the price increase. We just think the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter was coming off as Shantanu said MAX as well as just Q4 seasonality. And the truth of the matter is if people are buying ahead of the price increase that\u2019s great, because just like we do with promotions that brings people into the franchise and allows us to move them up the ladder so to speak later. So, either way we are happy but we don\u2019t think Q4 was a result of people buying early.","Shantanu Narayen ","A big picture in terms of the overall demand for Creative Cloud, it continues to be clearly the one stop shop for creativity and the increase in the ARR that we issued as a target is more a reflection of just the continued comprehensive nature of the offering, the adoption that we're continuing to see in international markets rather than necessarily anything different in terms of what we expect for the price increase which as we said at the Analyst call we expect to be low this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill. Your line is open.","Brent Thill","On Experience Cloud, Shantanu are there new routes to market, or new ways you're thinking about distribution for that business as you head into the new fiscal year?","Shantanu Narayen ","Yes, Brent, I mean as that business continues to expand and continues to grow well, I think the first phase of that business was clearly everything that we were doing direct with large verticals in what we would call the strategic accounts in specific verticals, and B2C was a big push associated with that, we're seeing quite a bit of adoption in B2B and consistent with the way I think every other enterprise software company would do we're looking not just at the strategic and corporate accounts but expanding into Greenfield territory both in the United States and abroad so that continues to be an area of push and as you can imagine that happens both with our direct sales force as well as with the ecosystem of partners that continues to be really key for us in terms of growth in that business. We talked and touched on the Microsoft partnership and how that's yielding good implementations with customers and we expect that momentum to continue but also whether it'd be digital agencies or SI partners they're certainly bringing us into more of their accounts. So, just continued expansion and we're pleased with the execution that we have there.","Brent Thill","Mark just to clarify on Experience Cloud to Jen\u2019s question, I wanted to be clear, the deals that did push in Q3, it's not like some of those came back into Q4, but did you see other deals extend out into the next fiscal year that were not closed yet?","Shantanu Narayen","Brent maybe I'll take that one as well, I mean the pipeline just continues to be an evergreen pipeline and we're continuing to both close deals, we're continuing to up sell, when we looked at the number of large deals that we have and we think about the number of customers who are adopting multi solution deals that has certainly increased which we look at as good validation of the comprehensive and integrated nature of our product but you've been tracking enterprise software for a long time, we had a great sequential bookings quarter between Q3 and Q4 but pipeline is an evergreen thing that we'll continue to put a lot of focus on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Congrats. Maybe Shantanu first, just on the Document Cloud, you highlighted Acrobat DC units up 20% growth. Any context for that in terms of history and then I had a follow-up for Mark?","Shantanu Narayen ","Sure Ross, I mean I think it's driven a lot by PDF adoption on mobile devices and PDF continuing to be the best way for people to share files across devices, when we think about PDF adoption it actually accelerated in Q4, over the rest of the year which as we've been saying all along was pretty strong. Primarily we've seen people adopt the subscription which is consistent with what we're doing across the Creative Cloud but we also saw some traditional strength that we expect at the end of the year with respect to enterprises continuing to either true up or do licensing of the perpetual version. We're pleased with that and that provided some nice upside. There's a significantly larger install based of Acrobat that isn\u2019t on the subscription and as people continue to adopt both the subscription offering, which is the primary offering, as well as the perpetual that just signifies good growth opportunity for us. But specifically, we saw quite a bit of licensing of the perpetual new Acrobat DC product at the end of the year as enterprises use the end of cycle to true up and buy more product. ","Ross MacMillan","And Mark, just a clarification. So, when you rebase the end of the year Digital Media ARR, the way I think about it is it\u2019s the rebase on the base. So, 154 and 5.23 billion is about 3% rebase. And then every new ARR dollar that comes into fiscal \u201918 is going to be commensurately higher at 3%. I just wanted then to think about that in the context of what you\u2019d said previously about net new ARR of 1 billion and now 1.1 billion, I would argue that\u2019s 10% higher, not 3% higher. So, it\u2019s an implicit raise and I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about that correctly.","Mark Garrett","For sure, this is an implicit raise. ","Shantanu Narayen ","Explicit raise, Ross. ","Ross MacMillan","Explicit raise, I\u2019m just a bit slow tonight.","Mark Garrett","Yes. The 100 million has little to do currency, it\u2019s more based on our over achievement through the year and what we expect to deliver in \u201918. So, it\u2019s not a currency related raise. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss. Your line is open. ","Stan Zlotsky","It\u2019s actually not Keith Weiss, its Stan Zlotsky seating in on his behalf. But thank you so much for taking our question. Around the large deal that you\u2019re seen on ground experience manager and approach services that are associated with those deals. Should we expect given the complexity deal that you part services would maybe take up a little bit in order to dedicate the proper resources to these large strategic implementations?","Shantanu Narayen ","Stan, the Analyst Meeting, we actually talked about given the robustness of the ecosystem that we will be leveraging the ecosystem more to do the actual implementation of these whether they be for the entire marketing cloud or for Adobe experience managers specifically that\u2019s part of the reason, why when we talk about our bookings growth it's going to be greater than the revenue growth that we report, that includes services. So, a great ecosystem of partners, I think we\u2019re focusing on some specialized services with these customers, which is at the very strategic level. But for the most part, we have a great set of partners, who will be doing the heavy lifting associated with the implementation of not just experience manager, but the rest of our solutions and in fact our clouds with the customers. ","Stan Zlotsky","And just a quick follow-up. The 50 joint customers you now have with Microsoft, you mentioned a few sample logos. But from a go-to-market perspective how do these opportunities could develop, who brings into the deal and are the logos that you mentioned are they kind of representative of the typical logo that we would see within that list of 50? Thank you so much.","Shantanu Narayen ","Stan, I think the real goal for us was to demonstrate that we are open for business, the stuff is actually working, customers are excited about as you can expect in these cases, it\u2019s both joint selling between Microsoft and us, its us bringing them into deals, its them bringing us into deals and its partners bringing both of us into deals. So, it's the usual combination that you see in the enterprise in terms of how people adopt software. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini. Your line is open. ","Mark Grant","Hi. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick for me on marketing and analytics. We got the announcement last month, the partnership with Google Analytics and Salesforce. Just wanted to get your thoughts on how you interpret that, what you think the competitive landscapes is going to be looking like over the next little while. And just any interpretation you can offer there. Thanks. ","Shantanu Narayen ","Well, I think we've always talked about how we have been the leaders in creating those categories and how the analytics that we have is without a doubt one of the secret sauces and the biggest competitive advantage that we continue to have. ","Enabling integration between that Analytics as well as our other solutions has been over a five-year effort and we've integrated it. And I think it's just of a reflection that others in the marketplace are understanding that Adobe has a significant competitive advantage with respect to everybody else. But big picture this is an incredibly large opportunity. We're the leader we're going to continue to innovate. We're seeing great customer wins and there will be competition in the space as well as we expect. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer. Your line is open. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks, good evening. One each on Creative Cloud and the digital marketing business. On Creative Cloud when we think about the new product roadmap that you laid out at MAX, and couple that with the creation of a new position with the Scott's joining the company as Chief Product Officer, could you perhaps talk about some of the objectives over the next number of years for Creative Cloud? And what I have in mind specifically is would you think there is any sense to perhaps re-segmenting the product line as you once did with CS and use that as a means to further drive APRU upside? ","Secondly on the marketing cloud, you've spoken in the past of having four dozen or more use cases across multiple industries and as well an objective of eventually having more of a single sign-on or a usage model across all the products. Could you in that score talk about perhaps the momentum across the various verticals or use cases that you're seeing or perhaps talked about?","Shantanu Narayen ","Sure, Jay. I mean first on the Creative Cloud, the success that we've continued to see it's the golden age of creativity and design right now. And when you think about what's happening with Augmented Reality, Virtual reality, artificial intelligence, the kinds of mobile apps that are being created at Adobe. We're just attracting the best. And as you know, we focused tremendously on product Scott is phenomenal at that. And we're just attracting the best in the world to continue to help us push the envelope on being the design and creativity applications. So, thrilled to have him onboard. I would not read into that necessarily anything different with respect to segmenting that. I would definitely read into that that we continue to focus on innovation and making sure that we lead that market the way we've been doing. ","And with respect to your question on the Marketing Cloud, we will continue to demonstrate all of the different use cases. We will continue to focus on vertical industries, we will focus on sort of how people are using this at high level for things like personalization or multichannel engagement with our customers. But from our point of view, the integration associated with these products, every year it gets better. So, the notion of a single sign on that you're talking about and the fact that our customers can think about audience segmentation and demographics, or campaigns, or promotion or content velocity already within this platform, we're so far ahead of where the rest of the market is, but you can correctly continue to expect us to make both the integration better as well as the individual point products better.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana. Your line is open.","Samad Samana","So, I had a question on the company's partner program, it's something that your competitors and enterprise software talk about a lot and I think the companies have been talking a lot more about them as well, I was wondering if you maybe could help us understand how much of Experience Cloud bookings they help you close out and maybe how we could think about that contribution changing in fiscal '18 as you come off of the changes that you put in place in fiscal '17?","Shantanu Narayen ","I think when you look at the partner program, there're multiple dimensions to it but very quickly the first dimension to it certainly is that all of our products when we architect our products just allow developers whether they be individual developers, whether they be enterprises, whether they be system integrators or agencies, to extend our products and so them having their secret sauce to augment our products is a key part of one of our partner strategy. ","With respect to implementation and strategy services, again the traditional SIs and digital agencies are very much part of the ecosystem in terms of both implementation, architecture, services and strategy, and as is probably similar to everybody else in this space when you think about the large deals and the large customers that we have most of these customers have engagement with some partners as well, and so the partner involvement in these accounts will only continue to increase with the strategic nature of this, but everybody has an Adobe practice you'll see at our kickoff that we have, they're very well represented as well as our summit where we have a Partner Day, so we're pleased with the partner interest and we will continue to leverage it because it's in our best interest as well as in the customer's best interest.","Samad Samana","And then maybe Mark if I can just ask a follow-up the guidance for 15% growth in the first quarter for Experience Cloud I believe implies kind of flat revenue from 4Q to 1Q, could you maybe help us think about seasonality for that business and how we should think about the growth cadence across the quarters?","Mark Garrett","I mean we've said that if you model out the business next year it'll follow typical patterns that you saw in 2017 so I think you should expect whether that's total company or even down to the segment level, things following along similar growth patterns to what you saw in '17.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia.","Saket Kalia","Mark perhaps a less exciting question about the business but topical nonetheless, I guess I was just wanted to ask about tax structure and the impact of potential reform, so I guess I understand that a lot of it is still very uncertain, can you just give some broad brushes about how free tax income and tax rates in the U.S. maybe compared to the rest of the world and how you are thinking about potential tax reform for Adobe?","Mark Garrett","Yes, I mean obviously as you said based on the fact that this isn't final yet, I can't comment too much. I'll say we clearly believe that the tax code needs to be overhauled, that its outdated and we clearly are excited about the proposition to really access foreign cash. So, based on what I see this is all very positive for Adobe. It would result we believe in a lower tax rate for us. It would result we believe in our ability to access foreign cash. The good news for Adobe as well is that we have been accruing for a significant percentage of our foreign cash at a 30% tax rate. So, if this passes at a 14% rate on all our foreign cash you wouldn\u2019t see a significant P&L hit, because basically we have already accrued that tax which is great from the Adobe's perspective. So, we will see where it plays out but based on what we see so far, it's very positive from our perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman. Your line is open.","Keith Bachman","I was wondering if you care to make some comments on cash flow for FY '18 and the context of the question is either as our percent of revenue or cash flow growth rates. You mentioned previously and it was in Q4 your days receivable were up. Is there anything you want to call out? Or give us any kind of context for cash flow guidance for CY'18 or FY'18 rather.","Mark Garrett","So, the only significant change to the way we have been executing so far is that as I said DSO is up a little bit because of the two-mobile business just being a different kind of a business from a collections perspective. But outside of that we gave you margin and earnings guidance for next year that will continue to drive good strong cash flow. I did say Q1 there is some seasonality in cash flow because it makes a lot of year end disbursements based on accruals that we make in the fourth quarter, but we are continuing to drive growth in cash flow. That\u2019s about all I can tell you right now. But I fully expect that cash flow will be up again significantly next year.","Keith Bachman","And I'll ask a quick follow up if I could -- your total book business the 6.9 million was up about 18%, so strong growth, but relative to your guidance of revenue growth it's a little less than what the revenue guidance is. How should we think about that number as a proxy going forward in terms of the total book business relative to revenue guidance?","Mark Garrett","So deferred revenue was up 24%, unbilled navy was up less than that year-over-year. But we are pretty pleased with just that total number of 6.4 billion and the growth that that generates going into next year. It\u2019s a little hard to take just that and think about how that compares to revenue growth because it's a little bit apples and oranges not all of the revenue comes off of deferred or unbilled. So, you kind of have to look at them separately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne. Your line is open.","Tom Roderick","This is Tom on for Kirk. So, I was actually wondering about the transition of ETLA contracts to subscription and how that\u2019s impacting your growth in Creative Cloud? And what are your expectations for that transition heading into 2018?","Shantanu Narayen ","Tom on the Creative Cloud side, a lot of those transitions have actually happened and what we are actually seeing and what we focus on even more right now. Two things, one is name user deployment, so ensuring that the adoption of the new Creative Cloud within enterprises is high and second, adoption of services. So, I would say the transition of enterprise customers from buying perpetual to buying Creative Cloud is largely behind us and really the focus is on adoption of all the new products and services that we have and on ensuring that the named account and deployment is going well from their point of view. I would say on the Acrobat side, they\u2019re still probably some install base that exists, but on the Creative Cloud it\u2019s largely behind us.","Tom Roderick","And can you just touch upon your thoughts on opportunities for Document Cloud heading into fiscal year \u201918 and seems like it was picking up momentum in the quarter?","Shantanu Narayen ","We talk about right through the year, how the unit growth is really been driving momentum not just in the Document Cloud, but also since some of that is reflected in the Creative Cloud and its primarily subscriptions, in fact all of the subscriptions and services that we continue to see such as sign and the scan product is driving more PDF adoption. And so, we continue to think that PDF will be a really important format as people move from inefficient paper based processes to electronic processes. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin. Your line is open. ","Taylor Reiners","This is Taylor Reiners on for Alex. I had a follow-up question on the ETLA question. What are the things that we\u2019ve been hearing in a conversation? Is that, you've been having a lot of increased success on renewals moving ETLA customers from point solutions to the entire Creative Cloud portfolio. Just wondering, if you could speak to what aiming you\u2019re at with respect to its expansion dynamics?","Shantanu Narayen ","Well, I think the focus that the field organization has in that particular area is really making sure that people understand that there is a complete offering and we have customer success managers who are in there ensuring that people get the value out of it. That\u2019s a program that\u2019s really been working, we do Adobe Day as we do evangelism. And as design is becoming more prevalent within enterprises, I think adoption of either the individual products or the complete product within enterprises is increasing. ","As with the adoption of the Creative Cloud, we started in North America and now we continue to roll that out. But we think that as we\u2019ve laid out even for individual users moving the core, migrating the core to Creative Cloud and then doing both market expansion and value expansion even with enterprise customers based on the new offerings continues to be headroom for us. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan. Your line is open. ","Shankar Subramanian","This is Shankar on behalf of Kash. Congrats on a great quarter. I have a question on the Marketing Cloud. As you work through the adoption curve and get into the mid-sized businesses, can you talk about the adoption trends for marketing solutions? Do you see customers adopting more client solutions versus more than full speed? And is, how much of that is factored into that fiscal \u201918 kind of support.","Shantanu Narayen ","Well, I will answer the second question first. I mean, we clearly look at everything that\u2019s happening in the marketplace as we think about the guidance that we have because we take it very seriously. But I think I would say in terms of adoption with new customers the multi-solution adoption is primarily the way in which we are going to market, because people see if they're using content management having content management with analytics is really the way to go as well as the audience segmentation part of audience manager. And so, the fact that we have this comprehensive offering from Visitor acquisition to delivery of the content to measurement and monetization, it's really the way we go to market to reflect the depth of our suite and the importance of the platform adoption. ","Shankar Subramanian","Got it. And I think a follow up, on the Microsoft partnership you talked about the 50 logos that you added on. But you also talked about any up selling that you had based on the partnerships with your existing customers. ","Shantanu Narayen ","Well, I think this is still early, but the initial success that we are seeing is really good. And it was just to reflect when you think about whether it\u2019s the dynamics integration with campaign, whether it's what we are doing with Adobe Experience Manager with Azure, what's happening with PowerBI. The people are adopting both solutions and the momentum in the business is strong. ","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Adam Holt. Your line is open. ","Adam Holt","Hey, guys. Thanks so much and congrats on a terrific end to the quarter. I just had two quick ones. One to E-mark [ph]. This is sort of another embarrassment of margin riches and as we look into next year you're looking at 40% margin plus. You are getting into a rare era for software companies. Do you think that this has actually margin upside from 40% or we kind get into the level where you have to reinvest for the growth rates that you all want to achieve?","Mark Garrett","Yeah, obviously we are very fortunate to be able to have in my perspective both significant top-line growth that 20% plus and significant margin growth at scale already. We've done a great job over the years of managing margins. If there is anything we know how to do with Adobe that's it. If there are things that we feel that we need to invest in to drive growth, we will do that. But outside of that, we can deliver margins. So, I'm not going to guide beyond the 40%ish that we talked about for next year. But we make those tradeoffs every month as we go through spending in the company and clearly want to drive growth. ","Adam Holt","And if I can just a quick follow up for Shantanu. When he had talked to Brian Lincoln at our event a couple of weeks ago. He was pretty constructive about the services opportunity and you called it out relative to one of the drivers for the Digital Media cloud. Could you maybe breakdown how do you see that unfolding? What services you're most excited about and how big that can potentially be from a revenue stream? Just order of magnitude not guidance obviously? Thanks so much. ","Shantanu Narayen","Well thanks Adam. And as it relates to services, the one that we're seeing a fair amount of traction and year-over-year had quite significant growth versus Stock as it relates to Creative Cloud as well as sign as it relates to the Document Cloud. And in addition to that, I mean when we think about the Creative Cloud total addressable market, and we think about market expansion in the $5.7 billion I think we had talked about as the 2020 addressable and $7.1 billion for value expansion. ","I think the other thing such as storage collaboration I think is a big opportunity ahead of us. The number of people who do the design within an enterprise as it relates to the number of people who will engage in that collaboration, so I expect to see Adobe do more in that particular space. ","But I think just continuing to afford our customers, the ability to come -- training we've always said is a -- and learning content is something that's an opportunity associated with it, so at the Analyst Meeting, Adam we gave some numbers but hopefully that also gives you some color in terms of the different services that we have.","And since that was the last question, what I wanted to say was as we celebrate our 35th anniversary I know all of us here at Adobe are really proud of the impact that we've had on society and really the continuous innovation that we're delivering across the world by all of our employees. ","It feels the strategy that we have empowering people to create and helping businesses transform is really resonating, they represent large addressable markets with very significant tailwinds, the relentless execution we continue to demonstrate, means that we're pretty unique from a financial perspective in terms of both driving top line and bottom line growth profitably, with significant operating margins. ","We had outstanding financial results in Q4 and FY'17. Our focus in FY'18, continuing to deliver great value to an incredibly diverse set of customers, and so we remain really enthusiastic about the opportunities ahead of us.

In Q3, Adobe delivered another record quarter, with revenue of $1.46 billion; GAAP earnings per share of $0.54; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.75. These strong results are a reflection of our market leadership and momentum we have with Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud, and Adobe Marketing Cloud. We are enabling the world\u2019s leading brands to develop design and data-driven digital experiences for their customers across every channel. Our unique value proposition continues to distance Adobe from our competitors.","In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q3 with $3.7 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, which represents an increase of $285 million quarter-over-quarter. The increase was a result of the continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments.","Creative Cloud is a one-stop shop for creativity and design, offering the world\u2019s best creative apps, services and training, as well as a vibrant marketplace and community. We achieved record Creative revenue of $803 million in Q3, which represents 39% year-over-year growth. Creative ARR grew in line with our expectations and was driven by continued migration of Creative Suite users, the addition of new value to existing subscribers with services such as Adobe Stock, new customer acquisition in the education and hobbyist photography markets, and retention of existing subscribers.","Creative Cloud continues to deliver powerful new innovations across our segments at a rapid pace. As the leader in digital photography, Adobe has set the standard for professional grade photography across cameras and mobile devices with Adobe DNG, a raw file format we created. As of last week\u2019s iOS 10 release, Adobe DNG is now supported natively by iOS and Android, and Lightroom is the first cross platform app to empower users with an end-to-end raw mobile photography workflow for high quality image capture and editing.","New Creative Cloud innovation enables subscribers to design for emerging categories like Experience Design. Adobe XD, our solution for designing and prototyping websites and mobile apps, continues to gain momentum among users and industry watchers. Although still only available as a preview release, last week it was selected as one of 15 winners in the Fast Company Innovation by Design Awards, a distinct honor given the 1,700 entries. Earlier this month, we showcased Adobe\u2019s leadership in the video category, unveiling advancements in virtual reality, character animation, and 3D at the IBC Conference in Amsterdam. These new capabilities are enabling video creators of all kinds from YouTubers to Hollywood studios to create, deliver, monetize, and measure innovative and immersive media across multiple screens.","This morning, we announced the beta release of our new Adobe Stock Contributor Site, which reduces the friction for Creative Cloud users to promote and sell their work. The new site is integrated with Creative Cloud apps and introduces auto-keywording, which uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and tag content, streamlining the submission process, and increasing the discoverability of Adobe Stock content. In November, we will hold our annual MAX Creativity Conference in San Diego. We expect this year\u2019s MAX to be the largest gathering ever of designers, photographers, film makers, and other creative professionals from around the world. As always, we look forward to unveiling new technology at MAX, including whole new categories of cloud-first creative solutions.","The world\u2019s leading digital document service, Document Cloud, leverages PDF and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital, using Acrobat desktop and mobile apps as well as integrated cloud services like Adobe Sign. In Q3, Individual Acrobat subscription units exceeded perpetual units for the first time. And on Adobe.com, over 90% of Acrobat customers chose the subscription offering. Document Cloud revenue was $187 million in Q3. Combined with Acrobat adoption reflected in Creative Cloud, Document Cloud continues to be an important growth business for Adobe.","In June, we announced the Cloud Signature Consortium, a group comprised of leading industry and academic organizations committed to building a new open standard for cloud-based digital signatures across mobile and web, so anyone can digitally sign documents from anywhere. Adobe led the way in establishing PDF as a digital document standard and is now raising the awareness of electronic signatures as a key to any business\u2019 digital transformation.","In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies, and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels. Whether it\u2019s financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment, or automotive, entire industries are experiencing disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger loyalty and growth. Success hinges on a strong foundation of content and data, which enable a deep understanding of customer needs, development, and delivery of consistent, personalized experiences, and the ability to monitor business performance in real time.","In Q3, Adobe managed a record 23 trillion data transactions. Our customers in every major category of business are utilizing our machine learning algorithms to predict customer behavior and drive their business. Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, including Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Media Optimizer are achieving strong growth as our customers invest more in data-driven solutions. In August, Adobe Marketing Cloud once again played a key role in the digital broadcast of the Olympic Games. NBC Sports used Adobe Primetime to power the digital delivery of the 2016 Rio Olympics, the largest digital Olympic Games in history.","In addition to being listed earlier this year as the Marketing Cloud platform category leader, Adobe Marketing Cloud was recognized by industry analysts during the quarter as a leader in categories such as Mobile Application Development, Cross Channel Campaign Management, and Enterprise Marketing Software. We continue to drive new logo wins and expand our business across geographies and vertical markets. Some Q3 customer wins include T-Mobile, Nordstrom, Subaru, SunTrust Bank, AstraZeneca and the state of Tennessee.","At the core of our business are the people that make it happen. As a software business, we know that employees are our most strategic asset and we are committed to increasing diversity. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including coding initiatives focusing on young women. We were recently recognized as one of Forbes\u2019 Most Innovative Companies and we continue to garner best place to work honors around the world, most recently in Australia and India. In addition, our focus as a company on the environment and sustainability is important to our employees and to many investors. We were pleased to learn Adobe has been selected as a component of the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time.","Today, every company is under pressure to be more connected and in tune with its customers, to know their history, their preferences and to create and deliver powerful, personalized experiences to them anywhere they go. Content and data are at the core of these exceptional experiences and Adobe is the only company that brings these critical capabilities together in our market leading cloud solutions. The market opportunity is significant. Our strategy is sound. And our results demonstrate the leverage in our model. All of these are what make us excited about the opportunities ahead. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks Shantanu. In the third quarter of FY \u201816, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.464 billion which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.54 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.75. Strong performance across our three cloud offerings helped to deliver revenue towards the high end of our targeted range. Our cost discipline helped to deliver earnings upside while we continued to invest in the business to drive future growth. Highlights in our third quarter include; Solid growth with Digital Media ARR, We achieved our target of $285 million net new ARR during what is typically a seasonally soft quarter and keeps us on pace to achieve our annual target that we increased earlier this year, Record Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents 39% year-over-year growth, Record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $404 million, which represents 10% year-over-year growth and was above our target for the quarter, Strong growth in operating and net income, Record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue And 83% of Q3 revenue from recurring sources, an all-time high.","In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 29% year-over-year. The addition of $285 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $3.7 billion exiting Q3. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $803 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 39%. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $258 million during Q3 and exited the quarter with $3.26 billion of Creative ARR. Our Creative ARR is more than $1 billion higher than the peak annual Creative revenue we achieved when it was just perpetual licensing of Creative Suite.","Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals. Retention rates for subscriptions overall remained ahead of our original targeted projections. Creative Cloud ARPU across each of our commercial offerings continues to grow quarter-on-quarter as new users on promotion pricing renew at full price after their promotions expire. We also drove strong subscription growth in the education market during the back-to-school season in Q3. Our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in three key areas; growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market, driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue grew by over 40% year-over-year in Q3.","With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $187 million, which was in line with our expectations as we gradually migrate this business to be more recurring. Document Cloud ARR exiting Q3 grew to $442 million, which represents the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Helping this growth is our effort to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future.","In Digital Marketing, we drove strong year-over-year growth in annual Adobe Marketing Cloud subscription bookings and greater than 25% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue. Reported Marketing Cloud revenue was a record $404 million, ahead of our Q3 target as a result of accelerated second half pipeline conversion and resulted in year-over-year growth of 10%. Marketing Cloud retention, bookings in Q3 and our pipeline set us up for a strong Q4. Our increased focus on first year annual subscription value will help us more quickly convert our bookings into reported revenue as we look to FY \u201817 and beyond.","Mobile remains a key market trend for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 52% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $0.9 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY \u201816 versus $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201816, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains was $1.2 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.2 million. We had $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY \u201816 versus $9.1 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY \u201815. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains was $19.4 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. Although there was a short-term impact on demand following the Brexit announcement in the UK, it did not affect our ability to achieve our Q3 goals and we do not anticipate any significant impact through the rest of FY \u201816.","In Q3, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our trade DSO was 45 days, which compares to 44 days in the year ago quarter and 43 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $1.8 billion, up 38% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.45 billion compared to $4.32 billion at the end of Q2. Cash flow from operations was a record $518 million in the quarter. During this year we have been using excess domestic cash to buyback stock and drive our share count down. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.5 million shares at a cost of $344 million. We currently have $800 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015.","Now I will provide our financial outlook. We are targeting a fourth quarter revenue range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to add slightly more than $300 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q4 to achieve our full year target of approximately $4 billion of ARR exiting the year. In Digital Marketing, we expect our business momentum to enable us to achieve Q4 Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 30%, which puts us on pace to achieve our annual growth target of approximately 20% for the year. We are targeting our Q4 share count to be between 503 million to 505 million shares. We expect net non-operating expenses to be between $8 million and $10 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q4 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q4 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.60 to $0.66 per share and a Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.83 to $0.89. For the year, our updated annual targets reflect our year-to-date results and our Q4 targets. We expect FY \u201816 annual revenue between $5.8 billion and $5.85 billion, GAAP EPS between $2.12 and $2.18 and non-GAAP EPS between $2.94 and $3.","In summary, Q3 was yet another strong quarter for Adobe, with the leverage in our model continuing to be reflected in our bottom line performance. Our year-to-date results and targets for Q4 keep us on track to meet or exceed all of the financial targets we provided at the outset of the year. We look forward to finishing the year strong and hope to see you at MAX and our upcoming financial analyst meeting in San Diego. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks Mark.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ross MacMillan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks so much, and congratulations from me. Shantanu, I think Mark commented that the Creative ARR is now about $1 billion higher than the peak in the Creative revenue versus \u2013 or under the Creative Suite licensing model, so you clearly cleared that barrier and you are growing that rapidly. But I actually wondered if you could look at the \u2013 compare and contrast that with the Acrobat and Document Cloud given that, that\u2019s earlier in its cycle of conversion. And I wondered if you could maybe frame for us what the opportunities are there in terms of driving expansion in that opportunity over time and maybe how much larger that could be? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Well, thanks Ross. And while I won\u2019t be updating our TAMs at this point, we are pleased with our performance and I will be happy to give you some color on how we see the opportunity ahead of us in terms of what the Creative Cloud as well as the Document Cloud. The Creative Cloud business is certainly being driven both by customer migration as well as by new customer adoption and we certainly think that\u2019s going to be true for the document business as well. As you know, we have tens of millions of people who have bought Acrobat over the lifetime of the Acrobat product. And for the first time as we mentioned again in our prepared remarks, the number of subscription units of Acrobat actually exceeded the perpetual units. So, we are pleased with how that transition is going. The playbook is exactly the same. It\u2019s about how do we migrate Acrobat customers to Acrobat DC. It\u2019s about adding new services like Sign. It\u2019s about enhancing new services that we can add to the business. But the thing I would also caution folks listening is to recognize that part of the Creative ARR that\u2019s being driven is also already being driven by the document business. And so while we report the document segment separately, let\u2019s already reflect that it\u2019s actually helping not just the document business, but also the creative business. So, we are pleased with that on mobile. PDF has continued to be adopted as a wide standard, which I think also augurs well for its continued growth.","Ross MacMillan","Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up if I could. Mark, great to see the operating leverage coming through, OpEx is growing in the mid-teens, which you think is ahead of headcount growth. So, I wondered if you could just maybe just bridge that for us as we see OpEx growing a little bit ahead of headcount this quarter and probably next quarter? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yes. I mean, in terms \u2013 thanks, Ross. In terms of OpEx growing faster than headcount, I would say a couple of things. Number one, when you hire people during the quarter you don\u2019t get the full effect of their expense in the quarter. They are averaged out over the course of the quarter, so you don\u2019t get the full impact until the following quarter. And as you saw, we did add 500 heads this quarter. There is also a lot of spending that we do that\u2019s non-headcount related, particularly in marketing, and that can come and go despite what we do from a headcount perspective. But let me comment briefly on EPS overall, because I know this will be a follow-on question. We have consistently shown that we have leverage in our model. I think Adobe has been a poster child of that for a number of years now. And with good revenue execution and good cost discipline, I think you have come to expect that from us. When we don\u2019t have very specific short-term investment needs, you are going to see earnings upside like you saw in the back half of this year, both in Q3 and our guidance in Q4. In the longer term, we see a lot of tremendous opportunity that\u2019s going to continue to require investment in sales and marketing. I mean, you saw that in the 500 heads that I mentioned we hired this quarter. So for the longer term, \u201817, \u201818, I would encourage you not to raise your EPS models right now. I would encourage you to recognize that we are going to continue to invest in sales and marketing and wait as we provide \u201817 revenue and earnings guidance later this year.","Ross MacMillan","Understood. Thanks so much and congrats again.","Mark Garrett","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Shantanu, the Marketing Cloud is set to accelerate into the fourth quarter, and I would assume given the perpetual falloff and more moving to the new model that should continue accelerating into fiscal \u201817. Can you just talk a little bit about your confidence underpinning what\u2019s happening in Marketing Cloud as some of your competitors have shown a pretty material slowdown in their growth rates in their cloud, are you taking share? What\u2019s happening here that\u2019s giving you this confidence?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Brent, I think we continue to be the undisputed leader of the Marketing Cloud. It\u2019s a category that we created. And I think from a unique differentiation, what we provide in terms of both the core content and analytics and all of the personalization software that we are delivering, I just \u2013 we continue to execute against that opportunity. I mean, the macro environment, Brent \u2013 I mean, people are still talking about digital disruption and how do they help create more personalized experiences for customers, and we are right in the center of that particular tailwind. With respect to the second half of the year, again, it\u2019s playing out as we expected. We told you at the end of Q2 that we had a strong pipeline, which gave us confidence to grow approximately 20% for the year. We were actually able to close deals on an accelerated basis in Q3, which is why you saw upside to our Q3 numbers relative to the target. And we just have to keep executing the way we are, Brent. It\u2019s not for lack of market opportunity in the marketing space and we just have to keep innovating as well. So, that\u2019s what gives us confidence, the market leadership that we have and continued focus on execution. International expansion, I will again continue to say, is a large opportunity for us in marketing and cross-selling existing customers with new solutions.","Brent Thill","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you could talk about on the creative side, maybe you will update this at MAX, so I will ask another one if you do. But the Creative users that you have talked about in the past that were still to convert, any update on sort of what is left that you have visibility into conversions of the prior CS users still to go on to CC?","Shantanu Narayen","I think big picture Walter, we continue to do a good job of migrating them. As you know, there was a fairly healthy cohort of CS6 customers that continues to be an opportunity for us in the U.S. And we talked about international expansion also as an opportunity. Both Japan and Germany had a good quarter. Now, when we looked at Q3, Japan and Germany grew \u2013 run rate units grew greater than the overall units, so that\u2019s continuing to please us in terms of now seeing CS customers in those geographies migrate. Education had another great subscription units quarter, which means we are attracting that next generation of customers. When you look at overall subs in the quarter, it was a very healthy number, so we are attracting new customers to the platform, but even the migration opportunity continues to be one. I think one of the areas where we are executing well is whether you are an existing customer or whether you are a new customer, the work we are doing in terms of delivering new innovative products, what they are seeing with XD, you will see some new announcements as well at MAX that I am not going to preview here today. What we are doing with VR and video, I think that also gives a lot of people the confidence that by adopting the Creative Cloud, it is the one stop shop for all of their Creative needs. So I think that gives us continued confidence that those who haven\u2019t migrated, they will continue to see additional value as we continue to deliver new innovation.","Walter Pritchard","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Thanks very much and congrats on the quarter guys. Shantanu, I was wondering if you could just talk a little about where you think we are on the Digital Marketing side in terms of customers moving away from buying sort of point products or best of breed products towards buying more Digital Marketing solutions where you guys obviously I think have an advantage just given the breadth of the product portfolio, can you just talk where we are in that transition in your view and how much of an advantage is that today for you all versus some of the competitors, especially some of the smaller ones out there? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Kirk. I think we mentioned that when we think about big picture what\u2019s happening in the enterprise space, if the first era was all about back office automation and the second era was about what happened with productivity or front office, we really are motivated by this notion that it\u2019s going to be the experience business. And if you are trying to create the experience business, the only way to transform your company is by adopting an entire platform rather than piece-meal trying to buy individual products and trying to fit that together. Virtually every new logo that we get is a multi-solution deal because what they want is a complete offering that enables them to do that transformation. Given the breadth of existing customer base, certainly we are up selling all of them to multiple solutions. But whether it\u2019s a new logo acquisition or whether it\u2019s renewals, most of the deals are now multi-solution deals and much larger revenue to Adobe and value to the customer. So hopefully that gives you some color in terms of the number of solutions that they are all adopting and how that\u2019s certainly migrating. To your point, it is a competitive advantage for us most definitely.","Kirk Materne","If I can just ask a really quick follow-up for Mark around that topic Mark, deferred revenue growth has obviously been looking really, really strong, I assume that\u2019s primarily being driven by the strength you have seen in bookings around Digital Marketing, I guess do ETLAs play into that as well I guess from the Creative Cloud side? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Yes. It\u2019s actually both. It\u2019s been driven by Digital Marketing bookings, but it\u2019s also very heavily driven by ETLAs on the Creative side and on the Acrobat side. So it\u2019s really across the board, Kirk.","Kirk Materne","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. But I was wondering, Shantanu or Mark, if you could talk a little bit about \u2013 you mentioned piracy reduction earlier in your prepared remarks and I am wondering if you could share with us how much of a tailwind do you see that giving you, is there kind of a framework that we could think about in terms of the impact on top line growth that you can get from piracy reduction and are there things that you are doing that you are changing even more than you were kind of a couple of years ago to stay ahead of the pirates? Thanks.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Heather. I mean if you look at the macro level and we used to sell approximately 3 million units of Creative Suite a year and if you look at the numbers right now of where we are with Creative Cloud, it\u2019s clear that we have seen significant acceleration. Without a doubt, a large part of that acceleration is people who want Creative Cloud and are no longer pirating Creative products, but are actually as a result of the low price and the value that we are delivering using the entire subscription based offerings. So what we have done from a technical perspective already we have actually ensured that people who download the trials that once the trial expires that they don\u2019t have access to the products. And as you know, we have also shutdown places, online websites where people could buy a repackaged box. So there is no question that we have already addressed piracy in a meaningful way. In terms of the installed base of pirates, I think the numbers for that are all over the map. But I think you can go back and look at the last numbers that we gave in terms of the addressable market and you would see that there is still significant headroom. And the last thing I will mention is I think later this year, we will also make some announcements. There are still a number of countries where we actually only sell CS6 and we are going to start to offer CC in all of those markets. And for the first time we have the ability to offer differential pricing. So this is playing out exactly as we expected. Let\u2019s get the markets that are most developed, let\u2019s address casual pirates, let\u2019s hit the enterprise and then let\u2019s now expand that into emerging markets where there was more piracy and now we have the ability to counter that, both through pricing as well as through technology.","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Weiss","Thank you, guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. What are the things that we were picking up when we were talking to let\u2019s say channel partners was increasing benefit from the roll-off of promotional pricing and good renewal rates on those \u2013 as your promotions roll-off and your comments seem to support that, so I was wondering if you could help us think about that in terms the magnitude of the impact, how much are we seeing that in the numbers today and how much we think about that\u2019s occurring on a go-forward basis and how well is that going to sustain into FY \u201817?","Shantanu Narayen","Certainly some part of that, Keith is reflected in the ARR. When you think about it, Mark may have mentioned in his prepared remarks that when we think about all of the commercial offerings, the ARPU of all of the commercial offerings are increasing. And that, as you point out is a reflection of high retention rates of people who are moving off of promotions. And again, the strategy very much is let\u2019s have promotions to bring people onto our platform. And once we deliver the value as they retain at the annual boundaries, then we get the additional revenue. So it certainly has had an impact on ARR. The same thing is also true in the enterprise. When we first introduced the enterprise offerings, we had what we would call sort of custom enterprise offering, which was more of a mirror of what they were accustomed to buying with the Creative Suite. As they all move off the 3-year cycle and they are renewing, we are definitely marketing to them the value of the entire Creative Cloud offering. And we have seen adoption of that is fairly high again, which again leads to increased revenue per customer.","Keith Weiss","Got it. And if I could perhaps follow-up on that latter comment in terms of the ETLAs to the enterprise market, is there any change in terms of who is able to sell those ETLAs, any expansion of that into the partner channel that we should be aware of?","Shantanu Narayen","For the most part, I would say the large enterprise offerings it\u2019s a direct sales force in our sales force. I think if I look at that also moving forward, we are going to be providing more and more of those as self-serve on adobe.com moving forward. I mean the trend in the industry is clear whether it\u2019s us directly or whether it\u2019s through channel partners in addition to very motivated direct sales force. We want to reduce the friction of procuring, of expanding, of administering the Creative Cloud within enterprises. And we will continue to make that easy for people who just come to our website to start small and then grow as their organization grows. That\u2019s very much of the vision of how we look at adobe.com.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Mark, question for you as it relates to the longer term operating leverage in the business. And clearly you have gotten to a point where I think you mentioned 80% plus of revenues are recurring. And as you have you this recurring revenue business that renews at very high margins, the secondary derivative starts to slow down, although the overall growth still looks pretty good. You don\u2019t have to grow your new subscription revenues quite at the pace that you have been growing before. So therefore that has some positive consequences for acquisition cost and sales and marketing or perhaps are we missing some other consideration in relation to your statement that you continue to see investment opportunities? So, just trying to measure or square off the merits of the subscription model vis-\u00e0-vis your comments that we should be more muted as far as how much margin expansion we should be expecting? Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Yes. Hey, thanks, Kash. I am not saying you should be more muted. I am saying just don\u2019t get a little carried away based on what we are delivering in the second half of this year at all. Yes, we gave you guys a 3-year model a year ago that shows some pretty significant margin expansion over the next several years and we are ahead of that pace in the back half of this year. As I said because when we don\u2019t have some short-term investment needs we can deliver that to you in the form of upside to EPS and deliver that to shareholders. You are right in 83% recurring revenue model, particularly on the creative side, you are going to over time have less cost of acquisition and you can drive more margin. On the Digital Marketing side as we have discussed, that business is a very different business. We have got a lot of variable cost that comes with that business in the form of hosted infrastructure. It\u2019s going to be a very different margin profile. So, we have got two different businesses with two different margin profiles both growing very fast right now. But nothing has changed from our perspective about our ability to continue to drive more margin in the out years.","Shantanu Narayen","And Kash, maybe the one thing I will add is we are clearly seeing the benefits of the stacking effect. When you look at the results for just Q3, I think digital media grew approximately 29%. The Creative grew approximately 39% and certainly the core Creative is growing even faster than that. So very pleased with both new customer acquisition as well as seeing the benefits of the stacking effect in the core subscription revenue stream.","Kash Rangan","Congrats guys. Thank you so much.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks guys. Actually looking for the intersection of two questions that I think were asked earlier was just I think Shantanu, you talked about Creative Suite 6 is still \u2013 the migration path is still there. Later I think you have talked about Germany and Japan having good quarters. But I want to put those two together and try to understand where are you still seeing the most momentum in the Creative Suite conversion by geography?","Shantanu Narayen","I think we continue to see strength across all geographies, Sterling. I think in terms of trying to give some color, Japan and Germany had a good quarter. It was very interesting as Australia where as you know we started the entire process for the Creative Cloud. They had a great new unit growth and run rate and so new customer acquisition is also clearly powering the business. And hopefully those three data points give you \u2013 and Rest of World is growing. It\u2019s just \u2013 we are seeing nice growth across all of the geographies in the run rate business. Clearly, there is more untapped opportunity in terms of international markets than they are in the U.S., no question, because in the U.S., we have seen tremendous progress. But I don\u2019t want to give anybody the impression that in the U.S., we are not both growing new customers as well as migrating existing customers.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks. For Mark, would it be fair to say that your pace of hiring could very well accelerate in terms of total heads even as compared \u2013 or especially as compared with Q3 adds? When looking, for example, at the number of open positions, right now on in your website we detected a pretty sharp increase year-over-year and sequentially over the past few months in all major regions, Americas, Asia, EMEA, sales and R&D spiking up pretty considerably. And interestingly, Japan is picking up in terms of opening U.K. post-Brexit, picking up in terms of openings. So, again, would it be fair to say that do you think you might even drive the headcount additions, particularly in non-U.S. markets more rapidly?","Mark Garrett","Hey, Jay. Yes, without a doubt, the 500 people we added roughly this quarter is the most we have added in a quarter in my recent memory and it\u2019s all being driven by what we have been seeing for quite a while, which is our need to drive sales capacity for both Digital Media and Digital Marketing, drive more marketing and R&D as well for that matter. So, I would expect that to continue and that\u2019s why I made the comment I did about our investment for the next couple of years. We are going to need to make sure we have got the right available funds to invest in that and drive the growth that we are trying to driving these businesses. We are driving 20% revenue growth on the Digital Media side of the business and 30% bookings growth on the Digital Marketing side. Those are pretty significant growth numbers and you have got to have the investment to drive that growth.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Right. For Shantanu, you have spoken at Summit and on other occasions Mark has as well, about your future technology infrastructure meaning you have referred on a number of occasions to defining a common data model, common cloud architecture, investments in data science and so forth. Could you talk about that a little bit in terms of ultimately where do you see the platform going? Is that part of what you were referring to earlier in terms of a frictionless self-service capability that you could offer customers? What do those really mean in terms of functionality and deliverables to the customer?","Shantanu Narayen","Well, Jay, I think in terms of how we as a product company continue to innovate for our customers, there is no question that Creative Cloud has been as successful as it is, because not only is it best-of-breed individual products for specific users, but the integration across all of those is unparalleled in the industry in terms of how colors or types of fonts work. Our vision for the Marketing Cloud is exactly the same, which is we are building a data platform that enables all of our products to work seamlessly together. We have made a lot of progress in that space. And the benefit for customers is certainly as they think about a campaign, as they think about customer segments it naturally flows from the analytics product to the target product to the campaign product. And in the enterprise space, we certainly see that our Marketing Cloud, while it\u2019s a leader, we have aspirations for that not to be an island unto itself, but really to be the hub that interconnects all of the enterprise software. And so investing as you point out in these core data platforms to enable our customers to derive value and for us to continue to build a technology moat that will serve us well for many years is very much part of the strategy. And last but not least, customer expectations right now across the globe are that content flows seamlessly from our Creative Cloud into our Marketing Cloud and so we do that. The one other comment I will make you are right, there is a lot of conversation right now about machine learning and AI. It\u2019s something that we have invested in for years. I mean, we wouldn\u2019t be building the magic that we build in Creative Cloud or Creative Suite without very deep technology in terms of machine learning. And the reality is when we think about Marketing Cloud, it\u2019s not about data collection, it\u2019s all about how we are driving insight and predictive, which is another form of machine learning and that\u2019s what\u2019s really fueled our Marketing Cloud business. So continue to invest in deep technology across the company.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Alex Zukin","Thanks for taking my question guys. Shantanu, you mentioned some accelerated deal signings in the quarter. And I guess maybe you can comment on the macro backdrop as you are seeing this year versus last year as some of the other vendors in the space saw some deal pushes and you clearly aren\u2019t seeing that. So maybe just give a comment there and then I have got a quick follow-up.","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, Alex, I think when, after Q2, we said as we looked at the pipeline for the second half of the year, it was a healthy pipeline. And we look at it and we have our internal expectations of what\u2019s going to close in Q3 and what\u2019s going to close in Q4. As you know, enterprise software Q4 is the traditionally strong quarter, which again to the question that Brent also asked earlier gives us confidence the strength of the pipeline for the numbers that we said. But I think we executed well against it. And I think it also reflects the importance of our solutions for the customers that we are serving. I mean if you are trying to move your business online, if you are trying to create a more personalized relationship with your customers sure, you can defer the decision. You are only deferring the inevitable in terms of having to invest in technology that helps you automate that process. And so I would say part of it is the offering that we have, part of it is execution that we have. And we have to just continue to be focused on it.","Mike Saviage","Operator \u2013 sorry Alex, go ahead.","Alex Zukin","Yes. I was going to ask a question, you mentioned machine learning and predictive analytics and Shantanu I guess \u2013 and kind of in the context of AI, do you see \u2013 when you think about the application of data within your product suite, are you thinking more in terms of automation context or insights context, just in general how do you see that playing out in the marketing landscape over the next few years?","Shantanu Narayen","I think Alex, for years we have been talking about our platform unique advantage being the combination of data and content. And as we are enabling our customers to have these Marketing Clouds deliver more personalized experience, I think table stakes a few years ago was being to actually just collect that data to the core Web Analytics. Our business is being fueled by not just collecting the data. Our business is certainly being fueled by across campaign and across target. How are we providing a unique insight into our customers, so we have been doing this for years and I think to your point, there are a lot of people talking about it. It\u2019s going to become something that becomes the industry buzz. We have partly been executed against that for quite a while now.","Mike Saviage","Operator, we are coming up at the top of the hour, why don\u2019t we take one more question?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question is from Derrick Wood from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Derrick Wood","Great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Shantanu, on the Marketing Cloud, based on our conversations, at least within the enterprise B2C base, it seems like we are moving a bit past the website re-platforming cycle and a bit more towards adding modules on top of AEM and better monetizing the content in the platform, would you agree with this and if so, what does that mean to the kind of the velocity of transaction activity and the type of deal sizes you are seeing. And then maybe correlated but Mark, I think I heard you say you want to increase both more focused on first year contract value and shorten time to go live, could you just flush out a bit more about what you guys are doing and what you hope to yield from it?","Mark Garrett","Yes. I will start and then Shantanu can add on. So as it relates to that. I think we have discussed this with you. I know we have discussed this with you in the past, but we want to more closely align revenue to bookings. And as a result to that, our focus has shifted more towards annual subscription value. So the field \u2013 our sales force is now compensated more towards annual subscription value. We continue to believe that we are going to hit our 30% ASP bookings growth for the year. And by doing so, that puts revenue more closely aligned to bookings.","Shantanu Narayen","And Derrick, as to your question, you are absolutely right. I mean the single point of interaction in the digital world for most customers used to be the website with AEM as you pointed out. What\u2019s becoming table stakes increasingly is having that same kind of personalized experience across all digital channels, whether you are in airlines and that\u2019s the experience in the kiosk or a terminal, whether it\u2019s in retail and that\u2019s the particular experience when you walk into a retail store, whether it\u2019s in food and functionality, whether it you are coming to a drive-in. And so what\u2019s fueling our business is the ability to actually deliver that same experience across each of those different channels. And more specifically, what that means is as people are creating new mobile applications and using our AEM mobile solutions or as people are corresponding more with people and addressing our campaign solutions. And it\u2019s certainly our goal to provide that single stop shop for all communication and all experience across all different channels. It\u2019s very definitely driving it. The one product that I will again single out is Audience Manager really just continues to do extremely well in the enterprise. And I think the reason for that is all enterprises are starting off with this question who are my customers, what are the demographics and how do I set up that up. And Audience Manager is so much more than just DMV. It actually allows enterprise to start off in a business strategy and say, let me get as real clear understanding of my customers and what I am trying to deliver to them across all different touch points. So our vision of the Marketing Cloud and continuing to be the one stop shop, I think it\u2019s paying off and you are seeing that in the results. And big picture, since that was the last question, I think we continue to focus on the large opportunities ahead of us as a company. And we are helping create the world\u2019s content. We are helping enterprises use technology to deliver better customer value. I know Mark and I are pleased with our Q3 results. Our Q4 targets reflect the continued momentum in the business. It\u2019s going to be able to enlist macro environment, continue to reiterate our financial targets. And as you saw, increase our EPS target for the year. And so we think we are in great shape. We remain focused on driving innovation for our customers. I again want to thank customers, partners worldwide for their commitment and to our employers \u2013 employees for continuing to drive innovation in this industry. We look forward to seeing you all at MAX. There are going to be some exciting announcements and we will have an update for you, but thank you for joining us today.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call.

I would like to welcome you to the Adobe Systems Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Mike Saviage, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike Saviage","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call are Adobe\u2019s President and CEO, Shantanu Narayen and Mark Garrett, Executive Vice President and CFO.","In the call today, we will discuss Adobe\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2016 financial results. By now, you should have a copy of our earnings press release, which crossed the wire approximately 1 hour ago. We have also posted PDFs of our earnings call prepared remarks and slides, financial targets and an updated investor data sheet on adobe.com.

The call audio and the webcast archive may not be rerecorded or otherwise reproduced or distributed without prior written permission from Adobe.","I will now turn the call over to Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. In Q2, Adobe delivered another record quarter, reporting revenue of $1.4 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $0.48 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.71. Our momentum is a result of the continuous delivery of breakthrough product innovation across each of our three cloud offerings. We advanced our strategy of enabling the world\u2019s biggest brands, governments and educational institutions to develop well-designed, data-led and personalized digital experiences to their customers across every channel.","In our Digital Media segment, we exited Q2 with $3.41 billion of annualized recurring revenue, a net increase of $285 million. We exceeded our ARR target as a result of continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creators from inspiration to monetization. Q2 ARR performance was driven by strong demand across all offerings, routes to market and geographies. We continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments and adding value by introducing new services. In addition to continued strength on Adobe.com, we were particularly pleased with the strength of renewals of enterprise term license agreements, which drove an increase in enterprise ARPU. Creative Cloud innovation continues at a torrid pace. Our goal is to make the creative process more fun, seamless and efficient for creatives, enabling them to go from a blank page to a brilliant composition in record time.","We announced a major Creative Cloud update today that includes new features in flagship applications like Content-Aware Crop in Photoshop, performance enhancements in cross-product capabilities like CreativeSync and a significant update to Adobe Stock, which now includes a premium collection of stock content and deeper integration within the CC desktop and mobile applications. We believe this innovation will promote migration and enhance retention. We continue to introduce new applications to target new design categories. Adobe XD, our solution for user interface design, has already garnered more than 200,000 downloads as a preview release. In addition to delivering cutting-edge innovation for use by professionals, we are excited about the broader opportunity to enable anybody with an idea to create and share high-impact visual stories. Adobe Spark was introduced in May to address this need, and enables students and consumers to create professional quality, social posts, web stories and animated video in minutes.","Adobe Document Cloud, the leading digital document service, enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes into 100% digital workflows. Net new Document Cloud ARR grew quarter-over-quarter, demonstrating the continued momentum of this business. Document Cloud revenue was $188 million in Q2, and we exited the quarter with $415 million of Document Cloud ARR. Cross-cloud integration remains a high priority for Adobe. In April, we announced the first integration between Adobe Sign and Adobe Experience Manager, eliminating the cost and frustration of manual paper-based processes for enrollment, on-boarding and servicing across the customer journey. We announced new Document Cloud storage integrations with Box and Microsoft OneDrive to seamlessly and securely connect workflows across enterprise content collaboration platforms.","In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud remains the leader in the emerging high growth customer experience category. Through our unique combination of content and data, Adobe Marketing Cloud enables businesses to deliver highly personalized digital experiences across devices and digital channels. Adobe Marketing Cloud customer retention remains high and we continue to drive adoption of multiple solutions by our customers. Q2 customer wins include Southwest Airlines, eBay, the NFL, FedEx, American Red Cross, Logitech and Singapore Workforce Development Agency.","In Q2, we had record attendance at Adobe Summit events in Las Vegas and London as well as Symposia in Mumbai and New York. We unveiled the next generation Adobe Marketing Cloud, shared our Adobe Cloud platform roadmap and announced the Adobe Marketing Cloud Device Co-op, a network that will enable the world\u2019s biggest brands to work together to better identify consumers across digital devices. A key takeaway from these customer events was the strong growth of partners and developers who are building vertical applications on our platform.","In March, we announced Adobe Primetime over-the-top capabilities that make it easy for TV networks and pay-TV providers to bring more personalized TV and ad experiences directly to consumers via Apple TV, Microsoft Xbox, Roku and other connected devices. In May, we introduced expanded virtual reality and augmented reality capabilities within Adobe Primetime, with ad insertion, digital rights management and playback.","In May, we acquired Livefyre, a social content curation company. Livefyre will continue to be available as a standalone service and will be integrated within Adobe Experience Manager. With this integration, customers will be able to collect, curate and publish user-generated content from major social networks into digital experiences across their own marketing channels. Based on these announcements, innovation and momentum, industry analysts continue to recognize Adobe\u2019s Marketing Cloud solutions as market leaders in their respective categories.","In Q2, Adobe\u2019s Campaign solution was named the leader by both Gartner and Forrester Research in their 2016 Magic Quadrant for Multichannel Campaign Management and the 2016 Cross-Channel Campaign Management Wave reports, respectively. Last week, Gartner named Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms report. Finally, Forrester Research recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2016 Enterprise Marketing Software Suites Wave report, where we once again received the highest scores for our overall Adobe Marketing Cloud offering and strategy.","In Q2, Adobe Marketing Cloud managed nearly 19 trillion customer data transactions for our customers, reinforcing Adobe as the leading big data company in digital marketing. With unique insights from this data, we launched our new Digital Economy Project in March, which has quickly garnered broad attention as a critical indicator for the U.S. digital economy. The monthly report includes a digital price index, a housing index and a job seeking index.","Dealing with digital disruption is the main concern we hear about in every meeting we have with business, education and government leaders the world over. A key strategy for dealing with this disruption is to deliver a compelling digital experience, which is the new basis for customer satisfaction, loyalty and growth. This business imperative creates great opportunity for Adobe. We are the only company that helps with every stage of a digital experience from creation through monetization.","With another strong quarter behind us, we continue to be bullish about our growth prospects. Mark?","Mark Garrett","Thanks Shantanu. In the second quarter of FY \u201816, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.399 billion, which represents 20% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 were $0.48 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.71. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our targeted range, GAAP earnings were at the high end of our targeted range and non-GAAP earnings were above our targeted range. These strong results reflect continued momentum across our business.","Highlights in our second quarter include; strong growth in Digital Media ARR, which reflects the overall health of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses, record Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents 37% year-over-year growth, record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, which represents 18% year-over-year growth, strong growth in operating and net income, with cash flow from operations of $489 million and 81% of Q2 revenue was from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 26% year-over-year. More importantly, we exceeded our Q2 target for Digital Media ARR. We added $285 million during the quarter and exited Q2 with $3.41 billion. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $755 million, which represents year-over-year growth of 37%. We increased Creative ARR by $263 million during Q2. Driving this momentum was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions. Retention rates remain consistent with prior periods.","We continue to execute well against our key Creative Cloud opportunities growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users and growing our installed base in the education market, driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as the Photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to drive new member adoption and achieving higher ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock, where revenue has grown sequentially over each of the past three quarters. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $188 million, which was in line with our expectations. In addition, Document Cloud ARR exiting Q2 grew to $415 million, which represents higher quarter-over-quarter growth when compared to Q1. We continued to drive adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, which is benefiting ARR and building a foundation for growth in the future.","In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $385 million, driven by multi-solution adoption. We achieved another strong quarter with Adobe Campaign and Adobe Audience Manager is becoming a strategic asset as our customers are increasingly utilizing data to enhance their Digital Marketing programs to deliver personalized, engaging experiences. In Q2, for the first time, mobile transactions grew to 50% of total Adobe Analytics transactions.","From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX increased revenue by $5.2 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201816 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY \u201816, thus the net sequential currency increase to revenue, considering hedging gains was $5.6 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $21.7 million. We had $3.6 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201816 versus $22.2 million in hedge gains in Q2 FY \u201815, thus the net year-over-year currency decrease to revenue, considering hedging gains was $40.3 million.","In Q2, Adobe\u2019s effective tax rate was 26% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP tax rate was higher than expected primarily due to the acquisition of Livefyre. Our trade DSO was 43 days, which compares to 39 days in the year ago quarter and 42 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $489 million in the quarter. Deferred revenue grew to $1.68 billion, up 37% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.32 billion compared to $4.1 billion at the end of Q1. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $205 million. We currently have $1.2 billion remaining under our current authority granted January 2015.","I will now provide our financial outlook. Based on our strong first half performance and business momentum, we expect to meet or exceed our FY \u201816 annual targets, which we raised in March. We expect the second half of the year to play out as we outlined in our Q1 call. We are targeting a third quarter revenue range of $1.420 billion to $1.470 billion. In Digital Media, we expect to add approximately $285 million of net new Digital Media ARR during Q3, with strong year-over-year Digital Media segment revenue growth. In Digital Marketing, we expect continued momentum in bookings and approximately 7% year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth in Q3, factoring in the strong perpetual revenue in the year ago quarter.","We are targeting our Q3 share count to be between 504 million to 506 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be between $11 million and $13 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q3 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q3 GAAP earnings per share range of $0.46 to $0.52 per share and a Q3 non-GAAP earnings per share range of $0.69 to $0.75. In summary, Q2 was another solid quarter for Adobe and we look forward to our momentum continuing in the second half of fiscal 2016. Mike?","Mike Saviage","Thanks Mark.

Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Kirk Materne","Hi, thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Mark, I had a question just on the guidance around the Digital Marketing business. I realized that there has been some, I guess, changes in sort of how the rev rec has been going given the shift from perpetual to more subscription-based rev rec. But this next quarter, even when you adjust for some of that deal that fell into 3Q last year, which I understand is quite a little bit of a tougher comp. It seems like that gap between bookings in that segment and sort of revenue growth still isn\u2019t closing perhaps as fast as one might be thinking. So, can you just walk through that if there is changes in terms of implementation times are taking longer so there is some issue there or if you have longer deals that are \u2013 can span over say six quarters versus four. I was just kind of getting \u2013 I just want to get a sense on when do we start to see the inflection in the revenue growth in that business come back in the line a little bit closer with the bookings trends? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","Hey, Kirk. Yes, thanks. So, as you pointed out in Q3 of last year, we did have an unusual amount of perpetual revenue. In fact, if you normalized last year for that perpetual revenue that was kind of above and beyond, the growth this year would have been somewhere in the 20% area. So, that is the reason why you are seeing 7% instead of what would have normally been something like 20%. We are still on a path to do 20% for the year, which is what we guided to quite a while ago. So, there is no change. There is no change in implementations or any of the other factors that you mentioned. It\u2019s really just how the quarters play out relative to perpetual last year.","Kirk Materne","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Mark, just following up on Kirk\u2019s question. Can you just confirm that you are still, on the bookings side, I think catch what you did in Q2 in the Marketing Cloud? Can you give us a sense of what the gross booking number was in Q2?","Mark Garrett","Yes. So, we don\u2019t disclose the booking number, Brent, every single quarter. But what we have said is that we are driving towards 30%. We are driving both long-term total contract value and we are focusing more and more now on annual contract value and we expect that to grow 30% this year, which is consistent with what we have been saying.","Brent Thill","Okay. So, no change in the background other than the [OpEx] [ph], the perpetual...","Mark Garrett","Yes, that\u2019s right. And as we are pointing out, we are still saying we are going to grow 20% revenue this year. It just doesn\u2019t make for a bigger Q4, but you are also getting now the stacking effect of those bookings that will start to play out in Q4.","Shantanu Narayen","And two things both Brent and Kirk, if you look at our numbers for last year it actually does have traditional and seasonal expectation to it, so Q3 and Q4. And when we gave our updated targets at the end of Q2, this was very much part of the plan. So, it\u2019s playing out exactly as we had expected.","Brent Thill","Shantanu, just a quick follow-up on the Creative Cloud. Where do you see the biggest next lever of growth? Is this coming to international? Is it a new user type? [Indiscernible], it seems like it\u2019s doing well. What\u2019s the next big wave you see that you have yet to hit?","Shantanu Narayen","Well Brent, firstly with respect to Q2, we exceeded our ARR target that we had specified. We had expected $275 million. We came in at $285 million. And if you normalize for the 14-week quarter in Q1, you will actually see it was extremely strong performance. From the point of view of color, we said that we actually saw strength across all of the offerings as well as all of the geographies. And I think I highlighted in particular, as the 3-year ETLAs are now all coming up for renewal, the first time around, we had actually done a lot of the ETLAs as sort of custom deals. Now, we are seeing services as part of it. So, the enterprise continues to be an opportunity. International, to your point, also continues to be an opportunity. We have always highlighted Japan and Germany, which are continuing to show progress against the migration goals that we have as well as new customer acquisition. Education also continues to be an area where we are seeing interest in the Creative Suite. And I think if you see some of the announcements we made today, whether it was the new product in XD, adding virtual reality to premiere, things that we are doing with touch, there is just so much innovation possible. I think the core elements of migrating existing customers, adding new customers and adding new services, we continue to be excited about the opportunity ahead of us. And it\u2019s actually pretty interesting that 3 years into the transition, we expect record net ARR add in 2016. I think by all accounts, that\u2019s great performance.","Brent Thill","Thanks, Shantanu.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I know that you are no longer disclosing the sub numbers around Creative Cloud, but triangulating some of the commentary on ETLA renewals, increase in ARPU might have some people wondering qualitatively, was there any softness in terms of the net increase in Creative Cloud subs in the quarter?","Shantanu Narayen","Sterling, we were expecting multiple people would ask us that. We had a great quarter in subs, but ARR continues to be where we are focusing. No issues there whatsoever. Great quarter.","Sterling Auty","Alright, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Thanks a lot. Hey, Mark. Just wanted to drill in on Digital Marketing. In Q1, the Digital Marketing subscription revenue grew 25% and we get that in the filing. I wondered if you had that subscription revenue growth in 2Q. And in context of that, when you talk about 20% overall growth, what will that subscription revenue kind of grow at ballpark for the year do you think? Thanks.","Mark Garrett","So, let me answer that a slightly different way and I may have to get a little bit more detail for you later, Ross. But in Q1, the subscription revenue that you see that was reported had an extra week. And that week, we said on our Q1 earnings call was worth $75 million in total revenue, but the bulk of that is subscription-oriented. So, again in Q1, we had that extra week, we talked about of revenue which was worth $75 million. The bulk of that is going to be subscription-oriented revenue. So, when you look at sequentially the subscription revenue that we report from Q1 to Q2, it\u2019s definitely muted by the fact that you had an extra week in Q1. So, there is really strong growth in subscription revenue in Q2.","Shantanu Narayen","The other thing, Ross, I would just add is as expected, the amount of perpetual revenue that we are seeing in the Digital Marketing business is decreasing and becoming immaterial. So, I think the health of the business is driven by bookings and converting the bookings to revenue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan","Hey, thanks and congratulations on still continuing to be the gold standard for these model transitions. One clarification for you, Mark is so when you look at the Creative revenue number, Q1 was significantly better than expected. How much of the Creative revenue performance itself this quarter is more so than normalization, because you do not have that extra week and therefore you are forecasting a number that \u2013 or guiding to a number that\u2019s closer to where you landed vis-\u00e0-vis any changes in the linearity or trends of the business itself this quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the previous quarter? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.","Mark Garrett","Yes, Kash, it\u2019s really driven by the extra week. Like I said, $75 million in Q1 came from that extra week. That $75 million is driven by subscription revenue, which would be both Digital Media and Digital Marketing. There is no change to the core underlying businesses. It\u2019s really just driven by that extra week.","Kash Rangan","Got it. So, with respect to Street numbers, which may have \u2013 your guidance certainly is a little \u2013 at the lower end of your range is a little bit below, considering that you are very conservative, it\u2019s a little bit below the Street expectations, is that primarily due to the Digital Marketing Cloud site, where you correctly pointed out that you have a tough comparison to the perpetual induced Q3, is that all there is to it with respect to how your guidance shakes out relative to the rest of the Street or are there other pieces to the guidance that explains the discrepancy versus at least where our models were? And that\u2019s it for me. Thank you again.","Mark Garrett","As Shantanu and I have both said, we expect to meet or exceed all of our FY \u201816 targets, and these are targets that we have raised after Q1. We didn\u2019t give specific Q3 and Q4 targets. But what we are laying out now for the rest of the year is very consistent with the quarterly color we provided. And it\u2019s also very similar to what you saw last year in terms of seasonality. There is still seasonality as it relates to revenue in Q3, Q4. So I think what you are seeing from us is exactly what we would have expected, exactly consistent with what we have been saying all year long. And it\u2019s probably just driven by the fact that we didn\u2019t give specific targets in Q3 and Q4.","Shantanu Narayen","The other thing, Kash\u2026","Kash Rangan","Actually, you did point a deceleration on the March quarter call in Digital Marketing upcoming in Q3, so you did give us a bit of a heads-up?","Mark Garrett","Yes.","Shantanu Narayen","Kash, the other thing that\u2019s really happening is from our point of view, Mark and mine, I mean and the quarters are playing out exactly as expected. And when you see the percentage of revenue right now that\u2019s recurring, when you look at it relative to the midpoint of what we specified in Q2, it was an outstanding quarter from our point of view. And our ability to predict the revenue is actually getting better and better. And so I think when you look at some of the ranges that used to be the traditional part of our business when the amount of perpetual was different, the good news from our point of view is the business is actually becoming more predictable and we have more visibility. So it\u2019s playing out like we have thought.","Kash Rangan","Congrats.","Mark Garrett","Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is open.","Walter Pritchard","Hi. Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you can talk about larger M&A and how that sort of bolsters [ph] your strategy here as you are looking at growth in the Digital Marketing space and how willing you are to step up to do a large deal and what that deal might look like if you were looking to step up and do something more than $1 billion?","Shantanu Narayen","Walter I mean I think from our point of view, when we look at the overall opportunity, we have estimated it as approximately $27 billion. And we don\u2019t think any single adjacency is going to impact our ability to either differentiate or continue to lead the market. I mean we have very established criteria. We look at strategic expansion, we look at cultural fit and we look at healthy financial returns. And if something meets those criteria, we will engage. If something doesn\u2019t, we will continue to focus on our organic growth opportunities, which are outstanding. The second thing I would say is that specifically as it relates to our focus, as we are delivering the platform more and more of this actually represents a partner ecosystem. And I would suspect that commerce is on some people\u2019s minds relative to what our strategy is. And we continue to partner with multiple companies, whether it\u2019s IBM, SAP or Demandware, because we control the entire digital experience. And we partner with them, with Demandware, on the specific retail vertical as well as physical goods. And if you think about the much larger opportunity that exists there, it\u2019s around non-physical commerce and we have partnerships there as well. So net, I would say we feel really good about our organic growth prospects and we will continue to be disciplined about looking at potential adjacencies.","Walter Pritchard","Okay. Thank you, Shantanu.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Weiss","Thank you, guys for taking the question and nice quarter. I guess in terms of the overall macro, one of the things that we picked up today and our test was a potential for some pause in spending, particularly in the UK, I mean more broadly in Western Europe ahead of the Brexit vote, did you see any of that in your quarter at all, any indication that guys are just maybe pausing ahead of that that a period of uncertainty and was there any of that reflected in your guidance, any of that uncertainty?","Shantanu Narayen","No Keith, we neither saw any weakness nor do we think that there is any impact to the macroeconomic opportunity that we have in those countries. As I said, there isn\u2019t a customer on the planet that we go visit where digital disruption is not top of mind, it\u2019s a line item in everybody\u2019s budget and they are all talking about how they are going to aggressively transition to digital experiences. So our conversation with them is front and center.","Keith Weiss","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. I actually had two questions, the first one was related to Adobe Stock and now that that deal has been closed for about a year and a half, just wondering if you could share with us how your strategy with that has been evolving and any stats if you can share with us about that driving incremental ARR. And then the second question Mark, is you guys have been exceptional in terms of your operating expense control and if we do however, look at the \u2013 look at what you are forecasting or what\u2019s implied in your forecast for the back half of the year, there is a pretty material ramp that you are baking in, I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of what those incremental investments might be? Thank you.","Shantanu Narayen","I will take the first Heather, with respect to Adobe Stock. I think the big picture opportunity has always been that the people who both contribute to the Stock ecosystem and the people who use Stock in order to create their compositions both are Adobe customers. I think when you look at the number of people who are using Adobe Stock, the percentage of them who represent \u2013 who are CC subscribers is a very high percentage. So clearly, we are targeting folks who are already have a strong affinity towards our products strategically and view this as a value added service. With respect to how we are going to market Heather, we have offerings that allow people who have a CC subscription to add a Stock subscription to that. And we also offer a complete offering, which includes both access to CC desktop applications as well as Stock. And we are seeing uptake in both of those categories in addition to the traditional on-demand business that existed in Stock. And when I look at the revenue numbers over the last three quarters, we have been seeing good growth in the Adobe Stock line item across all three quarters. So it\u2019s leading to both revenue as well as ARPU and ARR.","Mark Garrett","And Heather, as it relates to OpEx, I know this has been a question on analysts\u2019 minds for a while. We do have enough OpEx in our model, whether it\u2019s this year\u2019s model or the 3-year model that we have provided to make sure that we can grow the business the way we want to grow the business. And that growth is going to require sales capacity in Digital Marketing and it\u2019s going to require marketing activities in Digital Media. And of course, we are going to constantly invest in R&D. That\u2019s where it goes. To the extent that in any given quarter, we don\u2019t need it and we don\u2019t have a responsible place to put it, we are going to give it back to shareholders. And that\u2019s what you have seen from us in the last couple of quarters. And you know over many, many years that when we control costs and don\u2019t have a short-term need to make those investments, we will provide it back to you in the form of upside to EPS.","Heather Bellini","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you very much. Can you give us some more color on the Document Cloud transition to subscription, how that\u2019s progressing, when and if we could see a bigger inflection, how we should think about the whole process going forward?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes. Mark, we had a strong quarter in the Document Cloud. And as you know, a significant portion of what we are seeing even with the Creative customers is adoption of the new Acrobat. Adobe Sign also continues to do well, that\u2019s represented in the Document Cloud business. So if I look at it quarter-over-quarter, that business continues to show momentum. We think there is a significant opportunity ahead of us. We have stated in the past that we have over 30 million people who have bought the perpetual or traditional version of Acrobat that represents opportunities and that the migration to subscription will be more muted overall than the Creative business. But on Adobe.com, we are actually seeing mostly adoption of the subscription version of the Document Cloud. So pleased with the business and continue to think that, that\u2019s a growth opportunity for us.","Mark Moerdler","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Steve Ashley","Well, I was going to ask a Document Cloud question as well and specifically Document Cloud has allowed you to augment and change your go-to-market strategy? And are you trying to also push adoption within larger Creative accounts with the Document Cloud?","Shantanu Narayen","Steve, you broke up a little bit. But if the question was around what we are doing with respect to cross-selling each of our clouds into enterprise customers, yes, we are seeing significant progress with that, specifically, I would say in three areas. The first area is in what we have done with mobile and combining the DPS offering with AEM mobile and now providing a one-stop shop for whether they were Creative customers or Digital Marketing customers with our mobile publishing suite. The second area is in the cross-integration between Adobe Sign as well as AEM forms thereby allowing people to automate their inefficient paper-based processes. And the third area of cross-cloud integration and selling that we are doing is in the Creative Cloud enterprise offering, where people both have access to all of the Creative Cloud desktop applications as well as asset management through our Digital Marketing solutions to improve their content velocity. So, those are the three areas where we are continuing to both see traction from our customers, cross-sell into those specific accounts and continue with innovation on an integration.","Steve Ashley","Perfect. Thank you, Shant.","Shantanu Narayen","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Got it. Thanks. Good evening. Shantanu, at Summit 3 months ago and again today on the call, you highlighted AudienceManager among your Marketing Cloud solutions. And I am wondering if you are anticipating a significant re-ranking, let\u2019s say, of the various solutions that comprise total Marketing Cloud revenues. Could AudienceManager in effect become the next AEM as a major driver to growth of total Marketing Cloud? Also at Summit, you have said almost in passing during the investor meeting that you were experimenting with a new kind of licensing or usage model. If you have any update on that? And just a quick follow-up for Mark.","Shantanu Narayen","Sure, Jay. I think both of those relate to the big picture question of how are we making progress of migrating from individual solutions to customers adopting our entire Digital Marketing platform. I think the big three as it relates to solution revenue continue to be the Adobe Analytics, the Adobe Experience Manager as well as the Adobe Campaign solutions. But I think what\u2019s really exciting about Adobe AudienceManager is that it\u2019s one of the core services that\u2019s helping integrate all of these other three products into a more meaningful offering to marketers and Chief Revenue and Chief Digital Officers. And the traction that we are seeing with that I think reflects the growing trend in the industry, where people don\u2019t want to buy individual solutions, but they want to buy an entire platform that they can deploy and see the benefit of it easily. So, I think that\u2019s the reason to highlight the success that we are seeing with AudienceManager as a core service. And with respect to your second question, I mean, we are continuing to clearly see that the multi-product solutions are being adopted and that will continue to be our focus and delivery.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","So Mark, you say you don\u2019t have the record revenue for services. We have talked about this subject in the last couple of quarters. On the other hand, your margins improved in services sequentially and year-over-year. So, the question is do you think you can keep the services margin stable or perhaps on some upward path as we saw in Q2? And is the services growth driven by both Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud or one more than the other?","Mark Garrett","No, the services growth is really driven by Marketing Cloud. As we do larger engagements with customers, as we deploy multiple solutions within customers, they want us to help them get the ROI out of that purchase and they are coming to us for implementation help. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving the marketing consulting. And yes, Jay, I mean, obviously, I am focused on the margin in that business. It\u2019s going to be deal specific from time-to-time. But overall, I would like to see the margins in that business continue to get better.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Nemeroff","Hi, thanks. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I am curious if maybe you could help us with how many more customers there are left to convert to the Creative Cloud from the Creative Suite and maybe just a sense of what inning we are in? And then also, if you could maybe comment a little further on the ETLA strength in the quarter. Shantanu, I think you had mentioned that you were starting to see some contracts from a couple of years ago start to come up for renewal. Should investors and should we expect that the strength in ETLA renewals is going to be similar to what we saw this quarter?","Shantanu Narayen","Yes, I think with respect to your first question on installed base migration, as you know, we don\u2019t update those on every quarter, but I would encourage you to look at the last numbers that we had at our MAX event. And you will see there is still very significant opportunity in both migration as well as market and value expansion. And I think those numbers still show significant headroom relative to where we are today. So, I think that\u2019s a good metric for you to look at. I think with enterprise ETLAs, 3 years ago, when we started this move of having enterprise customers license our software rather than buy it outright, we were just starting on this journey and it was nice as those 3-year terms are coming up to see that there is actually a fairly nice up-sell associated with that. People are now adopting the entire Creative Cloud. They may have only had single applications there and are adopting services. So, we certainly will continue to focus on that trend of driving significant up-sell as people come up for retention and demonstrating the value. So, we are pleased with it. And certainly from an execution point of view, we are going to focus on continuing to drive that over the next few years.","Michael Nemeroff","And could you talk about the pricing dynamics on those renewals?","Shantanu Narayen","I think the pricing dynamic has such a different range associated with it. I mean, we are certainly \u2013 it\u2019s very large range as a result of the size of the installed base. But I mean, as we look at it, we would like that to be greater than either the individual or the team for a number of our customers. And so it\u2019s driving overall sort of ARR and ARPU up from what other customers might pay.","Michael Nemeroff","Thanks for taking my questions.","Mike Saviage","Stephanie, we are coming up in an hour. Maybe we will do one more question, please.","Operator","Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ross MacMillan","Thank you. I just had one follow-up. Mark, obviously, on operating expense, your growth rates here have been running at around headcount growth levels. And I just wondered, as we think about going forward, should that still continue to be the case or could it be any sort of material diversion from headcount growth and OpEx growth in the future? Thanks so much.","Mark Garrett","No. As a software company, we are going to be tied pretty tightly to headcount. OpEx is going to be tied pretty tightly to headcount. So, I think you would see them track pretty closely together.","Shantanu Narayen","So, Ross thanks for asking that question. I think from my point of view as well as the management team, \u201816 is shaping up to be a great year. As you know, we raised our annual revenue target at the end of Q1 as well as our Digital Media annualized recurring revenue target. And it was good to confirm that we are on track to meet or exceed these financial targets. I am particularly pleased with the Digital Media ARR. We are 3 years into the transition. We continue to expect to add record bookings that exceed the $1 billion that we added last year. And in Digital Marketing, we continue to be the leader in this explosive customer experience category. I think most important though for me we continue to innovate in our major businesses. If you saw the announcements we have made both at Digital Marketing Summit in terms of the additions to the marketing platform roadmap as well as what we have announced both for Document Cloud and today for Creative Cloud, I think that positions us incredibly well for FY \u201817 and beyond. And from all of the questions that were asked, I mean we certainly believe that we have leverage in our model and we continue to demonstrate tremendous financial discipline on the expense \u2013 expense front and we will continue to do that. So, thank you for joining us today.","Mike Saviage","And this concludes our call. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
