After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our fourth quarter and full year financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our Web site at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial review call. During 2017, we delivered on all of our financial metrics. Adjusted EPS was $1.08 toward the upper end of our guidance range. Cash flow also came in at the upper end of our ranges. Based on our strong performance in 2017 and our confidence in our outlook, we are reaffirming our 8% to 10% average annual growth rate through 2020.","Further, we continue to transform and simplify the company. To that end, we are maximizing our efficiency with a new organizational structure which will yield an additional $100 million in annual cost savings by 2019. We\u2019re reducing our financial risk by prepaying $1 billion impairing debt. We\u2019re leveraging our platforms by adding 4.4 gigawatts of new capacity that its currently under construction. Through a balanced approach, we\u2019ve been reshaping our portfolio, while reducing our carbon exposure; first, by acquiring 2.3 gigawatts of renewable and launching the Fluence energy storage joint venture with Siemens; second, we announced that we are selling or retiring 4.3 gigawatts of merchant coal-fired generation.","Through this successful execution of our strategy, we are lowering the risk of our portfolio, particularly the volatility of our earnings and cash flow. At the same time, we are well positioned to deliver 8% to 10% average annual growth and adjusted EPS comparing free cash flow through 2020, achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019 and reduce our carbon intensity by 25% from 2016 through 2020.","I will now discuss these themes in more detail, beginning with maximizing our efficiency on slide four. We implemented a new $100 million cost savings plan as a result of our recently announced reorganization. This year, we are reducing our global workforce by 1,000 to 12%. These additional savings will strengthen our ability to deliver on our long-term financial commitments.","Next, I\u2019ll provide an update on some of our construction projects. In total, we have 4.4 gigawatts currently under construction, most of which are expansions of our existing plans and businesses. Beginning on Alto Maipo on slide five. As you may recall, this 521 megawatt hybrid project has been experiencing significant construction delay and cost overruns. However, since our third quarter call in November, we have reached a significant milestone whilst resolving outstanding issues.","Specifically, Alto Maipo negotiated a fixed price lump sum EPC contract with Strabag, the project\u2019s main contractor for the entire project. The new EPC contract, which is pending approval from the project lenders, transfers all of the geological risks to the contractor and includes material capital commitments from Strabag. The restructuring will require concessions from the project lenders and meaningful equity contributions from AES Gener, which are tied to construction milestones. We expect to receive approval from the lenders in the second quarter.","Although, we were very disappointed with the extended delays and increased costs to build out the Maipo, the new contract provides much greater certainty on both the schedule and the total costs to complete the remaining 38% of the project. Once completed, Alto Maipo will diversify AES Gener\u2019s generation mix and provide a zero emission source of power and capacity in Chile\u2019s load center for many decades.","Turning now to the rest of our construction program, beginning on slide six. Our 671 megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana achieved full load earlier this month. This plant is now in the commissioning phase and is expected to be completed in the first half of the year.","Now, turning to our 1.3 gigawatt Southland CCGT project on slide seven, which is a new construction on our existing gas generation sites in Southern California. Construction is proceeding as planned and the project on track to be operational by the first half of 2020. Shortly, we will also begin construction on this site on our long-term contracted 100 megawatt four hour duration lithium ion energy storage facility. This project will be the world\u2019s largest lithium ion energy storage facility.","Turning to slide eight, and our LNG businesses. In Panama this month, we started commissioning at our 380 megawatt Col\u00f3n CCGT. We expect to achieve first fire in March and COD early in the second half of this year. As you may remember, we\u2019re also building an LNG re-gasification and storage facility on the same site and expect to reach COD on time in 2019. In the Dominican Republic, we are in advanced discussions to secure new client for the access capacity at our LNG storage facility and to build the pipeline to connect the LNG terminal to the Eastern side of the Island. The pipeline will allow us to sell our access capacity as existing plant convert from heavy fuel oil and diesel to natural gas.","We expect to earn attractive returns given the limited amount of investment necessary and that the project will require no cash in corp. Our remaining construction projects are proceeding as planned, including our 1.3 gigawatt thermal plant OPGC 2 in India. These projects will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth through 2020.","Turning to slide nine. We have been reshaping our portfolio to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders, while reducing our carbon exposure. Our focus in on renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts. On a portfolio basis, these investments are expected to produce low to mid-teen IRs assuming a conservative terminal value. In general, we expect to receive at least 85% of the cash flow during the life of PPA. These compelling returns are driven by several factors, including; about half of our investments are in markets with lower renewable penetration and faster growth on U.S.; using our business platforms and global scale to lower cost, such as PV panel and wind turbine purchases; utilizing local debt capacity in the businesses to fund the investments; and bringing in partners to reduce our equity commitments, while providing management and development fees.","Turning to slide 10. In the last year, we acquired $2.3 gigawatts of renewable capacity with long-term contracts in three markets. First in the U.S., we closed on the acquisition of sPower together with the Alberta pension fund, AIMCo. sPower was a key driver in our 2017 growth and is continuing to execute on its more than 10 gigawatt development pipeline in the U.S. In fact, this year sPower signed long-term PPAs for 582 megawatts of solar and wind capacity with investment grade customers.","Second in Brazil, AES Tiet\u00ea acquired 686 megawatts of long-term contracted wind and solar generation. The equity required for these expansions was funded by using the debt capacity available at Tiet\u00ea. And third in Mexico, where we have 2.5 gigawatt development pipeline of renewables and natural gas infrastructure. We acquired a 306 megawatt Mesa La Paz wind development project. Mesa La Paz has a 25 year U.S. dollar denominated PPA with an investment grade private sector off-taker. The project site has sufficient additional land to accommodate up to 200 megawatts of solar, which could be an attractive upside in the future. We expect to reach financial close in March and begin construction shortly thereafter.","During 2017, we also made good progress on our initiative to offer new innovative energy solutions. As a result, in Hawaii we\u2019re delivering two solar plus energy storage facilities for a total of 47 megawatts of solar and 34 megawatts of five hour duration storage on the Island of Kauai. The first of these pioneering projects is under construction, and will satisfy energy demand during peak hours in the evening, as well as the rest of the day. We also closed on Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens. Fluence will deliver energy storage solutions and services to a broad group of customers from commercial and industrial companies to utility and power developers around the globe. In fact, the team is currently pursuing more than one gigawatt sales opportunities in 15 countries. The goal is for Fluence to consolidate its position as market leader in this high growth market. Lithium-ion base energy storage is expected to grow tenfold in five years, reaching at least 28 gigawatts of global install capacity by 2022.","In summary, as you can see on slide 11, we will be adding 8.3 gigawatts of new capacity by 2020. This represents 25% of our current install capacity and includes seven gigawatts of projects either under construction or recently acquired. The remaining 1.3 gigawatts reflect projects in advanced stage development, half of which are under signed contracts. As a result of these additions, our average remaining contract term will increase from six years currently to 10 years by 2020. We have sufficient internally generated cash to fund our equity contributions for all the projects I just discussed.","We're taking a balanced approach to decarbonizing our portfolio, recognizing that coal will continue to play a role. In 2017, we announced the exit of 4.3 gigawatts of merchant coal-fired generation, representing 30% of our coal fired capacity. Through these actions, we are significantly reshaping our portfolio to achieve our financial and strategic objectives.","As you can see on slide 12, by the end of 2020, we expect our coal fired capacity to decline from 41% to 29%, while renewables and gas will increase from 55% to 68%. Further, as you may have seen in our press release this morning and on slide 13, I am pleased to announced that based on these steps we've taken to-date, we are on track to reduce our carbon intensity by 25% from 2016 to 2020, and we will be aiming for a reduction of 50% by 2030.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financial results, capital allocation guidance, and expectations in more detail.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Thanks Andr\u00e9s. Good morning. Today, I\u2019ll review our 2017 results and capital allocation. We'll also discuss some recent business developments and conclude by addressing our guidance for this year, and expectations through 2020.","As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we finished 2017 on a strong note, achieving the upper end of our guidance range on all metrics and setting a solid foundation for growth through 2020. Adjusted EPS was $1.08. In the last two months of the year, we benefited from stronger margins at some of our businesses, a lower impact from hurricanes and a lower overall tax rate.","As shown on slide 15, most of our growth in 2017 was driven by higher margins, particularly in MCAC, contributions from new solar projects in the U.S. and the absence of a one-time reserve taken in 2016 in MCAC.","Now to slide 16, our adjusted PTC and consolidated free cash flow. We earned a little over $1 billion in adjusted PTC during the year. This was an increase of $167 million, primarily due to the same drivers as adjusted EPS. We generated $1.9 billion of consolidated free cashflow, a decrease of $323 million from 2016, primarily due to large receivables collections in Eurasia and Brazil in \u201916.","Now I\u2019ll cover our SPUs in more detail over the next five slides, beginning on slide 17. In the U.S., margins were flat. Adjusted PTC increased, primarily due to equity earnings for new solar projects at sPower and our distributed energy business. Lower consolidated free cash flow also reflects higher working capital requirements at DPL. Regarding sPower, we\u2019re very pleased with the businesses\u2019 performing since the acquisition. In November, sPower closed a $420 million 19 year financing at 4.6%, enabling us to meaningfully increase our returns on the business.","We also continue to receive inbound indications of interest at attractive valuations to partner on sPower\u2019s operating assets. Incorporating such a partner would further increase our overall return and transition a greater percentage of our capital into sPower\u2019s robust development pipeline. This backlog continues to grow and is yielding excellent projects with double-digit returns, including the 580 megawatts of recently signed PPAs, Andr\u00e9s mentioned.","In Andes, our results were relatively flat. Higher pricing in Argentina and a full year of operations at Cochrane in Chile were largely offset by the impact of Green Taxes and planned major maintenance at AES Gener in Chile. Lower adjusted PTC also reflects higher interest expense in Argentina. Consolidated free cash increased largely due to lower working capital requirements at Gener.","In Brazil, margins were flat while adjusted PTC benefited from the settlement of a legal dispute at our CCGT [indiscernible] in the first quarter 2017. The decrease in consolidated free cash flow is largely due to the high recovery in 2016 Eletropaulo to purchase power cost from prior drops. Most importantly, as part of our strategic shift away from the distribution business in Brazil, in Q4 we reclassified Eletropaulo to discontinued operations. This reduces our volatility and eliminates the disproportionate exposure to Brazil in our consolidated financial statements, given our 17% ownership interest. For example, we\u2019ve been consolidating over $3 billion of revenue with over $1 billion of unfunded pension liability with only $3 million of income in 2017.","Mexico, Central American and the Caribbean results reflect improved margins, driven primarily by higher contracted sales in the Dominican Republic, following completion of the combined cycle last year, as well as higher availability in Mexico. Adjusted PTC in \u201916 also reflects the reserve taken against certain of the reimbursements in MCAC in connection with a legal matter. Consolidated free cash flow also benefited from receivables collections in the fourth quarter in the Dominican Republic. I\u2019ll also note that our plan in Puerto Rico is now being dispatched and delivering much needed energy to the grid. Payments from the off take of preps have also resumed and we received $40 million since December.","Finally Eurasia, results reflects stable margins and the collection of a large overdue receivable in 2016 at Maritza in Bulgaria. Since the structuring and Maritza\u2019s PPA in 2016, the off-takers have been paying on-time. On the regulatory side, Maritza expects to have discussions later this year with the Government of Bulgaria regarding the European Commission's review of the PPAs compliance with [indiscernible]. We\u2019ll keep you updated as discussions progress.","Now to slide 22, and update on the impact of tax reform. As you know, we incurred a one-time non-cash charge of $1.08 in 2017 upon enactment of the new law, which was largely related to deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. This is a complex bill and some issues still remain to be clarified.","As we disclosed last month, in the near term we expect $0.05 to $0.08 annual impact, largely driven by two aspects; first, we expect meaningful limitation on interest deductions, which are now capped at roughly 30% of non-regulated U.S. EBITDA; second, under the new global intangible income rules, un-repatriated foreign earnings above a certain threshold can now be subject to U.S. tax. We have taken actions to offset these impacts and we'll continue to evaluate additional tax planning opportunities. In the longer term, these aspects of the tax reform they are beneficial to AES. For example, the adoption of a territorial tax regime will provide more flexibility in structuring new investments and repatriating profits.","Now to slide 23 and our improving credit profile. We ended \u201917 with $4.7 billion of parent debt and almost $2 billion reduction since 2011. As we announced in December, we used all the proceeds from the billion dollar Masinloc sale to further reduce parent debt, which will bring our debt to about $3.8 billion. As a result, we now expect to achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019, a year earlier than our prior expectations. We also have a high priority goal of attaining an investment grade rating by 2020. We believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation.","Now to 2017 parent capital allocation on slide 24. Sources on the left hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash consistent with our expectations. This includes $637 million of parent free cash above the midpoint of our expected range. Uses on the right hand side of the slide are largely in line with our expectations. Investment from subsidiaries are slightly higher than our prior disclosure, largely due to additional investments in U.S. renewables.","Now turning to our guidance on slide 25. Consistent with industry practice, these numbers exclude costs directly associated with major restructuring programs and the one-time non-cash charge of $1.08 resulting from the enactment of tax reform in 2017. Today, we're initiating guidance for 2018 adjusted EPS of $1.15 to $1.25 and reaffirming our target of 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020. Growth this year will be largely driven by contributions from new projects, cost savings and lower parent interest.","To break this down by SBU, we expect growth in U.S. to be driven largely by positive regulatory actions at DPL, as well as growth in renewables. And these will benefit from continued market reforms in Argentina, higher contracting levels at Angamos in Chile and higher generation in Columbia. Growth in MCAC is expected to be driven largely by completed construction projects, including a full year of operations at are combined cycle in the Dominican Republic, as well as the partial year impact from the commencement of operations at the Col\u00f3n CCGT in Panama. Finally, we also expect to benefit from cost savings and long-term interest.","This growth will be partially offset by business exits from the Philippine and Kazakhstan, and a higher tax rate driven by U.S. tax reform. Beginning this year, we\u2019ll no longer provide guidance on consolidated free cash flow, which does not accurately account for AES\u2019s ownership interest and our underlying businesses. We believe that parent free cash flow is the most tangible measure of our ability to achieve our financial goals, including strengthening our balance sheet and delivering value to shareholders.","Turning to slide 26. Parent free cash flow is expected to be relatively flat this year from $600 million to $675 million. This reflects lower expected distribution from Gener to allow for incremental investments in Alto Maipo and ensure the maintenance of their investment grade credit ratings. Consistent with prior expectations, we still expect 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020 off the 2017 base.","I\u2019ll now discuss our 2018 parent capital allocation on slide 27. Beginning on the left side, sources reflect $1.9 billion of total available discretionary cash, including the $600 million to $675 million of parent free cash flow just mentioned. Sources also assumed $1.25 billion in asset sale proceeds, including $1 billion sale of Masinloc in the Philippines and $250 million placeholder for additional asset sale this year. Regarding Masinloc, we recently received a key regulatory approval for the sale to close as early as the end of first quarter.","Now, the uses on the right side of the slide. Including the 8.3% dividend increase we announced in December, we\u2019ll be returning $345 million to shareholders this year as expected. We expect to use over $1 billion to reduce parent debt, including revolver drawings. Finally, we plan to invest at least $250 million in our subsidiaries, primarily from projects under construction leaving about $100 million unallocated cash.","Now looking at our capital allocation from 2018 through 2020 beginning on slide 28. We expect our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, roughly 60% of our market cap. This reflects parent free cash flow for the period, as well as our $2 billion asset sale target for 2020, half of which will be realized from Masinloc.","In terms of uses on slide 29, whether half has been allocated to the current shareholder dividend and debt reduction about 750 is allocated to identified investments in our subsidiaries, including projects under construction and late stage development. The remaining $1.25 billion, which is largely weighted towards \u201919 and 2020, is available to create shareholder value through investment in compelling growth opportunities, modest deleveraging of about $100 million to $200 million per year and potential growth in our dividend.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Tom. Before we take questions, let me summarize the concrete steps we\u2019re taking to transform and simplify the company; reducing our headcount by 12% this year for $100 million in sustainable cost savings; lowering our parent debt by 20%; investing in profitable, renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts, including the 2.3 gigawatts we acquired in 2017; and reducing our carbon exposure by exiting 4.3 gigawatts of merchant coal-fired generation.","Accordingly, as a result of our successful execution, we will deliver 8% to 10% average annual growth and adjusted EPS in parent free cash flow through 2020, achieve investment grade metrics in 2019 and reduce our carbon intensity by 25% from 2016 to 2020. Our overarching goal is to deliver sustainable and attractive risk adjusted total returns to our shareholders.","Operator, we would now like to open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator instructions]. The first question is from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","First question Andr\u00e9s on the Alto Maipo. In the past, when you have put that project as part of your construction pipeline, you resumed a zero return on the investments you've already made there. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s roughly the incremental investment you will need to make and the economic or financial case internally that you went through to decide, we should go forward with this as opposed to perhaps writing-off the previous investment you've made there?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I can\u2019t comment right now on what the amount of the additional investment AES Gener would have to make at this point. But that will happen when the financing is closed. But I would say that what is important is Gener has been strengthening its balance sheet, selling some assets. Also, as Tom mentioned, there'll be somewhat less dividends this year as a result of investments to be made in Alto Maipo.","Now in terms of what to do with the project going forward, of course what matters is just the marginal costs and the marginal benefits. And that's what we have been looking at. I think that from a strategic point of view, having Alto Maipo plus Las Lajas and Alfafal, that\u2019s all part of one big complex, you will have at the end 750 megawatts of capacity and power right in the low center of Chile.","So this we think will be a very attractive asset. And as you know, this will, I\u2019ll say balance Gener\u2019s risk because Gener has been very heavily weighted towards the coal plant. And as again Tom mentioned in his speech, we did have the impact of green taxes in 2017. So that's what we're looking at Ali. We\u2019ll look at the entire picture, it's like the marginal returns on the investments we're making and the positioning of Gener as a company into the future.","Ali Agha","Second question, as you mentioned the parent free cash flow profile is relatively flattish in \u201918. How does that impact your dividend plans? And when you think about the 8% to 10% growth in dividends, could we expect that as an annual number or would that follow the parent free cash flow profile?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think if you look at the growth of our dividend, I think we've had the fastest dividend growth of any company in our sector. And so I think going forward, we\u2019ll continue to analyze what's the best use of our cash. Certainly, we don't think we're getting a lot of credit for our growth in the dividend and the fact that we're on a path to become investment grade. So we will look at what we think is the best use of our cash going forward. I think we\u2019ve laid out our priorities as want to become investment grade and into that we have the transformation of the company that\u2019s underway that we\u2019ll decrease risk and we\u2019ll also ensure our growth into the future.","Ali Agha","And Andr\u00e9s just to clarify remind me again, that 8% to 10% growth in EPS and better free cash flow \u201918 through 2020. Are you also committing to an 8% to 10% growth in the dividend commensurate with that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","At this stage, we haven\u2019t made any comment on an 8% to 10% growth in the dividend. We\u2019re committing to adjusted EPS growth and the parent free cash flow growth.","Ali Agha","Last question, the billion dollars of asset sales that you are planning between \u201918 through \u201920 period. Is the impact of that already factored into that 8% to 10% EPS growth that you\u2019ve laid out for us?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Absolutely. And so I mean, we\u2019ve been talking about a balanced approach. I think if you look at our sales, we\u2019ve really gotten good value for our shareholders on those sales. As I said, we also think that coal will continue to play a role. But what we\u2019ve focused on, certainly we focused on coal merchant plans going in, we\u2019ve also focused on simplifying our portfolio. Now, depending on the quality of the asset whether it\u2019s a creative or dilutive that will depend, but this is baked into our vision of the future and what we will deliver.","So we feel very comfortable about hitting that billion dollar target, some are could be selling out and some could be selling down. And another factor in our strategy, which we perhaps haven\u2019t highlighted in this speech, but we\u2019ve attracted more than $4 billion of partnership capital. So we\u2019re really looking at maximizing our returns and partnership capital in general has given us a lot of flexibility and the allocation of our resources, helped us manage risk and it\u2019s also helped us into our returns.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","So two questions. How does the new solar power impact your growth plans for sPower? And then secondly, if you could elaborate a little bit about those negotiations concerning Maritza and some state aids that you mentioned. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the solar panel. The impact of the tariff, the 30% tariff, is baked into our forecast. And it hasn\u2019t had a material impact on the business. So I don\u2019t know Tom perhaps you\u2019d like to comment on it.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","I think as Andr\u00e9s has said, I mean the expectation of a tariff have been obviously out there for some time since early or middle of last year. Some of the being thrown around were actually higher than that so it\u2019s certainly within expectations of what was going to be passed. I think that was taken into account by our teams at sPower and our distributed energy business, so generally we\u2019ve moving forward. Sure on the margin there were small number of opportunities that fell off or at least that put on hold. But I think the team has been moving forward, most of it is evidenced by the large signing of contracts that we identified just most recently.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay, let me take the second question which is regarding Maritza. We just wanted to mention this at this stage it's very early to say what the outcome of this would be. It's basically known that DG comp of the European commission does reviews of long-term PPAs, and then whether they contain what's called illegal state aid. We feel we have a very strong contract. We will -- that there's a lot of ways that this could be resolved, and at this stage and I will keep you informed as it progresses.","But again we feel that we have a very strong contract. And as you know, a couple of years ago they ran up a very significant IOU, more than \u20ac400 million. On our calls we said, look, we expect to be paid because of the strength of our contracts and quite frankly because of the investment grade of Bulgaria and the fact the public sector had the means to which to pay. Those things were resolved, stay tuned, we'll see where this turns out. But again, we think we're starting from a strong position.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch.","Julien Smith","Just wanted to follow up on the last question a little bit. You\u2019ve alluded to or you reaffirmed today the 8% to 10%. Can you just clarify to the extent to which that that is inclusive of the asset sales basically that sort of an implicit guide up, because I think before you talk about the 8% to 10% being exclusive of those and needing to have find, call it cost cuts and\/or other sources to offset the dilution from asset sales. Am I thinking about that correctly?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","I think maybe we weren\u2019t as clear in the past. But I think the 8% to 10% is inclusive of asset sales. I think there\u2019s a basket of some things that we may sell out or sell down as Andr\u00e9s said. And it does also assume use of capital for deleveraging and reinvestment, I would say our reinvestment is at rates less than what we\u2019ve been investing at. So we feel quite good about those.","Julien Smith","Said differently again, you basically found the cost savings this point to fully offset the full slate of 2018 through 2020 asset sales. And again, just to make sure this is clear, that it\u2019s only billion dollars of asset sales that's reflected in that 8% to 10% or what magnitude through the full three year period?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","No, it's only an additional billion, so it's Masinloc plus a billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","I have one, one other question. The language you used to describe the impact of tax reform, as you say in, near term impact of $0.08 to $0.10. What is -- does that imply that the impact, all things equal and obviously this is before what you're doing to offset it, changes over time? And if so, can you give us some insight into whether it gets better or worse over time and a base case before offsets? And then other than the cost cutting which you\u2019ve been announced. What are the things that you\u2019re doing to offset that base case impact of tax reform?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","So let me take at a high level and then I\u2019ll pass it to Tom. What we\u2019ve talked about is $0.05 to $0.08 initially. There are two sides, so this one is the limitations on interest, expense, deductibility related to EBITDA in the U.S. And the second is the global intangible low tax income. Now, there remains a lot to be clarified on this law. So this is -- we\u2019re taking conservative approach to it. Why does this change overtime, well it changes because your asset base changes and also has to do with your level of indebtedness, changes overtime. So what happens overtime it gets better as the effects of a lower tax rate kick in. So that\u2019s number one.","Number two, as Tom said in his speech, we really clean the slate by basically using our NOLs to pay for the tax expense of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. So really as a result of it, we\u2019ll have a much more transparent tax position as time goes by. Now, we do need a further clarity, clarifying need to make sure that any actions we take to optimize our capital efficiency are the ones in the long term. So with that I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Greg, I think we say near-term it\u2019s a two to three year period. We look beyond that we\u2019re seeing lower impacts based on we see in that -- as we see it. There is lot of moving parts but in general as we work through our NOL position and as part of the charging took at the end of the year and the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, we used about $1.9 billion of our NOL. So as our NOL decrease and we move towards a taxable position over the next two to three years, the overall impact of tax reform from an earnings standpoint can actually be less. But I would probably say near-term $0.05 to $0.08 call it two to three years. And then as we look at it, we would see that number of potentials right down. Obviously, we\u2019re trying to make numbers lower and having the ramp down effect accelerated possible. So those are the things that are still work in progress.","Greg Gordon","And all that being said, that\u2019s fully baked into the growth rate expectations that you\u2019re aspiring to earnings and cash flow?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yes, we have the $0.05 to $0.08 impact baked into 2020.","Operator","The next question is from [Gregg Orrill] of UBS. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Maybe you\u2019ve address this a bit earlier. But in terms of your stance to keep AES Gener investment grade. What do you think is required there? What levers would you pull?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, we\u2019ve basically been pulling the levers we talked about in the past. We said Gener have a lot of levers, realized that Gener had a very good year in 2017. So we\u2019ve had some asset sales, sales in non-core assets. We have sold a peaking plant. And we\u2019re also in the process of selling some other non-core assets, which we think quite frankly were at very good multiples. And these will be used to pay down debt at Gener to shore it up. So while the Gener price has suffered greatly in the last say two years, at the same time, Gener in terms of if you look at it, our earnings this year or cash flow is really at record levels due to the fact that we cut the ribbon on time and on budget on the other projects. So Gener again, we will keep it the investment grade, there are a lot of levers to pull. And as we said, we weren't putting in more money from AES into Gener.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Gregg, I\u2019ll just say, basically the dividend we got last year from Gener was around $160 million, $170 million, it was AES share. And all the numbers we expect to have to be a lower number. I don't want to get specific because obviously Gener is a public company, but I\u2019ll just leave it that we are being more conservative with expectations for \u201918 until Alto Maipo gets tied up moving forward.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","The question on the cost cuts and you said strengthening the 8% to 10%. Could you maybe just give a little more color on what you mean by strengthening? Are you seeing yourself higher in the range or you have more cushion in the event that something doesn't go right. How should I think about that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think when we talk about strengthening, it\u2019s quite frankly. I\u2019ll say decreasing the band, increasing the certainty that you're going to hit your numbers. We had a lot of these things, I would say, in the works but it certainly feels good to have executed on them. So just to be clear on the cost savings program that we just announced, I mean, that's mostly executed. And we will have those numbers in hand in the first half of this year. And of course, we have the one time severance costs as well included in our number. So most of this is that we feel that as we execute, we reduce the -- or increase the certainty around our numbers and makes them more robust to any unforeseen possibility.","Steve Fleishman","And as you stand today, what do you see as the biggest risk to achieving the growth target, if any?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I would say, look. We have I think listed them. I think it's very important to close an Alto Maipo that we have, even though it does mean Gener has to make material contributions, this is very dramatic shift and the risk of this project, because we're going from one where essentially when it came to geological risk, it was cost plus to a one where we have certainty on the cost. And second, where we really have one contractor rather than two and that contractor will have significant skin in the game and every incentive to finish at the lowest cost and as early as possible. So I think that is very important.","I think, you know, as I mentioned regarding Bulgaria, this is something that we have to see the resolution of it. We think we're in a very strong position, like we thought we were -- when we ran at the \u20ac400 million of IOUs. But stay tuned, because it's too early to say where that would turnout. I think that we have opportunities for the upside in a number of our markets. I am very encouraged by the returns we're getting on our renewables and gas projects, especially outside the U.S., we have an excellent pipeline of projects in Mexico, dollar denominated with private sector off takers.","I'm very excited about the solar plus energy storage possibilities. We're excited about the sPower pipeline. And regarding Fluence, I think we're seeing that that market is starting to turn. This is a classic new technology, which will go through s-curve and we have to see when that turns up. Now speaking about Fluence, I think that\u2019s more of a play where it\u2019s not incremental earnings per year it\u2019s just really creating a lot of value, three years to five years from now probably, like we did with the Brazilian Telecom.","Steve Fleishman","And then last question just on the -- Tom, I think you mentioned something about a potential partner for sPower. Could you give a little more color on that and just -- or is it just mainly for somebody who would buy a stake in current operating projects?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Steve, we\u2019ve been approached by some parties about stakes in operating projects. And it would be something that we would do obviously with [s] and with AIMCo jointly. I mean it\u2019s just reinforces that value of their operating portfolio where we\u2019re obviously quite focused in the growth portfolio. But it reinforces the value of their operating portfolio and it\u2019s potentially attractive to some co-investors, so we\u2019ll see.","Steve Fleishman","And how it effectively part of your asset sales?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yes, it\u2019s part of a bucket of opportunities, basket of opportunities, yes.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","So instead of opportunities, $2 billion we got $1 billion is Masinloc of the billion dollar set, the set of opportunities is greater than billion.","Operator","The next question is from Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","Just specific I guess I\u2019m looking at slide 52 where you break down the adjusted PTC breaking by SBU. And Andes certainly had some strong growth, \u201918 versus \u201917. And I realized you don\u2019t -- you\u2019re not giving, when you talk about 8% to 10%, you\u2019re not breaking it down by SBU. But certainly, there is some very significant growth opportunities that you\u2019ve outlined in the U.S. as well as MCAC. I thought that maybe with the problems at Alto Maipo it would maybe take the wind out of the sales of the growth in Andes, and yet you hadn\u2019t good growth in \u201818. Am I being too hard on -- or the other opportunities in that SBU just greatly outlaying the problems at Alto Maipo or is Alto Maipo not as bigger hit as maybe I thought and I realized you haven\u2019t disclose that. Where am I going wrong maybe on my outlook for Andes?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Let me clarify. First, remember that again Gener had a record year last year. The Alto Maipo issues are perspective. This is not current. The drop in the price of Gener stock is part of I think a decrease in prospective prices, the market is thinking what are the future prices. Now realize Gener is fully contracted through 2023 and 50% thereafter, realize also that Gener is taking a very large market share of commercial and industrial contracts. So Gener is a strong company an investment grade company.","Now talking about Andes itself, we had a very good year in Argentina. We have 3 gigawatts of excellent assets in our Argentina, we\u2019ve always had. We\u2019ve had relatively low debt in Argentina. So to the extent that the wholesale market has liberalized in Argentina and dollarized, this has been a positive for us. Also realize that AES Gener is about 30% Columbia, 30% hydro in Chivor. So Andes is a SBU, it\u2019s much more than just Alto Maipo, and you realize that you're talking about, in total, almost 7gigawatts of capacity that you have in Andes and Alto Maipo being 500. So the important thing I think is to resolve Alto Maipo to decrease the uncertainty and I would expect to have a positive reaction in terms of Gener stock and hopefully AES stock as well.","Charles Fishman","So really Andes will contribute again realizing you're not breaking the 8% to 10% down by SBU. But you foresee Andes contributing through that 8% to 10%, just along with U.S. and MCAC, correct?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I'd say certainly we don't see it as a drag. I mean, we have interesting renewable opportunities in the region and that even Gener has solar projects now under construction. So there is a lot of opportunities in the region. And what we are looking forward to is resolving the issues of Alto Maipo and have certainty, and getting pass that and really focus on the other projects in the future.","Charles Fishman","Well, it sounds like your team has done excellent job of being close to resolving a difficult situation in Alto Maipo, so that's certainly a positive. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Lasan Johong of Auvila. Please go ahead.","LasanJohong","Andr\u00e9s, I'm a little confused. In the press release, it says that ASC classifying and Eletropaulo as a discontinued operation. And then Tom said that is going to be deconsolidated. My understanding was there going to deconsolidated not sold. So is there a change in status of Electropaulo?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","It\u2019s both deconsolidated and classified under discontinued operations. So that would be, as I said, will be part of -- so it\u2019s true on both counts. In other words, our revenues and operating costs and everything don't flow through our financials, which makes our financials much easier to understand, especially given the debt and unfunded pension and those kinds of things. But also as classified as discontinued operations that would say that we're going to continue on our strategic shift with respect to Electropaulo and assess our ownership interest.","LasanJohong","So at some point, it would be up for sale?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I don't want to get too specific, it\u2019s a public company, but that\u2019s being -- I think discontinued operations, you can bring it from there.","LasanJohong","Make our own assessment, okay. Andr\u00e9s, it sounds like AES is moving much more towards a carbon de-risking portfolio in the U.S. And so it's interesting, the development of sPower going forward. Would it be advisable at some point for AES to sell IPL and DPL and use that capital to bolster both sPower\u2019s development program and maybe do further renewable acquisitions in the U.S.?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","To me put a little bit carbon de-risking in perspective. So we're taking a balanced approach. We can see that coal could have a role to play in some markets well into the future. If you take our U.S. operations, for example, IPL, IPL will go from 79% coal to about 44% coal when we cut ribbon on Eagle Valley. So what we\u2019re really talking about is we see this as a long-term sort of de-risking. And we also will be doing things like we have found ways to run our coal plans at lower means, we\u2019re talking about taking down from 50%, 40% down to around 20%.","So this combined with at certain hours of the day very cheap renewables will allow us to run our coal -- decrease our carbon footprint, but at the same time take advantage of our coal plants using basically like large batteries. So when you talk about something like, IPL we think it\u2019s -- or DPL, these are part of that strategy and that they really complement what we are in terms of the various sources of financing we have and the various growth opportunities. So right now we would consider those utilities as core to our business proposition.","LasanJohong","Last question to Tom, the interest deduction restricts on the U.S. portion. Obviously, back on the envelop calculation, it looks like about $20 million to $30 million would not qualify out of about $265 million. Is that about right, are we in the same for the ballpark?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Just on a standalone basis, it\u2019s hard to look at the tax -- any tax piece of puzzle in isolation. But our U.S. income that would be available to shelter our interest would be less than that. Keep in mind that the U.S. income that\u2019s in the utilities and some of the other investments is not income that\u2019s available to offset interest, but it\u2019s a longer story than that.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think it\u2019s in our interest\u2026","LasanJohong","Just an unregulated stuff\u2026","Tom O\u2019Flynn","But as always, it\u2019s not quite that simple. I would say just coming down meaningfully our interest last year was about -- was well over 200, I think as we see it after paying down the billion dollars of debt and also looking at some other opportunities, we\u2019ll be under $200 million on a run-rate by mid-year. So next year we expect interest to be maybe $180 million or something in that ballpark. So by reducing debt, we\u2019re meaningfully limiting the issue.","LasanJohong","So next year how much of the interest expense would not qualify for the reduction?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","I think there is a lot of moving parts that started baking all together and said $0.05 to $0.08. And once again, it\u2019s hard to look at. Even some as before and some of the issue we talked about access taxes on foreign that could be an offset in part to the interest. So it\u2019s a lot of different equations but just to boil it down, we think $0.05 to $0.08 for the next two years or three years.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Thank you, and you may begin.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Angie, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. We appreciate you being us this morning. Joining me today are Andres Gluski, our President and CEO; Victoria Harker, our Chief Financial Officer; our Chief Operating Officer for Generation, Ned Hall; and Andrew Vesey, our Chief Operating Officer for Utilities; and other senior members of our management.","Before we begin our presentation, let me remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements, which are subject to certain risks. For a complete discussion of these risks, we encourage you to read our documents on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Our presentation is webcast, and the slides are available on our website, which you can get at www.aes.com, under Investor Relations.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Andres Gluski, our Chief Executive Officer. Andres?","Andres Gluski","Thanks, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we reported solid performance in the fourth quarter.","For the full year, adjusted earnings per share grew 6%, and we achieved record subsidiary distributions of more than $1.3 billion. Despite a volatile macroeconomic and commodity price environment, we met or exceeded our 2011's guidance of all key earnings and cash flow metrics.","We also delivered on our key strategic initiatives, including several large asset sales, closing on a major acquisition and commissioning 2000 megawatts of new generation capacity.","Before I delve into the detail of these initiatives, I would like to share my thoughts on 2 key questions that I heard repeatedly during our meetings with investors and analysts during our East and West Coast Roadshows. The first was asking for greater clarity regarding our capital allocation strategy and the second was projected earnings and cash flow growth beyond 2012.","As I said on our last call, we intend to maximize shareholder value by flowing our businesses in those markets, where we have \u2013 or have a heavy plan to create a competitive advantage, exiting over time, those markets where we do not and focusing on creating value on a per-share basis by competing investment in growth with debt paydowns and share buybacks. Our discretionary cash consists of our distribution from subsidiaries, plus proceeds from asset sales, less corporate overhead, taxes and interest payments. ","We will allocate our discretionary cash to 3 primary uses: first, repayment of recourse debt at the parent. I believe that decreasing our leverage will help improve the market's perception of AES' risk profile. In a volatile global financial environment, less perceived risk should improve our valuation. Here, our goal is to achieve at least a one notch upgrade to double-B over the medium term, and we intend to pay down at least $500 million of parent debt. ","Second, we will use our discretionary cash to fund growth projects and\/or repurchase shares. Our goal is to invest to create the most value on a per-share basis. I want to make it very clear that when it comes to investing in growth projects, these will be benchmarked against debt paydowns and share repurchases. For any investment, we will consider its strategic fit, its adjusted earnings per share and dividend contributions, as well as the net present value created and its capital efficiency, measured as NPV over AES equity investment.","In order to ensure the optimal allocation of capital, we have formed an investment committee, which evaluates our pipeline of all possible investment alternatives in light of the criteria I previously mentioned. To align individual incentives with our objective, we revised compensation plan to be based both on project NPV and capital efficiency metrics. We expect that these changes will improve our return on invested capital and create significantly more shareholder value over time.","Regarding the development and construction of new assets, our primary focus will be on platform expansion in those markets where we believe we have a compelling competitive advantage. As a reminder, our core markets are Brazil, Chile and United States. In addition, we have growth projects underway in Turkey, the Philippines and India.","By focusing on platform expansions rather than entering new countries, we can improve the average returns and hit rates while spending less on business development. ","I would like to highlight a few important projects in our development pipeline. In Chile, we are making good progress in developing the Cochrane project, a 552-megawatt coal project, including a 24-megawatt lithium battery, energy storage system adjacent to our new Angamos facility and Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt hydroelectric project near Santiago. Both are essentially expansions of existing facilities.","In Turkey, we announced an agreement to develop a 625-megawatt coal project with our partner Ko\u00e7, and in addition, Oyak, one of the leading pension funds in the country. Finally, in the Philippines and India, we are well positioned to add up to 1800 megawatts by expanding our Masinloc and OPGC plants. ","In certain markets such as Brazil, Chile and India, we have cash on hand and the ability to tap local funding sources, both equity and debt, so we can grow without depending on additional cash from the quarter.","With regard to share repurchases, we've been buying back our stock since July 2010, and as we discussed on our third quarter call, we have repurchased a total of 33.9 million shares at an average price of $11.14. However, in the fourth quarter, we used our liquidity to fund our Dayton Power & Light acquisition and as a result, we have not bought back stock since. Therefore, as of today, we still have $122 million remaining under our current authorization for share buybacks. Third, as you know, we intend to initiate an annual dividend of $120 million in the third quarter of 2012 with the first payment expected in the fourth quarter. I realized that we're starting with a relatively low yield of approximately 1.1%. However, as our earnings and current free cash flow grow over time, we expect to increase the dividend to be more in line with the average yield in the market.","Now turning to our expected long-term growth rate. As we announced in our press release, we expect to achieve a 21% adjusted EPS growth rate this year. Beyond 2012, starting from our guidance midpoint of $1.26 in earnings, we expect to deliver average annual total returns of 8% to 10% through 2015. This total return to shareholders will consist of 2 components.","First, we expect a compounded annual adjusted EPS growth rate of 7% to 9% from 2013 through 2015 from the following: our existing portfolio of assets. This will be driven primarily by demand growth in our faster growing markets and profitability improvements across the portfolio; completion of the 2300 megawatts of new generation under construction. Although this will be a modest contributor to the growth rate as the largest of these projects, Mong Duong in Vietnam, will not come online until 2015; achieving an additional $50 million of cost savings by the end of 2013 as we discussed in our last call; and improved allocation of our discretionary cash through a combination of parent debt repayment, share buybacks and investments.","The base case assumes a mix of debt repayment and share repurchases that is target to achieve our credit metric goals. Investments and acquisitions would have to be accretive to the base case scenario. ","The second component of our total annual returns is a $120 million annual dividend we will declare starting the third quarter of this year. The dividend represents 1.1% of our total average annual return target of 8% to 10%. I would note that our average annual total return target of 8% to 10% does not assume any expansion of our P\/E multiple. Any improvement of our P\/E multiple, as a result of an improving risk profile, would represent upside to our total return commitment.","Now I would like to provide you with an update on our portfolio and other initiatives, including recent asset sales, integration of Dayton Power & Light and our completed construction projects and construction pipeline.","For asset sales, we are executing on our plans to narrow our geographic and line of business focus by exiting nonstrategic markets over time. We believe that we can create more shareholder value by selling nonstrategic assets and redeploying those proceeds in accordance with our capital allocation strategy.","As I discussed in the past, we're targeting up to $2 billion of proceeds through AES from asset sales over the next few years. I am pleased to announce that we are more than 1\/3 of the way towards achieving that goal. Since September of 2011, we have closed 4 asset sales, representing approximately $530 million in proceeds to AES: Atimus, the Brazil Telecom, 2 Argentine distribution companies and our plants in the Czech Republic and Spain. We have also announced 2 new transactions in the past few weeks: the sale of Red Oak and Ironwood, 2 gas-fired plants in the U.S. for a total net proceeds of $230 million.","These transactions demonstrate the potential value creation of asset sales. Collectively, these businesses represent $32 million of net income to AES in 2011. With proceeds of approximately $760 million for all the asset sales closed or announced since September, we achieved a P\/E multiple of 23x 2011 earnings.","Now let me update you on our Dayton Power & Light acquisition. As you know, the deal closed in November of last year in record time, only 7 months after its announcement. The integration of DP&L is on track, and we are preparing for the Standard Service Offering filing with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio in late March, with a new tariff to be effective in January 2013.","We remain pleased with the strategic fit that DP&L will provide, and we look for sourcing opportunities and other platform benefits to be derived over the medium term. DP&L is well positioned to benefit from coming environmental regulations as the majority of its fleet has already been scrubbed. In addition, as we explained in the past, the acquisition will help us monetize our $2.1 billion of net operating losses.","Since the acquisition closed in November, however, we have seen margin reduction at DP&L, primarily driven by lower gas prices, as well as increased customer switching. To that end, lower gas prices have negatively affected our 2012 outlook for DP&L's earnings contribution to AES by approximately $0.03.","As is the case with other Ohio utilities, DP&L is experiencing higher customer switching rates, primarily due to the impact of weak gas prices on power prices. This also makes customer shopping more attractive. ","To give you some perspective, in 2011, 47% of total retail sales had switched to alternate suppliers, up from 32% in 2010. Although DP&L's retail arm was able to capture 87% of the switch load, switching reduced gross margin by $58 million last year. Going forward, we have adjusted our forecast to reflect the current market conditions. Although we do not expect DP&L to be slightly dilutive to earnings this year, excluding one-time noncash transaction charges, we still project $180 million in cash contributions from DP&L in 2012.","Now let me allow -- now allow me to provide some color on our construction pipeline. I am pleased to announce that we have commissioned more than 2000 megawatts of new capacity in 2011. Our 3 largest projects were the 545-megawatt Angamos coal project in Chile, including our 20-megawatt lithium ion battery energy storage system and the 223-megawatt Changuinola hydroelectric power plant in Panama, and finally, the 670-megawatt Maritza facility in Bulgaria.","In addition, we completed the 120-megawatt Laurel Mountain wind and energy storage project in the United States, and, in addition, we've had 477 megawatts of gas and solar projects during the year.","AES is now operating 72 megawatts of lithium ion battery as a grid resource, making us a market leader in this innovative use of technology. In 2012, we will have full-year contribution from all of these projects. New capacity is the primary driver of our 21% earnings growth we are expecting for 2012.","Contributing to future growth, we have more than 2300 megawatts of capacity under construction. In 2012, we're expecting to complete 250 megawatts of new wind and solar generation capacity. The 270-megawatt coal fire Campiche project in Chile is ready to come online in 2013 and the 1200-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam is scheduled for completion in late 2015.","It is important to note that we have already fully funded the equity for all of these projects under construction. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Victoria to discuss our 2011 financial performance and the outlook for 2012.","Victoria D. Harker","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to briefly cover the following topics: 2011 full year results and the comparison to guidance; fourth quarter results, including key operating drivers; earnings per share, cash from operations and free cash flow and parent liquidity; and then finally, our 2012 guidance.","As Andres mentioned, we met or exceeded our 2011 guidance targets for all key financial metrics. Our adjusted earnings per share of $1.04 represents a 6% increase over 2010 and exceeds our guidance range. Importantly, AES' 2011 proportional free cash flow of $932 million is also at the high end of our range, allowing us to achieve an all-time high for subsidiary distributions of more than $1.3 billion.","Key drivers of this performance are the contributions of several new businesses, which came online in 2011; strong demand and volume growth in Latin America; as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rates. These positive trends offset the expense related to the acquisition of Dayton Power & Light, the impacts of the reserves required for the terror-free sale at Eletropaulo in Brazil, coupled with lower volumes and rates at several of our European businesses. ","As a reminder, as we discussed on our third quarter earnings call, we had anticipated that the tariff in Eletropaulo was to be reset in July 2011, impacting the next 4 years. Although the formal tariff notification is still pending, we expect it to be finalized by July 2012, retroactive to July 2011. Given that most of the terms of the tariff have now been determined by the regulator, we've been accruing for the projected impact of these changes since July 2011.","As also previously mentioned last quarter, this cost is approximately $104 million per quarter, resulting in an earnings per share impact of $0.015.","Now let's discuss results for the fourth quarter in greater detail, starting with the most significant drivers of operating results. There are 3 key operating trends to highlight in our fourth quarter results. ","First, we recorded higher volumes at our Generation businesses in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, Colombia and Chile, compared to the same period last year. In particular, at GSA in Brazil, volumes grew 2% due to favorable weather conditions and higher demand at Eletropaulo.","Gener, with 4800 megawatts in operation in Chile and Colombia, also recorded higher electricity volumes due to beneficial weather and hydrological conditions, as well as continued energy demand growth supporting mining activities in the north of Chile.","Second, in Panama, we benefited from higher energy spot prices due to the demand growth of approximately 5% and system supply constraints elsewhere, as well as business interruption insurance proceeds.","Third, our new businesses also added to our strong fourth quarter results. These include the Maritza facility in Bulgaria and the Angamos power plant in Chile, which commenced operations in June and April 2011, respectively. Both of these businesses made first-time contributions to fourth quarter results in 2011, as did DP&L.","Turning to our quarterly earnings per share. During the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings per share declined by $0.02 to $0.23. This was the result of the DP&L expenses incurred prior to closing, with an impact of approximately $0.06, which offset the positive operating trends I just outlined.","Similarly, compared to a year earlier, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations declined $0.04 to $0.12 for the quarter, driven by positive operating performance in Latin America, but offset by DP&L transaction costs and unrealized foreign currency losses.","Now to address cash flow. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our guidance targets on all of our cash flow metrics for the year. This is a very positive indicator of our healthy and growing operations. However, our cash flows from operations and free cash flow metrics declined from 2010 to 2011 on both a consolidated and proportional basis.","As you may recall, 2010 cash flows benefited from several one-time items, such as $107 million tax credit in Brazil, collection of outstanding receivables from the Dominican Republic, as well as regulatory asset recoveries in Brazil.","In 2011, we did not assume the recurrence of similar one-time benefits, and in fact, in 2011, our cash flows were reduced by some one-time impactors. For example, we had a large one-time tax payment in the fourth quarter of 2011 related to the sale of our Brazil telecoms business. In addition, the losses incurred in Eastern Energy, a business no longer part of the AES portfolio, reduced our 2011 cash flow year-over-year.","However, neither of these impacts will be ongoing and instead, both reflect positive actions taken within the portfolio as clearly indicated in the $284 million in pre-tax proceeds coming from the Brazil Telecom sale.","Furthermore, our strong operating cash flows are quite apparent in our subsidiary distribution results, as we achieved an all-time high of $1.3 billion in 2011.","Now turning to parent liquidity. As you recall, in the second quarter of 2011, we had issued $2 billion of recourse debt at the parent to finance the acquisition of DP&L, which we closed in November. As a result, we finished the year with $693 million in liquidity. During the fourth quarter, we also invested $110 million in construction and development projects, primarily to fund our renewable construction projects.","In summary, 2011 was a strong year with the completion of 2000 megawatts of construction projects, the acquisition of DP&L and $15 million in permanent cost reductions achieved. This puts us well on track to achieve $50 million of savings per year in 2012 due to reduced business development costs and support function efficiency efforts. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver a significant earnings growth in 2012.","Now I'll spend a few minutes on our guidance for 2012. Since we affirmed our 2012 guidance in November, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates have moved. As we typically do each year, we've updated our guidance to reflect changes in the forward curve for both commodities and foreign currencies through the end of the prior reporting period.","Using the forward curves as of the end of December and consistent with the sensitivities we provided in November, the impact to our midpoint of adjusted EPS is a net reduction of approximately $0.06. Since that time, the forward curves have rebounded somewhat. We'll continue to monitor this, as well as all other factors impacting our guidance and update you accordingly.","Thus, our updated adjusted earnings per share guidance range for 2012 is now $1.22 to $1.30, with the midpoint of $1.26, primarily reflecting these updated forward curves. The midpoint of $1.26 for this year reflects growth of 21% over the $1.04 we achieved in 2011.","Significant drivers of this will include: in 2011, we incurred $0.13 of acquisition and financing costs related to DP&L prior to its close. The largest driver of year-over-year growth is the contribution of new businesses, primarily Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, in total, adding $0.17 to 2012.","In addition, from our existing businesses, we expect to benefit from operational improvements and cost reductions of $0.05 mix in 2012. Further, a reduced share count due to our 2011 share buybacks adds $0.02. As an offset to this factor, we have lower rates in 2012, primarily Eletropaulo in Brazil and at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland, which will reduce adjusted EPS by $0.06.","We expect the slightly higher tax rate will negatively impact adjusted earnings per share by $0.02. And we are currently projecting unfavorable foreign currency and commodity price movements of $0.07 versus the rates for full-year 2011.","Keep in mind that our adjusted EPS guidance assumes the extension of TIPRA, tax legislation which impacts some part of the income and an effective tax rate for 2012, which is in line with our tax rate for 2011.","As in prior years, we expect Congress will extend this tax exemption sometime during the year, but it has not been passed as yet. If TIPAR is not extended, the impact to our 2012 adjusted EPS guidance would be approximately $0.12. However, we believe that there may be additional actions we can take to help reduce this drag if necessary.","Also note that only the cash and earnings impacts of closed asset sales, including Brazil Telecom, the Bohemia plant in the Czech Republic, the Argentine distribution companies and Cartagena in Spain are incorporated in our 2012 guidance at this point in the year.","For example, the impacts of the pending Red Oak and Ironwood sales are not yet included and will not be until they close. We believe the adjusted EPS impacts of these transactions are limited, as a result of the attractive valuations we expect to achieve. However, as we progress further in our asset-sale program, we may experience some near-term dilution in our earnings until we can redeploy the proceeds. As a result of all of these factors, our 2012 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint is now $1.26. ","Similar to adjusted earnings per share, cash flow trends are projected to be very strong in 2012. Driven primarily by the contributions of our new businesses, we're expecting a range of $1 billion to $1.25 billion proportional free cash flow. Our guidance midpoint for this metric represents an increase of 23% over 2011 results. With respect to subsidiary distributions, we're projecting a range of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Based on the midpoint, we're expecting to achieve an increase of 7% in subsidiary distributions over our record-high levels produced in 2011.","Turning now to our 2012 near-term capital allocation plan. Over the course of 2012, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of organic parent free cash flow. This will be used to fund dividends, growth investments, share repurchases and parent debt repayments, based on the return price profile of opportunities available.","In addition, we expect to receive $460 million or more of asset-sale proceeds over the course of 2012. Much of this cash is expected to be received in the second half of the year. The cash will be allocated in the total return framework for 2015, as Andres discussed.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres.","Andres Gluski","Thanks, Victoria. Last fall, we announced our plan to unlock shareholder value and I am pleased with our execution over the past 6 months.","In 2011, we achieved or exceeded our guidance for our earnings and cash flow metrics. 2012 should be another good year as we expect to deliver 21% growth in adjusted EPS. Furthermore, we will use the multiple levers at our disposal to deliver on our average annual total return target of 8% to 10% from 2013 through 2015. We'll remain focused on executing on our business strategy and growing per-share cash flow in earnings in a disciplined way.","I am very encouraged with the potential for growth that exists in our core markets. In addition, we are committed to strengthening our balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders through a dividend to be initiated later this year.","I look forward to seeing many of you as we continue our investor outreach efforts over the next several months, including a visit to investors in London next month. ","Operator, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Julien Dumoulin-Smith, UBS. Why don't you -- great quarter guys. I wanted to ask first, here, with regards to redeployment of cash, you guys talked about potential near-term dilution. What are you seeing out there in terms of organic opportunities. And then maybe on the second -- the other hand, what about timing of debt buyback and potentially, greater share buybacks? At what point should we start this bidding kind of building that into our models and thinking about that -- achieving that EPS growth rate you guys just described?","Andres Gluski","Okay, Julien, in terms of the redeployment of cash, what we have done to date with the money we have received from the asset sales is to repay the revolver at the parent. So currently, we had used the revolver to help with the acquisition of DP&L. And currently, we only have a balance of around $50 million outstanding. In terms of the sort of organic opportunities, that's a very good question. We think that in our key markets and from our platforms, there are opportunities to make relatively small investments to help boost profitability, and we will be looking at these as well. And in terms of the buybacks, that will depend in debt buybacks or other buybacks -- it will be dependent in terms of when these monies come in. So I think the framework is very clear. Of course, any of these transactions have to go through FERC approval, so the timing of this is probably in the later half of the year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then maybe addressing the EPS growth rate that you guys just threw out there. I mean, knowing your underlying organic growth projects that you've described, would you imagine that, that EPS growth would be backward, sort of backloaded, if you will, to get to the, call it, $1.50, $1.60 that you're talking about?","Andres Gluski","Again, we're committing to this 8% to 10% and we feel very confident about it. The exact profile of that, we will update over time as we see things progress and that will include, of course, what assets we sell and what other sort of investments we've made, where do we redeploy that cash. Obviously, some uses will be more immediately accretive than others. So we'll get back to you that -- over time as things develop.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then maybe just in terms of the organic projects, you guys have talked a little bit about it on the call. In Chile, how are the permitting and TPA processes going? When should we think about closing those transactions and seeing a financial closure and moving forward?","Andres Gluski","Well, I think they have different timelines. I think the fastest timeline would be the Cochrane project in the North. As you know, there's a very big expansion of a mining sector in Chile. People have talked about numbers of $50 billion of new investments coming into the mining sector. They will need energy and so, we are, right now, talking with various counterparties to see if we get the PPA. This is a -- basically, an Angamos 2 project, if you think about it. And we have the best track record in Chile of delivering plants on time. So we -- we're in a very strong position right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And final question here and then I'll leave you guys. At Masinloc 2, you guys, I believe, in the quarter, got a contract on Masinloc 1 -- just be curious to hear to what extent that's impacted earnings? And then secondly, what is the latest on expanding Masinloc 2? You've kind of alluded to it a little bit.","Andres Gluski","Regarding Masinloc 2, right now, we're quite advance in the permitting stage. The contracts that you were referring is with the big distribution group of Meralco in the Philippines that we're in sort of final process of closing those. So I would say that going forwards, to do a Masinloc 2, there's very strong demand for growth on Luzon, which is, really, this is the Luzon grid that we're talking about, and we think this is one of the projects that can come online fastest to meet that growing demand. But -- so right now, we're advancing with the permitting and we will be looking at contracting some of this event -- some of this capacity.","Operator","Ali Agha.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm from SunTrust. A couple of questions here. Just first of all, I wanted to just get a little more clarity on the assumptions you laid out for your 2012 guidance? If I have read it correctly, you're assuming no more share buybacks or debt reduction from what's already been done in the '12 guidance, is that right?","Victoria D. Harker","In the baseline, that's not to say we won't use cash for those purposes once it's available and on hand. But in the baseline set of ranges that I spoke to, that is not assumed as an uplift.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes. Also, as I recall, when the DPL acquisition was done, you had assumed, originally, I think it was 6x of accretion in '12. Andres, in your remarks, you mentioned that gas prices and switching has impacted it by negative $0.03, but then I also heard you say that DPL would actually be dilutive in '12. Could you just clarify exactly DPL's contribution in '12 versus the original $0.06 you had assumed?","Andres Gluski","Let me clarify it. The $0.03 that I referenced, that is the sensitivity to lower gas prices. Did it make that clear? I don't know, Victoria, you want to comment on the second part of the question?","Victoria D. Harker","Yes. See, right now, our current projections, which are still being assessed since, obviously, we are just only a month or so into operating DP&L. So the remainder of the $0.05 to $0.07 that we had assumed, the $0.03 down for the commodity prices is -- probably puts us another $0.04 or below in terms of customer churn and rate erosion that we've seen. That said, obviously, the team has just gotten underway in terms of their efforts on the retail side, so we're continuing to assess that. But embedded in the baseline plan, we have it at 0 to slightly dilutive.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I see. Also, Victoria, I guess, for you. You mentioned, of course, TIPRA extension is still built into your guidance and then you alluded to the fact that if TIPRA does not get extended, there were some offsets. Could you elaborate a little more on what those are? And let's just make it clear that if TIPRA doesn't get extended, are we still looking at a $1.26 midpoint for '12?","Victoria D. Harker","The question, pull [ph] on this, as we have talked about in the past, is that, obviously, that part of income comes from the Latin American, the countries Argentine, Brazil and Chile predominantly. So as we look at mitigation strategies, as we go into the latter half of this year, we could choose to make other decisions relative to repatriation of cash and using it for investment locally, which will obviously have some other flow-through impacts from a parent operating cash flow and use of funds standpoint. So my point was to layout what's assumed in the baseline. If we took no further mitigation actions, it would have a $0.12 full-year impact. As we go further into the year, we're obviously accruing, assuming it is going to occur and then we will take those actions as we see fit later on this year.","Andres Gluski","Yes. To answer the question, I mean, we feel very confident that TIPRA will be extended. We lived through this in 2010. So to realize, we will have to accrue it to higher tax rates until it gets actually passed and then we, of course, make the adjustments. But what would this mean for us? Well, basically, it would mean that if you had some major tax changes and you no longer have the subpart and TIPRA exemptions, then you would basically have to, I think, upstream less cash and use more of the cash locally to grow that way. So it's something that we've thought about very well and it's differing structuring opportunities. And we would do so, again, seeing what's going to happen here. But again, we feel quite confident that once again, TIPRA will be extended.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And Andres, just to be clear. If it is not, you're still committed to the $1.26 guidance for '12 -- the midpoint?","Andres Gluski","We would have to come back to you at that time and see what are the changes that are made. And as Victoria said, probably, from sort of the baseline, where we are today would be the $0.12 and then we would have to have mitigations and we would have to see what's the timing of those mitigations for 2012.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my last question, going back to your longer-term guidance that you laid out. Again, just to be clear on the assumptions there. So while in '12, you\u2019ve not assumed in your base case any more debt or share reduction or buybacks over that '12 through '15 period -- or '13 through '15. You have assumed some additional paydowns coming from the debt or share buybacks happening. Also a little bit from that is indeed the case? And then secondly, just on a high-level basis, over that period of '12 through '15, how should we be thinking about the DPL contribution? Is it flat, is it declining, is it going up? Just directionally, how is that playing out?","Andres Gluski","Okay. Let me answer sort of the multiple questions if I remember them all. First, starting from the growth rate, from, again, 2013 through 2015. So this is off the base of 2012, which already has grown 21%. So starting from that base, our assumption is that our -- that we are using 50-50 debt paydown and share repurchases. That's what we've modeled in there with some very sort of modest asset sales. Then the -- so then next question, sorry, which was...","Victoria D. Harker","Debt paydown versus share buyback, it depends on, obviously, the asset-sale proceeds and amounts that we received and the timing, that we've essentially modeled as a convention of 50-50 split between share buyback and debt paydown.","Andres Gluski","Yes. And the second one about DP&L. What we're -- basically, the view is that we will be, again, filing in March. We'll have to see the outcome of that filing. I think if you look at the capacity of price auctions, these have improved for '14 and '15. So we think that probably '12 and '13 would be the 2 most difficult years at DP&L and then we see improvements after that.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And last question, sorry for that. On the dividend, Andres, should we assume -- the payout -- the $120 million that you have laid out is about 20% payout on your midpoint parent [ph] free cash flow for '12? Is that the payout, ultimately, you're comfortable with? Or what is your comfort level on the payout for that dividend?","Andres Gluski","Yes. I would say we're comfortable with at least that at this stage. And I would like to clarify that when I was talking about sort of the market -- more in line with the market, I was talking about the S&P, sort of the 2% range.","Operator","Gregg Orrill.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Barclays Capital. I was wondering if you had looked at what the impact on the sensitivities would be to the 2012 guidance? I know you used end of year -- end of 2011 as a benchmark for your guidance. But it looks like it would be a more positive driver at this point?","Victoria D. Harker","Yes, this is -- Gregg, this is Victoria. I think the -- our view right now is somewhere in the $0.05 to $0.06 range for the combination of the 2. That was as of year end and we'll obviously continue to update that, as we go through the year, with other factors along with commodities, as well as currencies.","Andres Gluski","Yes. We've really chosen sort of the year end, that's what we've always done. And it has been moving back and forth. So we couldn't sort of up -- what is today's. But you're right, they have moved in the other direction since the end of the year.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And in your earnings drivers for 2012, there was also -- Victoria called out $0.02 for the tax rate as well. Was there anything specific there? Or were...","Victoria D. Harker","You're talking about from a year-over-year standpoint?","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, right.","Victoria D. Harker","Yes. We had a change in income mix between the 2 years relative, as well as an evaluation allowance release in Brazil at the end of 2011. So that naturally improved 2011 on a one-time basis.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then when should we look for the DP&L filing, the ESP filing?","Andres Gluski","Maybe, Andy, who's with us here and he's Chief Operating Officer of the Utilities, he should be able to answer.","Andrew Martin Vesey","It should be a short answer. We're targeting that stipulation, March 31. So that's when the final will be made.","Operator","Brian Russo.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Ladenburg Thalmann. Just to be clear on the 7% to 9% earnings CAGR, is that based -- is that supported by yet-to-be-announced asset sales and the corresponding use of that as a sale proceeds to pay down debt or buyback stock?","Andres Gluski","No. No, I mean, basically, you were laying out that target, there's a lot of organic growth there. But if we do asset -- additional asset sales in line with what we have announced, again, there'll be lumpiness as Victoria had noted, between the sale and redeploying that cash in some instances. So I think we've played out in terms of what's the criteria we're going to use about redeploying that cash. We do think that -- what we're looking at now, we think, we'll get a much better sort of capital efficiency in terms of the NPV created for AES equity use and we really want to use those -- our ability, where we have either trapped cash, cash on hand or unused leverage at the local level. All of these ways is really a way of leveraging even more AES returns.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just also -- in terms of -- you've spent -- you've targeted about $2 billion of asset sales, and I think you've achieved roughly 1\/2 of that. Can you talk about non-core markets or particular assets to help get you to that $2 billion target?","Andres Gluski","Sure. I mean, we've been quite careful about we announce. Obviously, our primary focus is to sell well and to optimize our operations until the sale. What we -- what is out there is we're selling all of our China assets and I think that's out there as well. And what we consider non-core, I mean, or, let's say, nonstrategic, I think the real key is, do we have a compelling competitive advantage or can we get one? Because we may be in some new markets, we just started. Now, where we think we'll get to have to be really -- the size and the scale and the diversity to have an advantage in that market. But when we see that we can't have that, we will sell. So take the 2 gas plants that we sold in the U.S., those are plants that were contracted for a long time and we really felt that we could better redeploy that cash and increase our shareholders' reserves. So that's sort of the view. I mean, if you look at the sale of the telecoms in Brazil, we really thought that the market had peaked. If we wanted to stay in that market, it would require very significant investments. That's not one of our -- telecoms is not a core market for us. So we will sell out. The long-term view is to simplify our portfolio and that also feeds into our cost reduction targets here in terms of corporate overhead and cost of goods sold. But we have to do it in a prudent manner. We really don't want to go and have a fire sale of markets \u2013 some markets have been quite depressed. But we've been, I think, very effective at executing well on sales like in Cartagena in Spain.","Operator","Maura Shaughnessy.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","Maura Shaughnessy, MFS. A couple of questions. First, can you just characterize -- I know the initial start to Maritza was a little bumpy. And how is that operation is doing now? And you had mentioned some issues in your Panama facility last year and what the status of that asset is as well?","Andres Gluski","Okay. I think both are doing well. So let's start up with Maritza. With me is Ned Hall, our COO role for the Generation Groups and give a little update on what's happening in Maritza.","Edward C. Hall","Maura, on October 7, we passed 600-megawatts test and then on December 30 of 2011, we achieved 690 megawatts of gross output. So we're fully commercial dispatching into the market. We have had a couple of outages to continue to improve the operations but it's operating under its PPA updated.","Andres Gluski","It's going well. I mean, there was even a coal miners strike in the midst of the winter in Bulgaria. We produced fully through out it. I think our Maritza operations are going well and we're getting paid. And now we're getting Panama, I'd like Andy to sort of give you update on some of, let's say, the repairs at Est\u00ed and just the general Panamanian markets.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Maura, this is Andy Vesey, excuse me. With Est\u00ed, just, and just to remind you on the call, this was the -- it's 120-megawatt running river plant in Panama. We suffered a tunnel collapse, the intake tunnels, repairs are underway. We're basically on target to return that to service in the early quarter second half of this year. So that continues to go well. We have some exposures there because we have PPAs that are recovering as Hydro plant and spot pricing was relatively high during the outage. But through business interruption insurance and negotiations, with the supportive Panamanian government, we\u2019ve managed to eliminate most of that exposure. So it's been relatively smooth to date. There's actually been some issues in Panama regarding indigenous protests, which has to do with certain legislation that President Martinelli has been moving forward, but it hasn't impacted our operations so as, again, we continue to believe we'll have that plant back in commercial operations by early second quarter of 2012.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","Great. Any update on the infamous Braziliana estate sale?","Andres Gluski","No. Not really. I think we're -- again, what I would report is that our relationship with BNDES is very good, and that we're really working hand-in-glove together and I think nothing succeeds like success. So I think that they have seen their investment and Braziliana is probably one of their best and they have received a lot of cash back through the sale of Atimus. So I think that's -- nothing new to report. But I would say that we feel very much -- that we have a good working relation with BNDES in terms of working together to create more value there.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","Great. And last question. Can you tell us a little bit more about this capital investment program? And you talked about changing compensation on project NPV and capital efficiency measures trying to drive better returns on invested capital? Can -- is there a return invested capital goal? Or what are you trying to do here? And how does it actually work?","Andres Gluski","Great question. What we've basically done -- I think, traditionally, we've been compensated on the basis of NPV created on new projects. And what we are changing is to not only have the NPV created, but what is the capital efficiency. So it's not the same to produce $100 million of NPV if it's going to require $300 million of corp equity in, as it's 0, right? So basically, the idea is to try to favor and get people more motivated to see ways that we can create NPV without requiring AES equity. And we think that's the way we're really going to improve our return on invested capital. Our return of invested capital in the last -- in the short term, we've had a number of impairments, and the like, in 8% to 9% range. I think we can do substantially better over time. This is not something -- this is -- we have a lot of assets, it's going to take a while to move it. But we think with this new focus -- what does that mean? That means, for example, if you have $1 billion of leverage capacity at Chiate [ph] that is a key way of improving returns to AES. It doesn't require any money. If you have, essentially, cash in India with our partner or the state of Orissa, which is not being utilized in OPGC, you've got to utilize it there. So you're absolutely right. We really haven't had a sort of -- say, what was going to go from, say, 9% to 12%, but we will be looking at this and seeing how fast we can change that. And just wanted to sort of complement. One area where we haven't -- we're looking at is, for example, what can we do with our renewables portfolio in the sense that we have about $1,250,000,000 invested, are there ways that we can unleash some of that value there, too?","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","And what does that mean?","Andres Gluski","What does that mean? Well, that means that that's one the focuses we have in terms of seeing how we can structure things differently to have better earnings from that invested portfolio right now.","Operator","Carlos Rodriguez.","Carlos Rodriguez","Hartford Investment Management. Victoria, I wanted to understand how to reconcile the guidance for 2012 subsidiary distributions? It looks like it was noted in the press release as $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion and then in the presentation, it looks like it's substantially higher than that. How do I reconcile those 2?","Victoria D. Harker","In the -- I'm sorry, which presentation?","Carlos Rodriguez","2012 guidance metrics on Page 17, subsidiary distributions, looks like $1.325 billion to $1.525 billion versus the press release -- looks like -- Oh, I'm sorry, that was the full year 2011 guidance. Apologize for that. Another question for you. The run rate expenses at the parent level, what are those running at right now?","Andres Gluski","It's about $300 million to $350 million.","Victoria D. Harker","And we have taken the metrics that you're looking at, assume that we will continue along the path of the $100 million reduction program, which is $100 million by the exit of 2013. So the $50 million that I had referred to, we will be generating over the span of 2012, and then another $50 million will be coming online after that.","Andres Gluski","And, Carlos, what I think is important is that we're really looking at just reducing expenditures in terms of the classification, some of it might cost of goods sold, et cetera. So what we're counting on is we are targeting $50 million for this year, and by the end of next year, we're having another $50 million. So if you thought of sort of the base of 2011, actually, you'll have a run rate of about $100 million.","Carlos Rodriguez","Okay. So $100 million run rate including the expense reductions at the parent level?","Andres Gluski","Yes.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And lastly, Andres, you talked about the core markets being Brazil, Chile and the U.S. with, I assume, the latter with the utilities focus in the U.S. Some of these growth markets that you've embarked on, perhaps under your previous leadership in the Philippines and India, how should we think about those in terms of the strategic nature of those? Are those sort of opportunistic growth projects? Or do you view those as core markets like you do Chile and Brazil and the U.S.?","Andres Gluski","Well, again, I think that the key -- when we say core, those are our largest markets, that's what our primary focus will be. If you look at the value of those -- basically, Gener, which includes Colombia as well, Brazil and the U.S., about 70% of the value of AES, so that's where our focus is going to be on. So you're right, I mean, we do have projects underway in places like Turkey and we have to see how this flow, let's say, develops. Do we really develop a compelling competitive advantage? In the case of the Philippines, we're very well positioned. We have been very successful in that market and we expect that we can add on to there and we have some of these other opportunities like in India. But you're right in the sense that our focus is going to on expanding platforms. We will execute on these other -- these upper growth markets that we have. We don't plan to enter any new markets that haven't been announced to date.","Operator","Raymond Leung.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, Goldman Sachs. A couple of questions. One, with respect to your comment on reaching a possible one notch upgrade target, can you sort of talk a little bit about what you're financial leverage targets are at the parent? Can you sort of give us an update what you guys are thinking there? And then also, can you talk about -- you've mentioned about $500 million of potential debt maturities. I know that is predicated on some asset sales, but can you talk about how you would go about that? It doesn't look like you have any significant maturities until 2014.","Victoria D. Harker","Yes. And we were -- just to be clear, I wasn't referring to maturities. We were talking about the expected use of cash, whether it be organic cash in the businesses or asset sale proceeds, depending on the timing of when those occur using $500 million for debt paydowns in the relative near-term, so over the span of 2012 and then into '13. So the sign of maturity driven is the use cash, where we think  that, that would be an improvement to our credit metrics, obviously, reducing interest costs as well. In terms of the ratios that we look at in terms of coverage, we have historically been in sort of the 3.5x to 4.5x, but we've got slightly higher than that in terms of DP&L acquisition when we raised about $2 billion. And so far, the intent is to debt paydown to get back to roughly that same 3.5x to 4.5x debt-to-cash ratio.","Andres Gluski","I think, Raymond, as is also seen, our paper tends to trade better than our credit rating. And the other -- over time, as we do these portfolio, let's say, sales of certain assets and growth and others, I also think that our -- the quality of our cash flow continues to improve.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as you think about credit ratings, is the double-Bs' sort of that optimal rating for you guys, then?","Andres Gluski","This is what we're saying over the medium term, yes. Today, we're talking about double-B. And I think, again, we expect to be trading better than that, but we also think it's -- the general perception of risk of AES.","Okay, with that, I want to thank everybody for being on the call, and the questions and I would like to turn it over to Ahmed.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you all for joining us in today's call. Please call us for any follow-up questions from this call, and we look forward to speaking to you. With that, I will ask Angie to close the call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Good morning. And welcome to our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our Web site at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; ","Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior management of our management team.","With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial review call. 2018 was a good year for AES, demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We delivered on all of our commitments, including our financial guidance and hit key milestones on our strategy positioning AES for long-term sustainable growth. Some of our key accomplishments last year were; we reached the high-end of our expected ranges for both earnings per share and free cash flow; we achieved a key investment grade financial metrics one year ahead of our plan; we met our expectation of signing long-term PPAs for 2 gigawatts of renewable capacity and increased our backlog to almost 6 gigawatts; we accomplished key milestones on our 4.4 gigawatts under construction and completed construction of an additional 1.3 gigawatts; we introduced a longer term target to reduce our carbon intensity by 70% from 2016 through 2020; we now expect to achieve a 50% reduction by 2022; and our world leading battery-based energy storage joint venture with Siemens, Fluence, was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects bringing this total to 766 megawatts.","Reflecting on our successful execution, improved visibility and increased confidence and our ability to deliver, we are extending our longer-term outlook by two years, and now expect 7% to 9% average annual growth in earnings and cash flow through 2022. As a result of our strong performance in 2018, combined with our improved outlook, we expect to hit the high-end of our prior guidance range through 2020. Gustavo will discuss our 2018 results and guidance in more detail after I provide an overview of our strategy.","Turning now to Slide 4. Our core strategy continues to revolve around the three themes of; first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio and lowering risk to deliver attractive returns; second, delivering on our backlog of long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth; and three, investing in cumulative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market leading position. Today, I will review the progress we've made this year in support of these themes and how we have positioned ourselves well for the future.","Turning to Slide 5, we are seeing the benefits of many initiatives that began several years ago to de-risk our portfolio. AES today is a very different company than it was in 2011, doing business in 28 countries around the world with significant commodity exposure. Since then we have focused our portfolio on roughly a dozen markets where we have a competitive advantage and we have reduced our overall exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology by 70%. In 2018 alone, we paid down $1 billion dollars in current debt, and we are on a path to attain investment grade ratings in 2020, supported not only by our financial metrics but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio. Our efforts to enhance the resilience of the portfolio have led us to focus increasingly on clean technologies.","As you can see on Slide 6, we are significantly decreasing the carbon intensity of our portfolio. In November, we announced the carbon intensity reduction target of 70% by 2030 versus 2016 levels. Today, I am pleased to announce an interim carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022. Our shift to renewables simply makes good business sense. It increases the longevity of our cash flows and allows us to attract a broader investor base. Another way we're decreasing the risk of our portfolio is by completing most of the large conventional projects under construction and focusing our future growth on renewable projects, which are less capital-intensive and considerably simpler to build.","Turning now to our strong backlog of projects, beginning with our progress on those under construction on Slide 7. In 2018, we completed 1.3 gigawatts of new projects, including the Eagle Valley combined cycle gas plant and IP&L in Indiana, and the AES Col\u00f3n combined cycle gas plant and re-gasification terminal in Panama, and 254 megawatts of solar and energy storage, mostly in the U.S.","We still have another 4.4 gigawatts currently under construction and expected to come online through 2021. Our OPGC2 to plant in India is in the commissioning phase and we expect it will be fully completed in May. Our south land repowering project in Southern California is approximately 80% complete, and the project is on track to come online in the first half of next year. And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now three quarters complete with two third of the tunneling work done. The remaining projects under construction are made up of renewables across our portfolio.","As you can see on Slide 9, this capacity is split equally between the U.S. and internationally. All of these projects are going well and they are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we've been able to transition these projects from development to construction. Since our last call in November, we have broken ground on 721 megawatts of solar, wind and energy storage.","As can be seen on Slide 10, in 2018, we signed new PPAs for approximately 2 gigawatts of renewables, and we're on track to sign between 2 gigawatts and 3 gigawatts annually in the coming years.","Turning to Slide 11, combining our capacity under construction with our long-term PPAs that are not yet under construction, yields our total backlog to 5.8 gigawatts. As we execute on our plan to sign 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year, we expect to bring a total of 12 gigawatts online by 2022. By then, we project that the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about one third today.","As can be seen on Slide 12, our renewable investments are expected to produce close to high teen IRRs across all our market assuming conservative terminal values. We have some unique advantages that allow us to earn these attractive returns, which I'll discuss in the next few slides.","Beginning on Slide 13, first, we have existing commercial relationships that we can leverage to drive new growth. For example, our green blend and extend strategy allows us to negotiate new long-term PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers. Through this win-win strategy, we preserve some value of our existing thermal capacity contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long-term contracted renewable energy. In exchange, our customers receive carbon free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation.","In 2018 alone, we negotiated green blend and extend contracts for 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. A second advantage that we have for renewable growth is deep market intimacy. For example, AES Distributed Energy recently inaugurated the largest solar storage facility in the world, the island of Kauai. The deposit was made possible by AES's long history in Hawaii and willingness to work with local stakeholders to meet their needs and goals. The project which includes 100 megawatt hours of 5 hour duration energy storage will essentially serve as a source of base load power for the island and deliver roughly 11% of its power. We recently broke ground on a similar second project also on the Island of Hawaii with 14 megawatts of solar and 70 megawatt hours of 5 hour duration energy storage.","Third, our work with partners provides us with an important competitive advantage. We bring in partners to achieve economies of scale, fine-tune our portfolio and improve our returns on invested capital. Our recent sell down of sPower is a good example where we agreed to sell 48% of our stake in sPower's operating portfolio, which along with operational improvements and refinancing have increased our returns to 13%. The sell down also provides us with funds to invest in sPower's 10 gigawatt development pipeline to earn similar attractive returns.","Turning now to Slide 16. In addition to our growth in renewable, we continue to increase our LNG business, which is displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. As you may know, in 2018, we inaugurated our AES Col\u00f3n combined cycle gas plant and LNG regasification facility in Panama, which will play a key role in supplying natural gas for the entire Central American region. Our LNG facilities in Panama and the Dominican Republic represent a total install capacity of 150 tera BTUs to serve local and regional markets. The majority of this capacity is now under contract and the remaining 55 tera BTUs are still available to drive future growth.","As I mentioned on our last call, we are capitalizing on the expertise we have gained in the Dominican Republic and Panama by developing a similar LNG regasification facility and associated combined cycle power plant in Vietnam. Although, this long-term U.S. dollar denominated 450 tera BTU facility is in its early stages, we are making very good progress and it has a potential to contribute significantly to our longer-term growth for 2023.","Turning to Slide 17. The third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market-leading position. As an example, in 2007, AES launched a small energy storage group that was the first of its kind. Today energy storage is beginning to revolutionize the sector and AES is at the forefront. Fluence, our JV with Siemens, was recently named the number one utility scale energy storage integrator in the world by Navigant Research for the third time in a row. In 2018, Fluence was awarded 286 megawatts of new projects and is now the largest global energy storage provider by capacity in the world with a total of 80 projects in 17 countries.","Turning to Slide 18, we're also implementing a corporate wide digital transformation, including becoming a strategic investor in Simple Energy. Simple Energy provides a digital platform that allows our IP&L the DP&L utilities to accelerate energy efficiency and demand response program, all the while improving customer experience. Simple Energy's digital platform serves not only AES's utilities, but 40 other utilities in the U.S. with access to over 40 million end customers. Although, not in our guidance, we expect our new digital initiatives to materially benefit both our top and bottom line. We will provide more color as our digital strategy matures on future calls.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, 2019 guidance and longer-term expectations in more detail.","Gustavo Pimenta","Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Today, I will go over our 2018 results, including credit profile and capital allocation. I will conclude by addressing our guidance for this year and expectations through 2022.","As Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we finished 2018 on a strong note, achieving the upper end of our expected ranges for all metrics and setting a solid foundation for growth through 2022. As shown on the Slide 20, adjusted EPS was $1.24, reflecting higher margins from our businesses, particularly in the U.S. and utilities and South America's strategic business units or SBUs, as well as debt pay down at the parent. These positive drivers were partially offset by asset sales in the Philippines and Kazakhstan.","Turning to Slide 21, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $1.2 billion for the year, an increase of $160 million. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 22. In the U.S. and utilities SBUs, higher PTC was primarily driven by DPL, which benefited from higher rates following the resolution of its rate case. Results also reflect high contributions from our U.S. solar business and an extended summer run at our Southland plant in California. Increased PTC at our South America SBU reflects higher contracted pricing in Colombia, as well as higher tariffs in Argentina following the 2017 results.","Results also benefited from higher contracted sales and lower interest expense at AES Gener in Chile. Higher PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, or MCC SBU reflects a full year of operations at the DPP combined cycle expansion and higher spot energy prices in the Dominican Republic. Results also reflect the commencement of operations at the AES Col\u00f3n CCGT and regasification facility and improving hydrology in Panama. Finally, in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and Kazakhstan.","Turning to our improving credit profile on Slide 26. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016, we have reduced the parent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. This includes an additional $150 million repayment in December 2018, which is an acceleration of the debt reduction we had anticipated through 2020. As a result, we achieved a key investment grade financial metric of 3.95 times to parent leverage, one year ahead of plan, providing us additional confidence in our ability to attain investment grade ratings in 2020.","We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years, we expect that our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our current free cash flow, as well as modest additional delivering.","Now to our 2018 parent capital allocations on Slide 27. Sources on the left hand side reflect $1.9 billion of total discretionary cash generated in 2018, consistent with our prior expectations. This includes $689 million of parent free cash flow just above the high-end of our expected range. Uses on the right-hand side of the slide are also largely in line with our prior disclosures. The one notable exception is our $1.3 billion of cash allocated to parent debt reduction, which reflects the additional $150 million paid down in the fourth quarter.","Now turning to our guidance on Slide 28. To-date, we are initiating guidance for 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.28 to $1.40. Growth this year will be largely driven by contributions from new projects and the cost savings. More specifically, we expected to benefit from the completion of most of our large thermal construction projects with expected commencement of operations at OPGC2 in the next few weeks and the first full-year of operations at AES Col\u00f3n in Panama; growth in renewable, including 1.4 gigawatts scheduled to reach commercial operations this year; a full-year of contributions from the cost savings implemented in 2018; lower currency and interest expense due to completed and continued debt reduction, and a slightly lower effective tax rate of 29% to 31%.","This growth will be partially offset by announced business exit in the Philippines, the Netherlands and Oklahoma. To-date, we are also providing our outlook of 7% to 9% EPS and cash flow growth through 2022. We have extended this outlook by two years, which reflects improving confidence in our backlog and increased visibility of earnings and cash flow. One additional point regarding our longer-term outlook; the 7% to 9% growth rate, which is off a 2018 base is in line with hitting the high-end of our previous 8% to 10% growth of a 2017 base through 2020.","Consistent with our prior expectations, growth in the outer years is expected to be driven by projects currently under construction, which is Southland, the allocation of parent cash to global renewables growth, and increasing LNG sales in MCEC. I would also note the couple of additional business related assumptions embedded in our longer-term outlook.","First, regarding Maritza in Bulgaria. The plant continues to be dispatched in pace in a timely manner. Discussions related to our PPA are still in early stages and we are working to reach a mutually acceptable resolution. As discussed before, our outlook is resilient to any reasonably likely outcome. Second, we continue to see our U.S. utilities is well-positioned for future rate based investment in T&D infrastructure. IPL has grown it's rate base over the last few years. And going forward, there are these two opportunities for growth in the mid-single digits.","At DPL where the focus has been on restructuring the business, we pursue growth in the high single-digits. To that end, since our last call, DPL has filed both its grid modernization plan and BMI extension. Together these filings aim to maintain DPLs financial integrity, while bringing its customers the substantial benefits associated with the robust modernizing electric grid. Our guidance assumes that BMI extended for two years from late 2020 through late 2022, allowing the company to meet its financial obligations, while repaying the ability to grow its asset base through its marketable investments.","Turning to Slide 29, parent free cash flow is expected to be from $700 million to $750 million this year, and it is also expected to grow 7% to 9% per year through 2022. Now to 2019 current capital allocation on Slide 30. Beginning on the left-hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash, including $725 million of current free cash flow. Sources also include $320 million in asset sales proceeds with 107 in proceeds to the current from announced sell-down of sPower's operating portfolio, and a placeholder for an additional $150 million this year.","Now to the uses on the right-hand side, including the 5% dividend increase we announced in the December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect it to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt, largely to strengthen our investment grade metrics, and we plan to invest over $400 million in our subsidiaries leaving about $100 million on unallocated cash. Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2019 through 2022, beginning on the Slide 31. We expected our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is more than 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from current free cash flow. The rest comes from our $2 billion asset sales target, $1.4 billion of which is completed or announced.","Turning to the use of the discretionary cash on Slide 32. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the Board, we expect that the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We expect to use $300 million for this production, including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the final asset sales. We are planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used to create shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. 2018 was a very good year for AES as demonstrated by our strong financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals.","We are on track to attain investment grade rating in 2020. We are completing our conventional construction projects. We are signing long-term PPAs for renewables, including successfully implementing green blend and extend through our backlog. Going forward, we will invest our growing free cash flow in a robust growth pipeline, while maintaining the strength of our balance sheet and our competitive dividend. Accordingly, combining our annual growth and current dividend yield, we expect to deliver double digit total returns to our shareholders through 2022.","Operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. The first question will come from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Q - Ali Agha","First question to start with Andr\u00e9s, just again coming back to the basic assumptions underlying your '18 to '22 growth, to be clear on some of the comments you've made with regards to Bulgaria. Are you assuming that you continue to own that project through the full-year period and that the current economics stay where they are. It wasn\u2019t quite clear what's baked into the assumption with Bulgaria, and then also related to that on the Ohio distribution rider. Can you give us some further thinking and your confidence level on why you think you will get the extension beyond 2020? Just in terms of any commentary or any conversations with the commission that would be helpful.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","On Bulgaria, Bulgaria is in our forecast. As we said, our guidance is robust to any reasonably likely outcome there. So we feel confident in our guidance. It does conclude Bulgaria. As been said, conversations are in the very early stages. We think we have a very strong case. And certainly the plant is necessary for Bulgaria. It provides a lot of jobs locally, especially if you include the mining sector. So, yes, it's included. But our guidance is robust to any reasonably likely outcome.","Regarding DP&L and the rider, I mean, basically what I can tell you, is that this has to do with company achieving investment-grade. The company has plans for grid modernization, grid resilience. And we think those elements are necessary and likely to remain. So basically the outlook for DP&L in terms of improving the quality of new services is good and the monetization rider is part of that.","Ali Agha","And then second question, just to clarify the fact that you're running at the higher end of your near term '17 through '20. Would you attribute that to faster than expected success in your renewable strategy? Or what's driving you to that higher end at least in the near term?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I would say all of the above. I think we've been very successful on cost cuts. I think we've been very successful on the green blend and expense strategy. And as I mentioned in my speech, we're very pleased by how we've been able to transition projects from development into construction on the renewable side. So it's all of the above.","Gustavo Pimenta ","I'll still add, Ali, the LNG sale which is accelerating, so that's another important element of that guidance that we are providing. ","Ali Agha ","And last question. I just wanted to be clear on the sources and uses that you've laid out as you fund this CapEx through 2022. Just to be very clear. You're not assuming or you don't see a need for external equity to support this program. The internal cash flow and asset sales should fund all your needs to support the backlog and the growth through 2022. Am I correct in that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","You are correct. So this is an unambiguous yes. The program is such that between our internally generated cash flow, including some asset sales, we fully fund our program and pay the dividends and also some modest debt pay down as well. So this does not assume any additional equity.","Operator","The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So I just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on the backlog and the capital allocation commitment. Just want to be a little clear about this or perhaps quite clear, both '19 and through the '22 outlook. How are you thinking about the net income contribution from the renewables growth as it stands today? You've got $1.5 billion and broadly allocated and again I know that's not necessarily all for the renewables business. But how are you thinking about renewables' contribution specifically year-over-year into '19 and through '22 from the plan and\/or what you've contracted today? However you want to characterize that.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, let me stand in big picture. Big picture is we have considerable capital tied-up in construction projects, which we will be cutting the ribbon from now through 2021. In many cases, we have contributed all of the capital that we need to contribute. So, most of our growth is coming from organic projects and just cutting the ribbon. So I want that to be perfectly clear. Second, you have to remember in our renewables program, half of this is outside the U.S. and the half that\u2019s in the U.S., about 40% is win. So the contribution, for example, of HLBV is so far negligible, and it's not as big for us as it is for other people going forward. So in terms of the growth, as I said, a big contributor to this is the organic growth coming from the projects we have completed. In addition to the megawatts that I've mentioned, for example, we have completed the storage tank in Panama, which is going to happen about the middle of this year. So we have additional projects coming online from there. So with that I can pass it off to Gustavo but I want to make absolutely unambiguous that we have very strong organic growth coming on. And given the distribution of our growth, you don't have things like HLBV outside of the U.S.?","Gustavo Pimenta","So if you look at our 7% to 9% approximate 60% of that is just the materialization and reaching COD, especially the large thermal projects, Southland, OPGC, full year of follow-on and so on. The 40% is from the renewable space. Out of which half is internationally is in the U.S., so it\u2019s not a major contributor yet for earnings. And I think one way to see that is our proportional -- our current free cash flow is also growing at the similar rate 7% to 9% for the same period.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to make sure I understand this. So for '19, because I appreciate that HLBV nuance and just the timing in-service, renewable contribution is fairly limited to growth. But as you say 40% of the overall 7% to 9% roughly, call it may be little bit less than $150 million of net income growth, is coming from renewables by the end of the '22 period?","Gustavo Pimenta","Yes, and that's global renewable. So as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, half of that 40%, call it 20%, is internationally, which doesn\u2019t have that affect. And the local one then you have 40%, which is win and then the rest is solar. So it's a subset of the 40% at the end.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just want to clarify one more nuance detail here. That 40% for renewable, that's relative to what investment in renewables. What you've contracted thus far or what the cumulative plan entails? I just want to make sure we're specific there?","Gustavo Pimenta","It's the cumulative, yes. What we have expected throughout the period.","Operator","The next question will come from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","So first on your credit metrics. Can give us a sense where credit agencies are now that you have reached the investment grade metrics? And also you are just showing that this one metric. Can you comment about FFO to debt or net debt-to-EBITDA what those metrics are? And again, mostly because I'm trying to gauge when we should expect upgrade to the current rating?","Gustavo Pimenta","So our base case is to get the metric in 2020. So it continues to be the case. We just started our process with the agencies. They are supportive. They've seen all of the efforts that was done in terms of reducing the leverage. From an FFO to debt, we are closing '18 at 18.8%, 20% is above the threshold. So that is why you see in our capital allocation another $150 million. I think what is more important is that from a capital allocation standpoint, most of the heavy lifting has been done. So we've paid down close to $1 billion of debt last year. So what is remaining in the plan is it's a relatively small amount, but rate agencies will take their time. So we are still expecting the actual action on the rating to be taken early next year 2020.","Angie Storozynski","Secondly, so in you press release you talk about this additional sell down of your stake in sPower. Is this -- I mean I remember that you guys mentioned that Tom is working on some systemic or structured relationships with a party that could take future ownership of operating assets. Is this what it is? Or are we still waiting for an announcement and it's still scheduled for roughly mid of this year?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, this is not part of that. And as we've said in the past, Tom will be working on the more systematic way of getting partnership money into our projects. And stay tuned, at the right time, we will explain this. But this is -- as I said, we've done $3 billion of partnership capital over the past five years. And so this is an extension of that.","Angie Storozynski","And then my last question, I remember you made comment about your dividends, the competitive dividend. Once you actually pay down all the debt that is required to the people of the credit agencies. I mean should we expect that the dividend growth will be commensurate with the earnings growth?","Gustavo Pimenta","I think again so stay tuned. We said that we would have competitive dividend growth. And so this is approved annually by the board. So stay tuned. But we're in that 4% to 6% ranges, which is the industry average. So we should expect this to be within the 4% to 6% range within the site, within the four year period, and really validated by the board. So 4% to 6% is what we should expect.","Operator","The next question will come from Greg Gordon of Evercore.","Greg Gordon","Just to circle back to couple of the original questions. You said that -- is your plan also resilient to potentially not getting the BMR extended by two years. So as we think about 7% to 9% growth rate, while you're assuming that you do get the extension if you were to not get the extension, which is still be inside of growth rate?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","What I'd say is look we have we think a very robust plan. It's taking any potential downside. We have a number of potential upside. So certainly, we could have faster growth, for example, of our LNG sales, which are very attractive because we basically made the capital investments. So there's certainly a potential market there for that. Second, as I mentioned in my speech, we really haven\u2019t incorporated all of the potential benefits from our digital transformation. So that has been a significant amount of cost cuts. I think we have a very good track record of over delivering on cost cuts. But it also has significant revenue potential. So as we don't like to talk about these things until we really have them in hand. So when I look at that, this is a robust plan given I think that any potential downsides or offset with potential upside and these potential upsides are quite concrete, we feel. So stay tuned.","Greg Gordon","And there was no mention of the preexisting cost-cutting initiatives in this slide deck. I shouldn't presume that there's has been any change?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, there hasn\u2019t. And in fact we remain on track.","Gustavo Pimenta","So the plan has been fully executed last year. So we are getting in '19 run rate savings of $100 million, which was with what we had disclosed it before, so in line with prior disclosures.","Greg Gordon","And the $2 billion asset sell target is still in place, but you extended the overall guidance framework to '22. Does that imply that the asset, the pace of the asset sales is slowed or do you still expect to have the majority of those asset sales completed by 2020?","Gustavo Pimenta","I'd say by 2020 we'll complete the $2 billion what we expect, that's part of this plan. Going forward, we will continue to fine-tune our portfolio. So there may be additional sales but as part of the portfolio. So they may not be wholly exiting, they may be like we did it as far selling down a portion and reinvesting that money and higher return. So that remains part of our modus operandi going forward.","Greg Gordon","No, I get that, completely understood. I just wanted to make sure the pre-existing targets were still haven\u2019t slept and the answer to that is no they haven't\u2026","Gustavo Pimenta","No, pre-existing targets, not at all. We feel very confident about them. And we expect to execute on that.","Greg Gordon","And then on the targets for the renewables growth, they are quite robust. And it's a little bit of a blend and extend in that and then in your prior guidance, you had targeted 3,000 megawatts for '19. Now you're targeting 2,500. But you're targeting and consistent execution over a longer period of time. And you have a higher end exit rate, exit number in terms of total aspirational growth in renewables. What should we look for over the course of this year to see that you're hitting your targets, because there was a bit of a deceleration in wins when we look at what you've executed in Q3 and Q4 of '18?","Gustavo Pimenta","Greg, this has to do just with the timing of the signing of the PPAs. There has been no, from our point of view, no let's say feeling that we're going slower than we were previously. It's just a little bit of timing and making sure that we have these PPAs signed before we commence construction. So the way you can make sure that we're on track is just we will have the announcements of the growth, the milestones that we hit throughout the quarter. So again, green blend and extend has shown itself to be very robust, and we're actually doing very well there. And certainly our distributed LNG as the announcements we've had in Hawaii and other places, it is very robust. So, no, we really don't feel that we're decelerating. It's just a question of the timing, which these projects are going to come in.","Operator","The next question will come from Christopher Turnure of JP Morgan.","Christopher Turnure","I want to follow-up on some of the renewable financing comments that you've made so far. Just overall could you give us thoughts on how that effort is going? I don\u2019t know if Tom is on the call or not. But where you are seeing the lowest costs, both in the U.S. and globally? And then your slide on the IRRs for renewables. Does that assume that you are tax efficient or does that take into consideration any tax inefficiency that you have?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Let me see, so that\u2019s multiple questions. Let' see. So first, Tom is not on the call. And what is assumed in these numbers is that tax efficiency, and what is assumed is, for example, I'd say mainly in the U.S. where we actually sell down a portion once it reaches operations and optimize it for operational and financial efficiency. So that's I'd say basically it. I think in the rest of the world, what we're seeing especially for example in South America and in Mexico is really the green blend and extend project itself. Again, you don't have a HLBV, you don\u2019t have ITC, you don\u2019t have some of the other elements that you have in the state that make it, let's say, a little bit more complicated accounting and less transparent to see through. So I would say it's basically that. We will continue to do what we've done. So we think this is very credible. We've done this and we will going forward. And different markets are progressing at different speeds. We certainly see that the combination of solar energy storage is coming into being and that\u2019s an area where we have we think a real competitive advantage.","Christopher Turnure","And then just going back to the IRR comment that you made. Does that mean that the numbers on that particular slide are hypothetical and your actual returns are lower than that? Or do those numbers take into consideration everything?","Gustavo Pimenta","This is actual IRR, so cash-on-cash, so this is not ROE it's actually IRR. So that's cash-on-cash real return.","Christopher Turnure","And then just to follow-up to I think one of the earlier balance sheet questions. You mentioned that a year from now roughly is when you're thinking agencies might come back to the table here and revisit your ratings. Could you give us any color on how your discussions on business risks are going within that overall discussion?","Gustavo Pimenta","Yes, sure. That's I think one of the upside and one of the positive feedback that we get. I think we continue to be a diversified portfolio, which is important for them but more focused on markets with lower risk. So I think from that perspective, we get very good feedback from their agencies and it's an important component of our trajectory here. It's not only a question of the quality of our portfolio. So I did mention in my speech that, measurably our risks are down 70% over the last five years, to make very big something like Panama where we have 777 megawatts of hydro. In a dry year, we would be forced to buy in the market and therefore, energy would be high, energy to supply our contracts that are contracted. And now with Col\u00f3n in place and natural gas coming into Panama, we have such that particular risk by about 80%. So the quality of the portfolio is backing up the numbers. I think that\u2019s very, very important. In fact, what's underlying the subsidiaries our investment grade as well and we feel there's hydrology commodity FX risk is very much. So it's not just the metric itself, I think it's a quality of those metrics.","Christopher Turnure","So it sounds like you're pretty much there in terms of the business mix and your improvement, you just need to maybe execute for a couple more quarters to get that recognized?","Gustavo Pimenta","That\u2019s exactly right. Yes, we think there's a seasoning that those agencies will require, but we feel pretty good of path we are on. And we feel very good that our business mix continues to improve the quality of the portfolio.","Operator","The next question will come from Gregg Orrill of UBS.","Gregg Orrill","Regarding the 24% sell down and sPower, what's the impact there on returns or earnings of sPower, how are you thinking about that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I don\u2019t think we want to specifically discuss that amount. But obviously, once you have operating assets up and running under long-term contracts, there're other people who are willing to or interested in owning those assets for the long-term at less returns than you'd get when you are the originator, developer and constructor of those projects.","Gustavo Pimenta","I think what I've been saying, Greg, when we bought its how we bought at high-single digits. So after the acquisition we secure the refinancing, the operational includes maintenance so on plus those sell downs we've brought this to 13%. That is just part of that value creation that we're able to conduct.","Operator","The next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman","Just on the Ohio DMR, could you just remind me how much earnings come from that?","Gustavo Pimenta","Today we have $105 pretax, so $105 million per year\u2026","Steve Fleishman","And are you tying the two cases such that if you're not going to be getting that in the future, if they don\u2019t extend it, you are not going to be able to commit to grow the investment in the grid?","Gustavo Pimenta","That's right. I mean, they two work together so we need -- we believe it's important to have the DMR for us to be able to continue the transformation of DPL including these markets with investments.","Steve Fleishman","And the just on your -- you might have answered this. But just how would you characterize your returns on new renewable growth projects in U.S. relative to that 13% that you are now up to on sPower acquisition?","Gustavo Pimenta","I think we have a different project in the U.S. We have project -- several AES distributed energy projects then we have sPower projects, we have C&I customers, we still have some deal in the works. We have deals where we're really combining energy storage in new. So there is a range depending on the particular niche, let' say, I would say that we're addressing. I would say to -- and again I would also say that you when we characterize these returns, this is just the project return that we're looking and not any leverage at corp or anything above. And we were very conservative I'd say about terminal value. But obviously in the plain-vanilla in the U.S., it does involve that we would flip portion of the operating assets to some long-term holder other than ourselves. So there is that combination. But we do have this mix, so it's not like a uniform product that we are selling across the states.","Steve Fleishman","And then one last question just on -- I thought I saw somewhere that you might have won storage project with Arizona with APS. And I don\u2019t know -- I didn\u2019t see that in your -- could you talk about that, and it seem to be pretty sure?","Gustavo Pimenta","It's a 100 megawatt four our energy storage, so it's 400 megawatts hours. This is quite frankly exactly the size of the one that we have on Alamitos that we're building today. And so as you put those two together, we have two projects of 100 megawatts to four hours each that would be 200 megawatts, 800 megawatts hours between the two projects.","Steve Fleishman","But that's not in what you announced as of the year end, that would be additive?","Gustavo Pimenta","That's correct, that's not in 2018 numbers.","Operator","The next question will come from the Charles Fishman of Morningstar Research. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","If I can just follow-up on Steve's question. So with Fluence, end of the year award and delivered 766, if I my math is right versus I think at the third quarter it was 701. So 65 megawatts were added during the fourth quarter. What specifically was that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Fluence is a JV between us and Siemens. But Fluence own sales team is doing quite a lot. So they're in 17 countries with 80 projects. The projects vary from smaller projects. It can be 500 KV or a multiple of them, smaller units 500 KV one megawatt but the larger units as large as the 800 megawatt hours. So honestly I don't have off the top of my head, which of those projects are. But realized we're hitting everybody from C&I customers to the very largest utilities and everything in between. So it's a mix of product. And the large ones tend to be a bit lumpy, but we like very much of the smaller projects that come in. And we increased the number of countries around the world. One thing that\u2019s probably we at AES together with Mitsubishi inaugurated India's first energy storage project last week in Delhi and this together with Tata Power. And this project is I think very important for India, because it establishing how energy storage would work on that grid and getting the regulations in place. And as you know India has -- it is actually building out 200 gigawatts of renewables, probably 80s I think are in the bag. And they are going to need a whole lot of energy storage to be able to accommodate that much renewables on their grid. So there's a lot of interesting markets opening-up.","Charles Fishman","And we'll see this number order and delivered jump when you report first quarter, because of APS?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","As I said, there will be lumpiness as these projects come in.","Charles Fishman","And one other question Andr\u00e9s, I want to make sure I got this right. You said that by -- I believe you said that by 2022, 50% of your PTC coming from the SBUs will be U.S. generated. Was that correct?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","There is course, especially when you have renewables with shorter time frames that are rolling in terms of -- this will be rolling overtime we have to win some of those bids. But yes, given our current expectations is a little less than half will be U.S. and that's up from about a third today. So the proportion of our pretax contributions coming from the U.S. should rise overtime given our expectations for where that growth is coming from. Obviously, we have like Southland coming online. We have a number of projects in Hawaii. You mentioned the APS. So we've signings certainly in terms of megawatts, lot of big projects in the state. You also have the investments -- future investments in the DP&L as well. So we have great visibility into a strong pipeline of growth in the U.S.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you everybody for joining us on today's call.

Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Ryan. Good morning and welcome to AES\u2019s First Quarter 2017 Financial Review Call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our financial results and provide updates on our strategy to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. ","Since our most recent call in late February, we have made significant progress on a number of key objectives for 2017. We advanced our construction program, which will be the major contributor to our cash flow and earnings growth over the next four years. We capitalized on our existing platforms to further enhance future growth by targeting long-term US dollar-denominated contracts.","We have taken steps to decrease our covenant intensity and merchant exposure. These steps will reduce our financial and operational risk. We continued our efforts to strengthen our credit profile by prepaying $300 million of Parent debt. This also increases Parent free cash flow by lowering interest expense.","We are on track to achieve our $400 million per year cost reduction and revenue enhancement program. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in a moment, but first I would like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4. ","In the first quarter, we earned $0.17 of adjusted EPS versus the $0.15 we earned in the same period last year. We generated $546 million of consolidated free cash flow, $56 million higher than last year. Based on our first quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for all metrics.","Now I would like to turn to our strategic accomplishments. As you can see on Slide 5, we have 3.4 gigawatts under construction and expect it to come online through 2019. Overall, we have achieved significant progress on all of these projects. ","Turning to Alto Maipo on Slide 6, as you may recall Alto Maipo is an expansion of our existing Alfalfal plant in Chile. As we discussed on our last call, the project has been experiencing tunneling challenges resulting in cost overruns estimated in the range of 10% to 20%. Over the past couple of months, we have made significant progress on this project.","First, we have secured additional financing commitment for up to 22% of the project cost equivalent to $460 million including contingencies, of which $117 million will be funded by AES Gener and the remaining $343 million will be funded by the project lenders main contractor and minority partner. Second, Alto Maipo is now about 52% complete and we remain on track to reach COD in 2019. ","Turning to Slide 7, at our Eagle Valley, CCGT in Indiana, the EPC contractor is sub-contracting some of the work in an effort to accelerate the recovery plan. On our February call, we\u2019ve revised the completion date for this project to the first half of 2018. ","However, the EPC contractor is projecting substantial completion before year end 2017. Although any delay is unfortunate, we have a fixed price contract with the EPC contractor under which they are incentivized to finish the project in a timely manner. The CCGT has achieved several important EPC milestones, and we expect first fire to occur in the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 8, in our 1320 megawatt OPGC 2 project in India, we continued to make steady progress on construction and the project is expected to come online by the end of 2018. ","Finally, turning to Slide 9 and Col\u00f3n in Panama. I am pleased to report that we have reached a number of milestones on our Col\u00f3n CCGT and LNG regasification facility in Panama. The LNG facility is efficient to handle 80 Terrra BTU annually. ","Our CCGT will use about one quarter of the tank\u2019s capacity leaving substantial upside potential to meet the fuel needs of additional power plants, ship bunkering services, and downstream commercial and industrial customers. ","We will continue to focus on providing a cleaner, more cost-effective alternatives to oil-fueled power generation while at the same time satisfying a growing need for natural gas in Central America and the Caribbean. ","To that end, on Friday, we announced that we have entered into a joint venture with ENGIE to market and sell LNG from our Panamanian LNG terminal to third parties in Central America. This joint venture will help us monetize the tank\u2019s remaining capacity as additional LNG is sold using our terminal. It also further strengthens the agreement we signed last year to jointly market LNG in the Caribbean from our Andres regasification facility in the Dominican Republic.","With ENGIE as our partner, and both Colon and Andres online, in 2019, we will have the leading position in Central America and in the Caribbean\u2019s LNG regasification market. ","Turning to Slide 10, as you know, we are the world leader in battery-based energy storage. We currently have 394 megawatts in operation, under construction, or in late-stage development not including the 82 megawatt of our advanced energy storage platform that we have sold to third-parties. ","Since February, we have delivered 37.5 megawatts of four hour duration storage, the largest lithium ion energy storage installation in the world, the San Diego Gas and Electric. Following our successful commissioning of this project, San Diego Gas and Electric has awarded us another 40 megawatts four hour duration project.","Although energy storage has significant potential for growth, at this point, we have not assumed any material contributions in our outlook. ","Turning now to Slide 11 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives. This year, we are merging our Europe and Asia strategic business units which will drive significant savings. We are also continuing the work we began last year on standardization and improved sourcing and reliability. These initiatives put us on track to achieve $50 million of incremental annual benefits in 2017 and to hit our $400 million annual savings target by 2020.","Now turning to our continuing efforts to reshape our portfolio beginning on Slide 12. As we have discussed on our recent calls, we have been repositioning our portfolio towards businesses that are less carbon-intensive and have long-term US dollar-denominated contracts.","This repositioning is a key element of our strategy to reduce the risk of our portfolio. This year, we have already announced our plan to sell or shutdown 3.7 gigawatts of merchant coal-fired generation in Kazakhstan and Ohio. This is 26% of our total coal-fired capacity and 70% of our merchant coal-fired capacity.","Specifically, we divested 1.7 gigawatts of coal-fired generation in Kazakhstan for net proceeds of $24 million. With this sale, our only remaining assets in Kazakhstan are two plants with 1 gigawatt of hydro capacity, which are under concession that expires in the fourth quarter of this year. We expect to exit Kazakhstan following the expiration of this concession.","We have already announced the shutdown of 1.3 gigawatts of merchant, coal-fired capacity at DPL. Subsequently, we\u2019ve also agreed to sell an additional 739 megawatts of DPL owned generation for $50 million in net proceeds. Although the Kazakhstan and Ohio merchant coal sales appear to have low value on a per kilowatt basis, on a PE basis, we managed to achieve a multiple of roughly nine times. ","We will continue to update you as we make progress on additional asset sales to further reshape our portfolio. ","Turning to new businesses. Slide 13 provides an update on our Southland Repowering in California. As a reminder, we were awarded 20 year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1384 megawatts of capacity which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1284 megawatts of combining cycled gas capacity. ","Last month, we received final environmental approval for the project. We are on track for financial close and to begin construction by mid-2017 with completion of the gas-fired capacity in 2020 and the energy storage capacity in 2021. We anticipate funding the $2.3 billion in total project cost with a combination of non-recourse debt and approximately $400 million in equity proceeds from AES. ","Turning to Slide 14 and our pending acquisition of sPower. We continue to see the potential for adding 500 megawatts to 1 gigawatts of renewable contracted power annually with attractive low double-digit IRR. Furthermore, we see an opportunity to capitalize on the development skills of the sPower team to tap into the growing market for renewable PPA for large corporate and incorporating energy storage on their platforms. ","We received the FERC approval for the transaction last month and expect to receive the remaining approvals and close no later than the third quarter. ","As you can see on Slide 15, we are also making progress on renewable in Mexico, and Brazil. In Mexico, we were awarded exclusivity to negotiate 25 year US dollar-denominated PPA with private offtakers to build a 306 megawatt wind project and a 60 megawatt co-generation plant. ","These are our first Greenfield developments in Mexico in many years and we see a number of other good growth opportunities in light of the market reforms implemented by the Mexican government.","Lastly, we signed the acquisition of the 386 megawatts, Alto de Sert\u00e3o wind farm in Brazil that we announced on our last call. This project will help diversify Tiet\u00ea\u2019s fuel mix and hydrological risk. With an average remaining contract life of 18 years, the project will also help to reduce future exposure to short-term price movements.","This 600 million Real acquisition is being funded entirely with debt capacity at Tiet\u00ea demonstrating once again our ability to utilize local debt capacity in order to grow our business and improve returns. ","Turning to Slide 16, this brings us to our portfolio, which we expect to generate 8% to 10% average annual growth in all of our key financial metrics through 2020. This growth is largely driven by the completion of our projects under construction, our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives, lower interest expense, as we continue to delever, and attractive returns from recent acquisitions and our development pipeline. ","We see further upside potential if we are able to capitalize on the LNG and energy storage opportunities I discussed earlier. ","Turning to Slide 17, our portfolio will generate $3.8 billion in discretionary cash through 2020. This is largely driven by Parent free cash flow and the proceeds from asset sales. This internally generated discretionary cash is sufficient for us to meet our dividend growth commitment to fund our growth platform and reduce our corporate debt to achieve our strategic objectives.","Overall, we remain confident that we can deliver attractive growth to our shareholders through 2020 and beyond. ","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail. ","Thomas O'Flynn","Thanks Andr\u00e9s, and good morning. Today, I will review our first quarter results and 2017 capital allocation. Overall, we had a solid quarter benefiting from higher margins at many of our SBUs and lower tax rates. We also generated strong free cash flow and made good progress on Parent debt reduction. ","Turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 19, first quarter results of $0.17, a $0.02 increase from 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the tax rate, which was lower than first quarter 2016 rate, but higher than our expectation for full year 2017. Operations were relatively steady as benefit from a legal settlement in Brazil and foreign currency appreciation were largely offset by lower contributions at DPL in Ohio.","Before moving on, I want to touch on $168 million impairment charges again this quarter that are not included in adjusted EPS. Almost all of this is related to the exit of merchant coal assets that Andr\u00e9s mentioned namely, the 1.7 gigawatt sale in Kazakhstan and the planned shutdown of our 1.2 gigawatt Killen and Stuart plants at DPL in Ohio. ","Now to Slide 20 and our consolidated free cash flow and adjusted PTC. We generated $546 million of consolidated free cash flow, an increase of $56 million from the first quarter of 2016. That was also largely driven by higher margins, as well as lower tax payments in Andes and MCAC SBUs. We also earned $190 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, an increase of $5 million largely driven by higher margins. ","Now I\u2019ll cover SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 21. In the US, our results reflects slightly lower margins primarily due to the impact of major planned maintenance at Hawaii and lower contributions from DPL due to lower regulated ESP rates. Adjusted PTC also decreased due to a gain on a contract termination that occurred in 2016 at DPL related to its competitive retail business. Lower consolidated free cash flow also reflects higher purchase power and fuel cost at DPL.","At Andes our results reflects higher margins primarily due to higher reservoir levels and generating volume in Columbia. Consolidated free cash flow also reflects lower tax payments at Gener in Chile. In Brazil our results reflects higher margins, primarily driven by higher spot sales and energy prices at Tiet\u00ea. Adjusted PTC also benefited from the settlement of the legal dispute at our CCBT Uruguaiana. ","Consolidated free cash flow benefited from these impacts, but was partially offset by the recovery of high purchased power cost in 2016 from prior drivers and our distribution business Eletropaulo. It\u2019s worth mentioning that while we are expecting the low hydro conditions this year in Brazil, the impact will be much less than it\u2019s been in prior years, due to changes we\u2019ve made to our hedging strategy. ","We are now 83% contracted in 2017, which leaves us well positioned to absorb hydro shortfall. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, higher margins were driven primarily by higher availability in Mexico. Consolidated free cash flow also reflects lower tax payments in the DR. I\u2019d also like to note that in the first quarter, the DR was awarded new five year PPAs to recontract 470 megawatts of existing capacity. ","The PPAs were awarded in a competitive option and our cost efficient plant with the only capacity to clear. Pricing is in line with our existing PPAs and prior expectations. We are now 95% contracted for 2018 and 85% contracted for 2022. In Europe, our results reflects lower margins, largely due to the restructuring of the PPA at Maritza in Bulgaria in the second quarter of 2016. ","Consolidated free cash flow increased due to lower CapEx for environmental projects completed in 2016 and higher collections in the United Kingdom. ","Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and slightly higher working capital requirements at Mong Duong in Vietnam. ","Now to Slide 27, an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio. As you may know, last month we reached a settlement agreement with Commission\u2019s staff and certain interveners in our EFP case. The agreement includes a distribution Modernization Rider totaling $105 million per year over three years with a two year extension earmarked for debt reduction.","The ultimate goal is to transform DPL into a stable and growing T&D business. To that end, DPL has already announced plans to sell or exit all of its 2.1 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by mid-2018 and is exploring strategic options for the remaining 1 gigawatt of peaking capacity. ","Evidentiary hearing in the EFP case concluded April 11 with a final decision likely by late second quarter or early third quarter. We expect the ruling that will help DPL continue to reduce leverage and transition to investments-grade rating. ","Now to Slide 28, and our improving credit profile. Since February, we have prepaid $300 million of parent debt targeting our largest maturity with some of the highest coupons. This brings our total parent debt to $4.4 billion, which is a $2.1 billion or about a third reduction since September of 2011. Our Parent leverage ratio continues to improve dropping from 6.5 times in 2011 to 5 times last year and to expect it 4.6 times by year end.","Through discipline debt reduction, and strong growth in Parent free cash flow, we expect to attain investment-grade credit metrics by 2020. We continue to believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation. ","Now to our 2017 parent capital allocation on Slide 29, which is materially in line with prior disclosure. Sources on the left-hand side reflects $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash which includes roughly $625 million of Parent free cash flow. ","As we discussed last quarter, in addition to $300 million we received from the sale of Sul in Brazil, we are targeting $500 million in asset sale proceeds. We continue to make progress on this target, although much of that may occur later in the year. ","Moving to uses on the right-hand side of the slide, including the dividend increase we announced in December, we will be returning almost $320 million to shareholders this year. We\u2019ve allocated $340 million to prepay parent debt as I just discussed. ","We\u2019ve allocated $382 million to our acquisition of sPower and planned to invest $350 million in our subs, the majority of which for new projects under construction and in late-stage development. ","After considering these investments in our subs, debt prepayment and our current dividend were less with roughly $100 million of discretionary cash. ","Now to guidance beginning on Slide 30. Based on our performance year-to-date and foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of March 31, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance and expectations for 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020 for our metrics. ","As we\u2019ve discussed previously, EPS growth in 2018 is expected to be higher than the average annual growth we are projecting through 2020. In fact, we are forecasting approximately $0.20 of EPS growth in 2018. About a third of this growth is related to the 2.5 gigawatts or 75% of construction capacity coming online where our invested equity is approximately $700 million. ","These projects include the three CCGTs in the Dominican Republic, Indiana and Panama. About a third of this growth is being driven by our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives and operating improvements at our businesses. The remaining growth in 2018 is largely driven by contributions from growth in renewable through the sPower and the benefits of lower interest expense. ","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Tom. We have made significant progress in executing on our strategy by advancing our construction programs which is the key driver of our earnings and cash flow growth capitalizing on the advantages from our existing platform in markets where we have a strong position to make investments to ensure growth beyond 2020, rebalancing our portfolio to reduce risk and complexity by exiting non-core businesses and redeploying the proceeds consistent with our capital allocation framework, prepaying parent debt to improve our credit profile and achieving investment-grade metrics and optimizing our cost structure to improve operational efficiency and achieve our $400 million in annual savings target by 2020. ","With these actions, we are positioned to deliver average annual growth of 8% to 10% in all key metrics including free cash flow, earnings, and our dividend. Combining this growth and our current dividend yield will result in a total return of greater than 12%. We believe our attractive total return proposition will be better reflected in our share price as we continue to make progress on our strategic objectives and guidance.","Now, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. ","Ali Agha","Thank you, good morning. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning, Andr\u00e9s. First, just a housekeeping item, perhaps Tom, you had a 41% effective tax rate in the first quarter, are you still targeting 31% to 33% for the year? Any reason why Q1 was so much higher than that?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes, we are still targeting 31% to 33%, first quarter was just the timing of certain events, but 31% to 33% is still what we expect to be for the year.","Ali Agha","I see. And then, second on the asset sale front, the $500 million target that you have for the year, the Ohio sale of $50 million and this Kazakhstan sale of $24 million, do they count against that or are they separate from that? And related to that, in the past, you told us that you resumed about a $0.03 earnings dilution from the asset sale primarily from the timing. Given your comments that the timing maybe later in the year, is that $0.03 dilution still valid for 2017?","Thomas O'Flynn","So, Ali, as we talk about asset sales proceeds, those are \u2013 that\u2019s cash to corp. So the DPL money will all be used within DPL to retire debt, so that would not count into that. The Kazakhstan $24 million would, and yes, you are right, we had said $0.03 to $0.04 from dilution. We now expect that to be later in the year some maybe $0.02 or somewhat less. That will be a bit of a help from a timing perspective.","Ali Agha","Okay, and thirdly, in terms of mapping out your full year growth profile and as you point out, there is a fair amount of free cash flow that you\u2019ll generate over that period as well. Can you remind us for the cash that\u2019s unallocated at this point, what kind of return are you assuming on that cash that kind of gets you to that 8% to 10% overall annual growth rate CAGR? ","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes, we are assuming cash in the \u2013 cash return in the high-single digits on that, which is consistent with our \u2013 at the lower end of our return on investments that obviously we could look at other things such as paying down debt or repurchasing stock. ","Ali Agha","Okay, and last question, on the Colon project, with this ENGIE LNG contract, does that change your expected economics, the ROE that you resumed on that plant or was this already factored in into your overall ROE for that project?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes, Ali, we have assumed quite \u2013 say modest use of the tank in regasification facility in our numbers. So to the extent that we can use, make more use of what\u2019s basically existing capacity in the tank and in the terminal, that will be upside. So, with ENGIE in the Dominican Republic where we are using about 50% of the tank\u2019s capacity, and in the Panama where we had basically 25% of the tank\u2019s capacity being used, the sooner we fill this up, the better it will be. ","What is the upside potential? Well, if we utilize all of the existing tanks, say, by 2020 and 2021, that\u2019s between \u2013 depends a little bit on the timing, but somewhere between, say $0.03 and $0.05 of upside. Furthermore, we have the land that we could \u2013 and capacity at the terminals that we could, in each location build the second tank and that would be further upside potential. ","So we are very excited about this opportunity. We\u2019ve been quite successful on our own selling gas in the Dominican Republic for transportation and for industry. We\u2019ve done our first shipments in thermal tanks or really containers of LNG to other, another island in the Caribbean. ","So this is an upside. We see that in the future, certainly ship bunkering will be important. We also see again more conversion of plants, industry, transportation in the Caribbean and in Central America. And with a strong partner like ENGIE that can provide structured products to offtakers, we are very well positioned, but we are just starting and that\u2019s why we have very modest assumptions in our numbers. ","Ali Agha","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Hey, good morning. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","So, quick couple of questions here to follow-up. First on the SG&A reductions, you announced sort of an acceleration. Is that already reflected in your guidance as you see it for this year, and just to clarify that? ","And then separate, just the distinction, as you think about the 2018 uplift of $0.20 you discussed, can you discuss some of the other puts and takes? I am curious as to what the net EPS impact is of the divestment and\/or sale, and the retirement of the DPL asset? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay, let me take the first one. In terms of the first, this is what we have announced before, I mean, I think we\u2019ve delivered, actually more than delivered every year in terms of the guidance we set out. So what we are saying is we feel very comfortable with the $50 million that we announced and is in our guidance for 2017, and an additional $50 million in 2018 and last time we also announced that we \u2013 that program will continue -- this sort of productivity improvements will continue in 2019 and 2020 although somewhat at a decelerated pace.","So, basically, this is just a reaffirmation of what we announced before. Now on the \u2013 sorry, the second question is in terms of, when you are talking about the dilution from the sale of the DP&L assets. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Yes, I was thinking, sorry, go for it.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, Julien it\u2019s probably couple of things when you look at DPL it\u2019s probably about a penny and obviously it depends upon terms et cetera. But maybe it\u2019s about a penny in terms of the \u2013 what we are looking at, but that was all contemplated when we gave our guidance in February. ","I would say on a cash flow basis, DPL will be pretty neutrally cash flow EBITDA minus CapEx is pretty much breakeven as we see it through our forecast period even before other indirect costs. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Got it, excellent, and then can I just clarify, because I thought I heard you talk about an acceleration in SG&A. How does the classes of European and Asian business together fit within the context of SG&A? Is that still part of the 50 or is that actually going to potentially see some more of that 100 biased toward the 70?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, Julien, that is part of the 50 for this year and part of the 100 for the end of next year. So we will continue to take steps, obviously as we divest those assets, that also helps us to accelerate this process. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Got it. And to clarify for 2018, you talk about $0.20 of uplift, obviously DPL is not a huge impact there in terms of offsets. What are some of the other known factors that we should just be aware of it, if you will?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think, what Tom and I said, I mean, the main is our construction program. So we had three CCGTs that will be online in 2018 we have the cost-cutting program that we have announced and we\u2019ve had the continued delevering. So those are the three main items that are going to contribute to the increase in our earnings and cash flow in 2018.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Right, absolutely any other offsets there, so the $0.20 contemplates the construction program and doesn\u2019t include the cost-cutting?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, it does. It includes all.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Okay, okay. So that\u2019s a net number year-over-year inclusive of balance sheet SG&A and net contract degradation against growth?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, that\u2019s correct. And like all of our numbers, that\u2019s based on currency and commodities, forward curves as of today. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith ","Right, excellent, all right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you all very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon ","Thanks, Good morning. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon ","I think most of this \u2013 most of my questions have been asked, but what I am looking at slide 53, and I am comparing it to your capital allocation slide. Your investments in subsidiaries is up $100 million versus the Q4 disclosure and it looks like your investment in Alto Maipo is up from $335 million of AES equity to $413 million. ","So that looks like it represents the majority of that increase. Am I correlating that correctly? And if so, does that in fact \u2013 taking into account the cost overrun or not because the footnotes still says it excludes the cost overrun. ","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes that does take into account. The full 20% cost overrun in Alto Maipo. ","Greg Gordon ","Okay, so that \u2013 so the footnote should have been excluded then starts it\u2019s kind of a typo?","Thomas O'Flynn","Well, it\u2019s an additional 100 in 2017 from Gener and we own 67% of Gener. Most of the financing again is coming from the lender and the minority partner.","Greg Gordon ","No, I understand that. I am just asking a very simple question. In the Q4 deck you have $335 million invested, but the footnote saying excluding the overrun.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Greg you are right. This includes the cost overruns. So there is a typo there, as you mentioned.","Greg Gordon ","Okay, so that typo should have been removed. Great, I just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. And then \u2013 but overall\u2026","Thomas O'Flynn","Greg, it\u2019s Tom. First off, it\u2019s impressive you saw the typo on Page 53. But just going back to your first question on the up 100, you are right in terms of investment subs. It\u2019s in smaller pieces, we do have a modest acceleration of our investment in Colon from 2018 to 2017, so it\u2019s a part of it and then the other large part is an investment in renewable including sPower. That\u2019s the biggest of the diff in that 100.","Greg Gordon ","Okay, great. So, we\u2019ve got Alto Maipo, Colon and sPower and that represents the change?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes, Alto Maipo is very modest for this year, because A, it\u2019s funded by Gener, lower dividends, but it\u2019s really not factoring into that, because it\u2019s funded by Gener and it\u2019s funded over the next couple of years.","Greg Gordon ","Okay, I understand. Okay, so, when I am looking at Page 53 versus this year\u2019s capital allocation, 53 is total not just this year, it\u2019s happening over a period of time, that\u2019s the difference. ","Thomas O'Flynn","Correct.","Greg Gordon ","Okay, got you, perfect. And then also your \u2013 it looks like your total cash flow over the 2020 period, you\u2019ve raised at the midpoint by about $100 million. Is that just because you\u2019re accelerating debt reduction and retaining more cash from interest savings or is it a combination of other small things?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes, combination of small things.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, probably, maybe just rounding.","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes.","Greg Gordon ","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Next question today comes from Chris Morgan with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Hey guys, it\u2019s actually Angie Storozynski. So, I didn\u2019t hear any comments about Brazil. Could you say about \u2013 anything about economic recovery and the future of your utility there? Thank you.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure, hi, Angie. In Brazil, what we are seeing is, last quarter, we saw flattening of the decline and this year we might seeing a slight pickup in demand. But, more like 1% demand has decreased like 10%. So, overall, we are modestly optimistic about Brazil. The President is taking a number \u2013 on a number of the important reforms that it flow through, going very well for the country, but we expect a gradual slow recovery in Brazil. ","Now this year, they are having a drought and as Tom mentioned, I think, it\u2019s a good example of how our change in commercial strategy and the level of contracting that we have had made it, quite frankly a very small issue, where two years ago it was a very big issue for us. And so, it\u2019s basically the same asset I should say, but it makes a very big difference. ","So, with the acquisition of the wins that will help provide Tiet\u00ea with basically assets which are not correlated with hydrology which are contracted at 18 years at good prices. Now regarding our utility, which is Eletropaulo and remember we sold, Sul. What we are doing is moving forward on listing it on Novo Mercado and that is going well. ","And so basically, being on the Novo Mercado means, one share one vote and therefore we would no longer consolidate Eletropaulo in our numbers. Now the company has had a significant recovery in its share price this year and it\u2019s continuing to make improvements operationally. ","Angie Storozynski","Okay, and then, in Chile, so, thanks for the update on the construction progress on Alto Maipo. Is there \u2013 have you managed to secure anymore contracts for this asset? And also any indication on pricing for power, especially ahead of the next forward power auction?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We have not secured anymore contracts for Alto Maipo at this stage. It\u2019s part of the Gener portfolio. So, they have basically the Gener, it\u2019s highly contracted through 2021, 2023. So we don\u2019t have any immediate issues at Gener. I mean, last year was a record year for Gener, both on earnings and cash flow. ","This year is also looking extremely good. So, what we are seeing, again, as re-contracting rates passes that window, what we\u2019ve seen on the \u2013 we have signed some new contracts, especially one of our subsidies of Gener which is Guacolda and these were rates around 70. ","But we continue to see sort of a long run price in the sort of mid $60 per megawatt hour and that\u2019s without assuming any sort of rebound in mining activity or more rapid growth of the economy. Chile is growing about 2%, 2.5% and traditionally it\u2019s been growing more sort of at 4%, 5%. So we have a pickup in economic activity. We think these prices could improve further. ","Angie Storozynski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research Consulting. Please go ahead.","Lasan Johong ","Thank you. I wanted to ask a strategic question in a sense that, what \u2013 is it going to stay 2.5 to 3 gigawatts of new construction projects per year would jump your growth rates from around 10% to 20% a year?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That will depend a little bit on \u2013 to what extent we have partnerships in those deals. This year, with the acquisition of sPower and some of the new things we\u2019ve commissioned, we\u2019ll be close to that number in terms of new projects and acquisitions. So, but it will depend on how much of those projects we own and whether it\u2019s 50%, whether it\u2019s 80%. We continue to plan to basically include partners on most of our big projects.","Lasan Johong ","That makes sense and I am moving in. So, in terms of discretionary cash flow, you guys have about $1.4 billion through 2020. And right now, to what - less than over $400 million has been dedicated to new projects. So, if all of that remaining discretionary cash flow to be used for growth projects, is it correct to assume that you can reach that 20% type compound annual growth rate? ","Thomas O'Flynn","No, that seems awfully high, quite frankly, no. One thing is very important, we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital allocation and we were committed to growing the dividend, reaching investment-grade and continuing to decrease our risk on this portfolio from all factors. ","So, that seems high. I mean, to get there, I mean if you had some dramatic improvements in some of the economies and commodity prices, perhaps, but we do have significant upside as I mentioned on LNG and which we\u2019ve quantified. ","And on energy storage, we are continuing to work on that. We are making good progress and when we feel confident that we can provide some numbers, we will do so. But, again, this is our plan. We will be disciplined and ensure that when we grow, it\u2019s profitable growth. And all of our growth has to come on to our platform really has to \u2013 we have to be able to provide synergies or economies of scale or something like that before we do an acquisition.","Lasan Johong ","So, just a little clear, the $1.4 billion would not get you to the 20% growth rate?","Thomas O'Flynn","Probably, not, I mean, of course it really isn\u2019t our goal. So what\u2019s more important for us is to be disciplined, decrease risk and hit those \u2013 grow our dividend and improve our credit metrics. So, with that in mind, I don\u2019t see it quite frankly. ","Lasan Johong ","Okay, then the flip side of the question is, once you get to a position where you think your risk is lowering off and the debt payments have gotten you to an investment-grade credit metric, what is going to be y our forward-looking strategy from that point on? Is it going to be more constrained on growth? Is it going to be maintaining the ship on course? How would you change that strategy? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, when I think of the new strategy that we announced, based on the prior five year strategy, it would be an evolution of it. We think that the key elements are really having platforms, integrating renewable with existing capacity from thermal and hydro. And also being a leader in new technology. So, we are all about three months into the new strategy and we will update you next time.","Lasan Johong ","Okay, fair enough. Thank you, Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you, Lasan.","Operator","The next today comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead. ","Charles Fishman","Thank you, and good morning. Yes, I had the same question, Greg did about the $100 million. But I can assure you I never would have seen the footnote error on Slide 53. Here is my other question that I got left. ","Andres, you talked on Slide 6, Alto Maipo, the problem is the tunnel. And tunnel on these type of projects can be certainly \u2013 you are not the first to experience tunneling challenges. Of the 52% complete right now, what percent of the tunnel is complete? Or is that \u2013 are you talking about the tunnels? Is that the main part of the project or how should we look at that? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That\u2019s a very perceptive question. It\u2019s 52% complete that includes all of the works and all of the equipment. On that tunneling we are more than a third complete on the tunneling. And basically what happened here is that the rock ended up being a less crusted than all of our projections and that\u2019s what\u2019s really slowed us down, because when you have to do more reinforcements you have to go more slowly and it was a bit surprising, because this is an expansion of an existing facility Alfalfal. ","So it\u2019s in the same mountain. It reterminates some of the same water. But that is what it is and as you are right, we are not the first to have encountered a different lock and what was expected once you start tunneling.","Charles Fishman","Okay, and then on Slide 6, I assume, that\u2019s a tunnel boring machine we are looking at, is that the machine that\u2019s actually in there now working?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That\u2019s exactly right.

","The total shutdown plus sale and then we also have incorporated updated non-bypassable, which is now $105 million versus what we were expecting, which was slightly higher than that.

Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I hope that all of you in the Northeast have had your power restored at home and have fully recovered from Hurricane Sandy. We at AES have done as much as possible to help impacted areas, sending more than half of our available field resources from DP&L and IP&L (sic) [IPL] to help out affected service providers.","Now turning to the third quarter results. I'm pleased to say that our financial performance this quarter improved over both the second quarter of this year as well as the third quarter of 2011. This was expected and keeps us on track for our full year guidance. Adjusted EPS of $0.36 in the third quarter brings our year-to-date total to $0.91, which is $0.10 higher than what we earned in the first 9 months of 2011. The story is similar for our cash flow metrics. All in all, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our guidance commitments for 2012.","Additionally, we recently announced organizational changes that will create greater efficiencies by placing functional and operational activities in the right place and eliminating overhead redundancies. These changes are in line with our strategy and build on the cost savings that we had implemented over the past year. I will discuss the financial benefits of this reorganization in some detail later on in my remarks.","Today, I'd like to focus on 2 main topics: first, an update on recent developments in our core markets, including DPL in the U.S., Brazil and Chile; and second, progress on our strategic plans to unlock shareholder value, including deleveraging, returning cash to shareholders and improving profitability. Later, Tom will work you through the specific drivers of our results as well as our near-term outlook.","Turning to Slide 4. I'd like to provide you with an update on recent developments at DPL. As we announced last week, we determined that a goodwill impairment of between $1.7 billion and $2 billion at DPL was required. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, the fundamentals of the business have been adversely affected since the acquisition was announced in April 2011. This is primarily the result of sustained lower natural gas prices and more customers moving to competitive retail providers, including our own, at reduced margins. Consequently, forecasted profitability and cash flows are lower, resulting in the goodwill impairment in the range we have provided.","Obviously, we are disappointed with these developments at DPL. That said, we are committed to reaching the most positive regulatory and business outcome possible. To that end, we're working to achieve a reasonable result in the rate case, and we continue to expand our retail customer base inside and outside of DP&L's service territory. And we will strengthen DP&L's balance sheet by using its internally generated cash to pay down debt.","Our Electric Security Plan, or ESP, application is designed to balance DP&L's need to maintain its financial integrity with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio's desire for a more rapid evolution to a market-based rate. If approved, the proposed ESP will allow DP&L to collect a non-bypassable Service Stability Rider that will give the company an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on equity. The approval process is moving forward, and the pre-hearings and technical conference have been scheduled for November 9. We are hopeful that the new ESP will be in place by no later than the first quarter of 2013. In the event that a decision or settlement is not reached by the end of 2012, we have also filed a motion with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio requesting an extension of DP&L's current rate until a final decision is reached.","Next, regarding our strategy to grow our retail customer base, we continue to expand our retail load inside and outside of DP&L's service territory in Ohio. Within DP&L's territory, we have retained roughly 75% of the switch load, although, as I said earlier, at significantly lower margins.","In markets outside of DP&L's service territory, both in Ohio and Illinois, our retail business is currently serving more than 150,000 customers. By year's end, we are projecting that DPL's retail business will be serving approximately 200,000 customers, which represent a net increase of approximately 175,000 in the company's total number of customers during 2012.","Finally, we are working to strengthen DPL's balance sheet through a multiyear deleveraging and refinancing program. In 2012, we expect that DPL will distribute to AES $122 million, of which we've already received $87 million as of the end of September. Over the next couple of years, however, we expect to use essentially all cash generated from operations within the DPL group of companies for debt reduction.","Next, turning to Slide 5 and our businesses in Brazil. As many of you are aware, in order to stimulate the economy, the Government of Brazil recently announced an energy cost reduction program, or Provisional Measure 579, which targets a 20% reduction in electricity prices. About 1\/3 of this planned reduction is expected to be driven by lowering indirect taxes on the sector. The remaining 2\/3 of this reduction is being targeted through negotiations with various generators and T&D companies whose concession contracts are up for renewal between 2015 and 2017. These rules are still pending congressional approval and the implementation is scheduled for February of 2013.","I would like to emphasize that the proposed rules are not expected to have any significant impact in the near term on our businesses in Brazil. Let me explain why. Tiet\u00ea, our main generation business in Brazil, has a long-term concession expiring in 2029 and thus will not be subject to this regulation. Furthermore, we are insulated in the short term as 100% of Tiet\u00ea's output is contracted with Eletropaulo through December 2015. Beyond 2015, it's still too early to tell what the incremental impact of MP 579 will be on energy prices in Brazil.","As far as the impact on our 2 distribution businesses, Eletropaulo and Sul, we do not expect any meaningful impact on either. Both utilities earn a return on their regulated asset base, and energy purchases are treated as a cost pass-through. On balance, the Brazilian Government's initiatives to stimulate economic growth should help increase demand for electricity, which will result in increased revenue for both Eletropaulo and Sul.","Now turning to Slide 6. I would like to give you a brief update on AES Gener. I'm happy to report that all of our plants are fully available, including those that were offline in the second quarter for repairs and maintenance. As discussed on our previous calls, our Angamos plant in the north of Chile is now 90% contracted, and, therefore, it's exposure to low spot prices has been significantly reduced. In addition, we continue to see energy demand growth of between 4% and 6% in Chile. We've also seen positive results at some of our other important businesses, including Masinloc in the Philippines, Maritza in Bulgaria and Southland in the U.S.","Turning to Slide 7. I would like to provide you with an update on the strategic plan to unlock shareholder value that we laid out late last year. Just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for enhancing shareholder value are: first, optimizing capital allocation; second, improving the profitability of the existing portfolio; and third, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets.","Now turning to capital allocation on Slide 8. As we have discussed in the past, our goal is to maximize risk-adjusted returns on a per share basis by allocating our discretionary cash across various uses, including deleveraging, share buyback, offering a predictable and growing dividend and investing in platform expansions. Last month, the Board approved the prepayment of $225 million of corporate debt, which we expect to complete later this year or early next. This will help us not only lower our interest expense but will also help us with our credit metrics by mitigating the impact of lost earnings and cash flows from assets that we have sold. Once completed, the prepayment will bring our total debt repayments to approximately $717 million since September of 2011, including both corporate-level debt and expensive nonrecourse debt at our Brasiliana subsidiary.","With respect to share repurchases, in the third quarter, we repurchased 4.3 million shares for approximately $49 million, representing an average price of $11.38. This brings our total investment in our shares since September of 2011 to $390 million, representing nearly 34 million shares or approximately 4% of shares outstanding.","Last but not least, we have also declared our first cash dividend in almost 20 years, which is set to be paid on November 15. The dividend is an important component of our total return proposition.","Now please turn to Slide 9, and let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. As you may recall, in late 2011, we announced an effort to reduce SG&A by $100 million by 2014. For 2012, we're ahead of our original goal of $50 million, and we now expect to achieve at least $65 million in cost savings this year.","As a result of the recently announced reorganization, we now expect to realize the full $100 million of savings in 2013. Ultimately, the reorganization will result in additional savings of $45 million to achieve a total reduction of $145 million in annual overhead expense relative to 2011.","I would like to point out that the cost saving numbers I just mentioned only reflect savings in overhead at the AES level, and they do not include additional cost savings at our businesses, such as Brazil, where we are implementing our Creando Valor [ph] program to improve that company's performance by $224 million per year by 2015, of which $150 million will be achieved by the end of 2012. We see additional opportunities for savings in fuel sourcing and in operations and maintenance expenses. For example, we presently purchase $2 billion of coal a year, and we're saving about $80 million as a result of implementing a comprehensive global sourcing framework, including the blending of coals and having the ability to redirect coal shipments. However, we believe we have not yet exploited all of the advantages from our global scale and possible synergies and are working hard to do so.","Moving to Slide 10. Let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus through asset sales. Last quarter, we announced the sale of our China portfolio. I'm pleased to report that we have closed and received $86 million in the process for 2 of the 3 businesses. We expect the third transaction for $49 million to close within the next few weeks. To date, we have sold 9 assets for $933 million in net equity proceeds at an average PE multiple of more than 20. We continue to seek additional opportunities to streamline our portfolio by exiting those markets where we do not have a competitive advantage or a strong platform with an opportunity for expansion. Once completed, we expect that this strategy will result in a lower overall risk profile and a more focused and efficient company.","In summary, we believe that we are consistently executing on the plans that we laid out in our first call last November.","Now Tom will review the drivers of our quarterly results, guidance and platform expansion projects in more detail.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Thanks, Andres, and good morning all. Before I get into our results, I'd first like to say that I'm very pleased to be here. In the past couple of months, I've learned a lot about the company, the people, the culture and the businesses. Like any company, there are a number of exciting aspects and also some challenges. However, I've been impressed by the commitment of our people as well as the potential for improving our portfolio, delivering attractive returns to our shareholders and the other things that Andres laid out.","This morning, beginning on Slide 11, I'll cover the following topics: first, our third quarter results and key drivers of gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted pretax contribution and free cash flow and parent liquidity; second, our near-term capital allocation plans; and finally, an update on our guidance and total return expectations.","As Andres mentioned, we reported $0.36 of adjusted EPS for the third quarter. This brings our 9-month earnings to $0.91 or about 3\/4 of the low end of our full year 2012 guidance.","Now to Slide 12. Our proportional gross margin increased by $168 million over the third quarter of 2011. The majority of this increase was driven by new businesses, such as Changuinola in Panama, Angamos in Chile and DPL in the U.S. In addition, we saw favorable year-over-year trends at several of our larger generation businesses, such as Masinloc in the Philippines and Maritza in Bulgaria. These trends were partially offset by lower tariff rates and higher fixed costs at Eletropaulo in Brazil.","Now turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 13. Third quarter results increased by $0.08, or 29%, to $0.36. This increase was primarily driven by $0.09 of contributions from the new businesses I just covered, $0.01 from lower share count and $0.02 from our cost-cutting initiatives, which have lowered SG&A expense by $26 million in the third quarter and $57 million year-to-date. These gains were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts of about $0.03.","Now to Slide 14. I'd like to review a new earnings metric that we're introducing this quarter. We hear frequently from investors that with a large number of businesses, it can be difficult to determine what has the biggest impact on the bottom line. In an effort to provide additional transparency, we are introducing adjusted pretax contribution, a metric that we use internally to measure financial performance. This measure is calculated by taking the pretax earnings from each business, including those accounted for as equity in earnings, and adjusting for our ownership percentage. In addition, we make the same pro forma adjustments that we do for adjusted EPS.","On Slide 14, we've graphed the relative contribution that each of our segments has made to year-to-date adjusted PTC of $1.5 billion. As you can see, for example, Latin America generation at 37% is the single largest contributor, driven primarily by our generation fleets at Chile, the Dominican Republic and Brazil. Our generation businesses in Europe and North America were also significant contributors.","The measure also highlights that some of our businesses' consolidated results are significantly different than their bottom line impact. This is most notable in Eletropaulo, which we control and consolidate but have an economic interest of only about 16%. As shown on the slide, our utility businesses in Latin America contribute only 8% of adjusted PTC. We hope this additional disclosure will help to simplify the AES story and allow you to focus on the biggest value drivers.","Now to Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow has increased $41 million compared to the third quarter of last year. This increase was driven primarily by contributions from new businesses, partially offset by a decline in Eletropaulo.","Now on to Slide 16 and parent liquidity. During the quarter, we benefited from $426 million of inflows from asset sales and cash flow from our subsidiaries. Also during the quarter, we returned $71 million to shareholders via share repurchases. After $157 million of corporate interest, overhead and investments, we ended the third quarter with more than $1.2 billion of parent liquidity, up from $1 billion at the end of last quarter.","Now to Slide 17. I'd like to discuss our plans for capital allocation for the balance of the year. This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we've already allocated 67% to returning cash to shareholders and deleveraging, including the $225 million debt paydown expected later this year or early next. We've allocated another 17%, or $262 million, to growth investments. The remaining 16%, or $258 million, of year-end cash will be combined with parent free cash flows in 2013 to be allocated in line with our capital allocation framework.","Now let me take a minute to review a couple of the segments for 2013. On the sources side, we expect parent free cash flow to be lower than the 2012 expectations of $550 million. It'll be due to 2 major factors, the first being DPL and secondly from AES Gener and IPL as those businesses retain some cash to reinvest. In terms of the use of discretionary cash, we expect growth investments to be lower than the 2012 levels of $262 million. These 2013 investments, which could total up to $200 million, are largely in platform expansions that I'll discuss in a moment.","Regarding the dividend and growth, we expect to evaluate the reasonableness of dividend increases on an annual basis in the beginning of the fourth quarter, consistent with the timing of our annual planning process. We appreciate the value of moving our dividend yield to be more in line with that of the S&P 500, and we'll factor that into our future deliberations. Finally, the remaining cash will be invested in both debt reductions and share repurchases with more weighting towards debt reductions in 2013.","Now to Slide 18. We're reaffirming our 2012 guidance elements as discussed on last quarter's call. Consistent with our comments from last quarter, we expect to come in at the low end of the range of $1.22 to $1.30 for adjusted EPS. Proportional free cash flow and subsidiary distributions are also expected to come in at the low end of our guidance range.","Now to Slide 19 and looking beyond 2012. We expect modest adjusted EPS growth in 2013 compared to our 2012 expectations. This modest growth is largely driven by improved operating performance at AES Gener in Chile, recovery at Eletropaulo in Brazil and the full year benefits of capital allocation and our cost savings initiatives. These benefits are partially offset by lower earnings from DPL and weaker foreign exchange. Please keep in mind that it's based on foreign exchange and commodities as of September 30, our expectations of near-term regulatory proceedings, particularly at DPL, and the current macro outlook in each of our key markets. To the extent these items change, our guidance could be impacted.","This guidance assumes the extension of the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, look-through provision originally enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year. If the CFC look-through rule is not extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this would be a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss carryforward of about $2.1 billion.","Overall, we continue to project a tax rate on adjusted earnings in the low 30% range.","As Andres discussed, we continue to look for opportunities to streamline our business focus. Although most of our efforts to date have been EPS neutral to accretive, this may be more difficult as we monetize some assets. Prior to releasing a defined 2013 guidance range during our year-end call, we'll have an updated view of relevant macro environments and the impact of potential portfolio de-risking activities.","Now to Slide 20. Earlier this year, we introduced a 3-year average annual total return target of 8% to 10% comprised of EPS growth and dividend yield. Since our last earnings call, we've made considerable progress on our annual planning process. And though not fully complete, it is evident to us that our earnings growth rate through 2015 will likely be lower than previous estimates. This decline is driven by lower earnings from DPL in 2014 and '15 due to the issues that Andres has covered. We had been anticipating some improvement at DPL, which is no longer the case. In addition, the compounding effect that reduced cash flow also has an impact. Secondly, lower-than-expected earnings in Brazil, driven largely by lower demand, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a more negative outcome than expected on the tariff reset at Eletropaulo. These will be partially offset by improved performance at our businesses in Chile, IPL in the U.S. and the additional cost savings we recently announced. In light of these factors, we're now expecting an average total return through 2015 of 6% to 8%. We appreciate that this is a difficult revision but believe it is a more appropriate reflection of our current outlook.","Before turning the call back to Andres, I'd like to cover the progress we're making on our almost 1,800 megawatts of projects under construction as well as our platform expansions under development.","Looking at Slide 21, our construction program remains on schedule. In addition, we've already secured the necessary financing and funded 100% of our equity commitments for these projects. In terms of progress on these specific projects, work at our 270-megawatt, coal-fired Campiche project in Chile is progressing well. I was in Chile a couple of weeks ago and had a good first-hand look at the progress. Synchronization of the unit is scheduled for November, and commercial operation is expected in early 2013. At our Kribi project, a 216-megawatt gas-fired power plant in Cameroon, we've energized a 60-mile transmission line, and plant testing will begin in December. Finally, our 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong coal-fired plant in Vietnam is progressing on time and on budget, and operations are expected to begin in 2015. We're especially pleased that this project has surpassed 5 million man-hours without a lost time incident and is achieving world-class safety standards.","Now to Slide 22. In terms of future value creation beyond these construction projects, we continue to move forward on developing power plants in the markets where we have a significant presence and a compelling competitive advantage. Our focus is to use the most efficient source of capital, including bringing in strategic partners, using low-cost project financing, multilateral funding and operating cash flows generated at the existing businesses. For example, at Cochrane, 530-megawatt coal-fired expansion of our Angamos platform at AES Gener, we now have in place a construction contract, long-term power sales agreements for the majority of output and are close to bringing in a strategic partner. We're focused on finalizing project financing, and construction is expected to begin in 2013.","With regard to Alto Maipo, a 530-megawatt hydro project also at Gener, we've successfully executed the principal construction contracts, moved forward with preliminary works, continue to work on the remaining project milestones and expect to begin construction also in 2013. Similarly, here in the U.S., we plan to upgrade 100% of our baseload, coal-fired fleet at IPL with investments in environmental controls to comply with MATS. This investment will earn regulated returns and will also fulfill a majority of the necessary environmental upgrades required for MATS at all of our 7,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating here in the U.S. We expect this investment to begin in the second half 2013, carrying on through 2016, with potential equity investment of up to $300 million.","In closing, I look forward to seeing many of you next week at the EEI, and I'll now turn it back over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay. Thank you, Tom. Let me summarize what I believe to be the key points of this call. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which were in line with expectations. We're on track to deliver a 20% adjusted EPS growth this year, in line with our guidance. Despite the challenges we have faced recently, the earning power of the company remained strong, and we expect to deliver a 6% to 8% average annual return from 2012 through 2015, including dividend yield and EPS growth. Although we won't be satisfied with this rate of return, we believe it's prudent to lower expectations at this time primarily given lower forecasts from DPL and Brazil. But we will, nonetheless, continue to strive for higher total returns for our shareholders. We have taken actions to significantly reduce our overhead and streamline our organization. We will also aggressively pursue additional operating cost savings. We will continue to de-risk the company through deleveraging and narrowing our geographic focus through asset sales. And we're committed to pulling all levers to improve risk-adjusted returns from our platform businesses. Finally, along with Tom, Andy Vesey and I will also be at the EEI next week, and we look forward to seeing many of you.","Operator, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jon Cohen with ISI.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess my first question is on the parent free cash flow. Tom, you said that next year, you expect it to be somewhat lower than the $550 million midpoint of this year. And then you said growth CapEx was expected to be more in the $200 million range and the remainder will be skewed more toward debt repayment. First of all, is there a good way of thinking about what the long-term parent free cash flow contribution from the subsidiaries is? Is that something less than $500 million? I mean, how do we think about what that's going to be longer term? And secondly, of your $6 billion of recourse debt, do you have a target in mind of what you want to get  that down to? At what point would you be comfortable with the current cash flow profile? What level of debt do you think is right at the holdco?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Okay, Jon, good questions. In terms of next year, I touched on it briefly, but the $550 million, back from the Slide 17, I think it was, will be lower next year really partially because of reduced cash coming from DPL. But also, we're making reinvestments in a couple of businesses. As I mentioned, IPL and, secondly, Gener. The number of the-- so we expect that to be lower. We'll give you a better idea of what our expectations will be at our year-end call when we give you guidance. I think, though, the $500 million-ish range is a more indicative indication of a more normalized number. So this year would be closer to what we think would be a more normalized number. Next year, it'll be lower, below the -- below the, let's say, a $500 million normalized number really because of the reinvestments we're making. In terms of the CapEx, I said up to $200 million. I do mean up to $200 million. One of the biggest things -- it could be as little as half that amount. One of the issues is that Gener, it's been a great performer for us, great grower. They are building the 2 projects: coal and the hydro. Coal will come first, Cochrane I mentioned. But the issue was that they will need some equity at the Gener level to do that. And the $200 million would contemplate some equity being put in by AES. Obviously, another alternative is them issuing shares in the market to do that. So well-known company with good market cap, trades well, trades better than us. So as -- one of the things we'll think about is what the right funding is. To the extent that they access the majority of the equity they need in the markets, or maybe there's a splitting the baby concept, then that $200 million could be as little as $100 million to $125 million. That's just something we'll have to give some thought to. In terms of -- going back to the third part of your question, the 6 -- I think it's $6.2 billion of parent debt, including some trust preferreds, but we will look for coverage ratios. I think we've said that we want to maintain our rating and work it up over time. But the coverage ratio we look at in terms of debt-to-cash flow. I think we've used the range of 4.5 to 5.5. That continues to be a target that we've got. Near term, we're a little -- we're skewed towards the higher end of that range. That's why I said for '13, some of our cash flow available may be weighted more towards share repurchase. But once again, we see that as really a 2013-only focus. We've got the ability to do both, but we really focus -- kind of bottom line, we focus on the leverage, the coverage ratios. As you know, that's a more appropriate indication of credit quality.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Jon, this is Andres. What I'd like to say about Gener, we'll continue what we've done very successfully. So it's really very capital and tax efficient to really use some of the resources at Gener rather than sending them up and sending them back down. And as Tom mentioned in his speech, we're also looking at partners, partners that bring not only financing, but they bring access to bilaterals, Exims, et cetera. So really, we're optimizing. Gener, will continue to do that. And I think the one change from the past is looking more at partners than we did, and that's partly due to project financing is getting tougher everywhere. So we'll continue to do at Gener what we've done and looking for the most tax-efficient way to do so and create the most value.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And just one quick question on Page -- on your Page 19, drivers of growth in '13. I noticed that you don't have a tariff reset at AES Sul in here. Is that something that you expect to be a negative for '13?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","The tariff reset in 2013 at Sul, with -- Sul is in a different situation than Eletropaulo, so we don't expect the sort of outcome we had in Eletropaulo. But it will have the tariff reset, and we do expect some decrease from Sul as a result of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In terms of debt reduction, could you just provide perhaps a multiyear view? I mean, in -- within that 4 to 5.5 range, just kind of how quickly do you want to get there, if you will?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, it's 4.5 to 5.5, Julien. Don't upgrade me to quickly here. But I think we want to stay within that 4.5 to 5.5 range. We want to bring it down to the lower end of that range over a, let's say, a 3-year period. As we talk about our overall numbers here, we think about things through '15, that would be where we'd want to get to, in that same kind of  '15 range. So as you know, that's a function both of the cash flow of the business as well as the -- as well as absolute debt.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And could you provide just a little bit -- I mean, in the past, you've described discrete project EPS contributions going into '13 like Kribi or something. Like to that extent, could you kind of provide a little bit of sense here on your growth drivers? More granularity?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Sure. I mean, the 2 main -- what we basically have happening in 2013 is, one, we have Campiche coming online, we have a full year of a more [ph] contract at Angamos. In Chile, one of the things that has affected our results was that this year, we were somewhat short in the -- thick in the South, and prices were very high because of poor hydrology. And we were actually somewhat less contracted than the -- our final objective in the north, and their prices were very low because of a -- basically, people had a take-or-pay gas contract. So those things get corrected. We also have, in terms of some of our wind projects in the U.S., as the tax equity, let's say, matures, that we will have more earnings from those assets in the U.S. And we'll also have the new plants that have been brought on for the full year. And so I think that, that -- those are some of the main drivers that we have. We can give you perhaps a more -- a specific breakdown of the small plants. But it's a different situation than we were this year where the big driver, we had a lot of megawatts coming online at the beginning of the year.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Which that kind of weighed, I mean...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then maybe just a quick follow-up on asset sales. I mean, you've kind of executed, for the most part, on the bulk of what you described, call it earlier this year. What's the next round? Or is there another around here that we're -- that you're contemplating? And where -- at least from a geographic perspective, where should we think about that? What kind of assets? Perhaps more renewables?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","So that's a great question. I think that sort of going back to what we've laid out, we said we had a universe of about $2 billion of equity in assets that we could sell -- and so we've executed about half of that -- and that we would be concentrating on those that weren't sort of platforms for growth that had unused leverage capacity or the ability to raise our own money, or really places we didn't feel we had a sustainable competitive advantage. And so I think we've done that pretty much to date. Now going forward, what will we do? Well, look, the same framework is in place. We don't like to really give specific names because, of course, we're operating these businesses. And if we say they're up for sale, this -- it makes it more difficult to continue operating them at the optimal level. But again, there would be those where we have like one plant, one-off where we don't see a platform of growing. Regarding renewables, we have changed the way we think about most renewables, certainly wind. We're not thinking about a stand-alone wind business but really thinking of placing wind into the sort of geographic units that we have. So wind becomes just another way of providing energy. And what we've seen is where we really exploit the sort of platform concept, we're more successful. If you think of something like battery storage, we are leaders in exploiting, let's say, this technology. And where we've really been successful is where we apply it to our existing businesses. The one exception of this, of course, is solar. In solar, we have a 50-50 JV with Riverstone. And, of course, both of us will be seeking to monetize this asset over time. But other than that, I really can't give you more specifics. But I would say you should expect over time, a continued asset sales. This will also help us reduce cost, help us reduce our focus. And what we'll do is as soon as we really have something firm, announce it and make it public. But we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Hey, Andres, and you alluded to this a little bit in your closing remarks, but I want to pick up on that. The 6% to 8% total return that you're projecting for the next 3 years, I'm just curious who you benchmark yourself against. And, I mean, how do you justify that as an acceptable return for investors looking forward when they look at alternative investments particularly in the power utility space? And I guess a related question to that, does that cause you to step back and look at your portfolio and say, are you in the right mix of business given that, that's kind of return that this portfolio is generating for you?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, I think first of all, let's step back a second. This year, we're growing earnings 20%. So I think that would probably certainly rank us among the top of our peers in this space. So I think what we're doing is coming off a growth of 20%. Now what we have done is really look at adapting to what we see as the new forecast for DP&L, some of the FX and some of the tariffs in Brazil and just saying we want to be prudent, we want to overachieve whatever we give out there as guidance. So that's really what's causing this step-down of 2%. But I think that if you think of our portfolio, again if you take a longer period of view, we do have very competitive growth rates. I think that we provide the advantages of a diversified portfolio. Obviously, we're concentrated in fewer markets. You have less of this. But I do think -- and we have said from day 1 that we do think that we're in too many markets. And so we do want to focus, and then we can have all the advantages of a portfolio diversification. We don't have to be in 30 countries as where we started. So yes, do expect us to reduce, do expect us to become more efficient, as I think we're doing. I mean, we're -- we've reduced overhead. By next year, we'll be close to 25%. And the longer term, it's more like 1\/3. And that's just overhead in terms of managing these businesses. So regarding your question, I do think that we will provide compelling returns. We are in the right markets, markets where there's growth. Chile's growing 5% to 6%. Columbia is growing 5% to 6%, Panama is growing 8%. Even Brazil longer term is expected to be growing at 4% after 1.6% this year. So I think it's hard for you to find another portfolio that has these growth rates, and I think we have a clear strategy for executing on them. So yes, we're not where we want to be at the end, but we've certainly taken big steps in the right direction.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Also, just to clarify your return expectations over the next 3 years. The portfolio expansion opportunities that you guys highlighted in your slides, are those already baked into that growth rate as well?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, well, those are baked in. Now, of course, if there's other things that we can do in terms of some of the renewables that have shorter construction time periods, those are not in there.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","The only -- Ali, the only thing -- it's Tom -- I'd add is that of the growth that has not yet gone into construction, which is IPL and the 2 projects at Gener. IPL, we do get earnings between now and '15. They do have a neck [ph] -- a tracker where they get a current return on construction in progress. The 2 projects at Gener are not going to be earnings generators until '15 -- '16 and '17, respectively.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then separately, if my math is right, I think you've pretty much used up your current share buyback authorization with this last $49 million purchase. Is that right? And when should we expect an increase in that authorization or what's your thinking. I know you alluded to that. Tom, you did as well in your commentary. But when should we see some expansion of that authorization assuming that you still want to buy back more stock?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay. Well, your math is right. We did execute on our authorization. What I would say is just as I said in the past, we can always get, very quickly, an authorization to have more buybacks. But I would say if you go back to what I initially laid out a year ago, what we said is that we were going to buy back shares, we were going to strengthen our balance sheet by buying back debt and we were going to execute on some of the growth projects, so -- and pay the first dividend. So I think we're exactly executing on that. And so we have done share repurchases 4% from the starting point of total outstanding shares. And as Tom mentioned, we will now be focusing on deleveraging over the next short period. But I will make clear that for us to get an authorization to buy back more stock, we can do that on very short notice.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. One last question, one a bit of clarification. You alluded to TIPRA extension assumption. Was that just talking about 2012 and the $0.02 to $0.03 impact? Or is that baked in for the full to next 3-year outlook?","Thomas O'Flynn","Our guidance for '12 and our total return guidance or expectations through '15 do assume an extension of TIPRA. The $0.02 to $0.03 I talked about would just be the impact in '12 in the event it wasn't extended. It would be in the high single-digit number in the event it was not extended permanently. So that would be, let's say, a '13, '14 number. Now that's before other tax strategies that we can pursue. To be honest, that high single-digit number, let's call it $0.07, $0.08, yes, 6-month ago, that number would have been higher, but we continue to think about ways to mitigate. So a total TIPRA termination, if I can -- if that's technically correct, would, as we sit here today, on an ongoing basis would be in high single digits. But we've been very successful in mitigating that down and we'll continue to do that. I think in general, our view of -- there has been good support, in our view, of the election results last night. Just on a TIPRA-only basis is that the current administration, the Senate Finance Committee, Ways and Means, they've all generally been supportive of this. And if that same folks are generally coming back to their desks, then that's helpful to a TIPRA extension.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. And what I would say is 2 things. Remember when we talked first about the non-TIPRA extension at the beginning of the year, is we're talking about impacts of about $0.10 before mitigation. We've got it down to $0.02 or $0.03. And the second thing is remember, this is noncash, that we have $2 billion of NOLs. So yes, I -- we do expect it to be extended. But if it weren't, as Tom mentioned, we would be taking other measures to decrease that impact, and we think we can be successful to bring it down to sort of the range that we have this year for next year as well.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Right. And the $0.07 to $0.08, just lastly, that was an annualized number, Tom, you were thinking about?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, that would be an annualized number with no further mitigation. It would not be our -- as Andre said, that would not be our -- our expectation would be that we would have some further mitigations, as we have in the past.","Operator","Our next question, Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","The outlook for IPL, can you just elaborate on that, maybe quantify the level of CapEx to upgrade the several thousand megawatts of plants? And then just a little more detail on how the tracker works. Is that a return of and on the capital as it's spent on an annual basis?","Thomas O'Flynn","Sure, I'll hit that. It's Tom. The equity we expect to put in was about $300 million. The equity ratio, I think, is 45%. So that gets you around $650 million, $700 million, whatever that math works out to be. It would be about 3 years between '13 and '16. The tracker is a recovery of and on. I believe there's a modest delay. It could be 3- to 6-month delay in the mechanism. But it's a recovery of and on construction in process.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","And what's the ROE embedded in that?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","The ROE is embedded from the -- it's actually -- the WACC is from the last rate case, which is in the 90s. So it's a good WACC. And it's above what other utilities in the state are getting. I'll just leave it there. I would say separately, IPL, aside from the tracker, they may consider going in for a rate case over the next 18 months, just as they've done well in the regulatory structure. But maybe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","A couple of questions. Sorry, Tom, I was just hoping to follow up on your comment about going in for a case over the next 18 months. What was kind of the driver there at IPALCO?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, I'd say that's -- the major driver of the financials at IPALCO is their capital expansion, and the tracker keeps them in comfortable position. Andy may have more comments. So it's -- I'm probably getting ahead of the game in terms of talking about that in any kind of detail.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Yes, Gregg, this is Andy. I mean, the fundamental issue is that we managed in Indiana very well. We have a very constructive regulatory environment with the environmental trackers. We've managed our costs very well. We have the -- among the highest level of reliability in the state, and we have among the lowest cost of service in Indiana. I think that when we talk about the current investment that we have, which is to meet the federal regulations on hazardous emissions, that's not driving us anywhere near rates. We do have the tracker, and we believe the majority of those costs will be recovered, as Tom explained. It's pretty straightforward, and we've already submitted our certificate of public convenience and necessity and we're expecting that back relatively shortly. I think I mentioned on the last cost -- call what will make us think about whether we need to go into rates or not is how we deal with potential retirements of older coal units. We are looking at and still evaluating whether we may have to retire up to -- older small coal units, which represent about 15% of our generation. If we do that, we probably will have to bring on new capacity, either self-build or through the RFP process that we engaged in earlier. Once we come to that decision, we would only be able to recover costs associated with that expansion in a rate case. And that's really what's out there. And as we get further along that process, we'll update you probably in the next call where we are, but that's really what Ton was alluding to, the potential that if we deem -- have to do the retirements and we do add in capacity, at that point we will need to consider going through rates so we -- to recover on that investment.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then on -- sorry for the question, but on 2014 earnings, you kind of couched 2013 as below the modest growth, below the trend line that you're laying out. Given that there aren't a lot of megawatts coming online in '14, how do you see '14? Would that be below trend? And then catch-up in '15?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I think it's a little bit too soon for us to provide that guidance. But we do have, again as I mentioned earlier, some of our businesses such as U.S. wind, for example. By the end of '15, we'll be adding about $80 million of pretax contribution, or adjusted PTC, because -- due to the tax equity. So right now, it's too soon to give that. But obviously, if you have 1 year that's below, you're going to have other years that are above to get you to the average.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And sorry, last question. Just coming back to the $2 billion asset sale target, that was kind of laid out a year ago. How do you think about that at this point? Is that up for revision? Or what are your thoughts there?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. No, no, I would like to just make one clarification. I never said there was a $2 billion target. I always said that there was a universe of $2 billion and that we expect it -- to sell a high percentage of that but not 100% necessarily. So we never had a $2 billion target. Now in terms of the sales, I mean, I -- we did sell those. I think that we were in a good position to sell for very good multiples quickly, and I think our market timing was very good. Now looking forward, we're going to sell judiciously in the sense that we really want to maximize that -- the value of these. And I can give you just an illustration, is we could have sold and packaged all of our China assets, and we did have offers to sell it right away. But we took our time and sold to separate buyers, and we received a 40% premium versus the sort of altogether. And that's how we're going to continue with these asset sales. So I think that when we have several things under discussions that are -- and when we really do have something that we can bank on, then we will announce it. So we're working hard on this. But I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and say that we have something until we actually have it signed. So do I feel that if we reached, let's say, $1.7 billion or $1.5 billion, if we got the right prices, then that's probably the right amount. I think what's important is that we got as much value out of it. And the second thing, which is also very important, is do we end up with the optimal company. Do we have the assets that we can administer efficiently that help add to the whole in terms of our synergies and our scale? So what's really important is not just the amount of money that's coming in, but do we end up with the right company at the end of the process.","Operator","Our next question, Brian Chin with Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on the dividend. You gave a little bit of color that each year, you'd come looking at the dividend level and thinking about the appropriateness or the reasonableness of that. And then you mentioned the reference to the S&P 500 dividend yield, which is right now around 2%. Am I right in thinking that the next time you'd be thinking about that is sometime in the second half of next year? And what are some of the considerations that you're thinking of in terms of moving that dividend to an S&P 500 level or not?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, that's correct. But what we said is -- what Tom said is that we evaluate it as part of our normal process. This is our first dividend, and we will reevaluate it towards the second half of next year. We had always indicated moving towards more sort of an average for the S&P. And I also said that we had a lot of new businesses coming online and that we wanted to see how they all performed before reviewing this. So that was basically it. We're basically looking at what are our cash flows, how are the businesses performing. But I think our intention of giving a portion of our free cash flow back to our investors in the form of a dividend remains strong, and that those are -- that is our objective longer term.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Perfect. And then to -- just to be absolutely clear on this, the total return growth rate of 6% to 8%, that's based on a base year of 2012?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","That's correct. So some of the comments when you say in terms of how our growth rates compare, well, we're coming off a growth of 20%. So this is -- following 20%, we're saying 6% to 8%. And I also want to make clear that we're -- that -- we're including, of course, also the dividend as well. So that's our total return to shareholders.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. And then one last unrelated question. You had indicated that part of the reason why you were changing the growth outlook was DPL and what's going on with the new ESP and also different switching level assumptions. Can you clarify a little bit more? What level of retail switching are you assuming at DPL in your now new outlook? And can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing out there with regards to switching? I mean, we hear a lot of competitive dynamics coming from FirstEnergy and Exelon and other folks out there, in the space. So what are you guys seeing out there right now?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, I'll ask Andy Vesey. Answer that one?","Andrew Martin Vesey","Hey, Brian, it's Andy. Let me talk about our outlook on switching, and I want to sort of put this in the context of the ESP filing, which is essentially our view of Ohio. In the ESP filing, what we've done is we've locked in a view going forward of a switching rate of 62%. That is really what the switching was at the end of August. And we also had proposed somewhere through the AEP case a switching tracker so that fundamentally, we would be able to not have to forecast switching going forward, but that we would be held sort of neutral to switching rates going forward to the outcomes of the rate case. That said, most of the battle right now is around residential customers. We have seen an increase in residential customers switching. It's about 2.5% a month. We see, ending the year, probably around 75% switched. We're seeing most of the categories of customers, other than residential, reaching saturation levels. So that's really what we're seeing. It's mostly been increases in organic switching because I think a lot of the municipal aggregations have slowed down pending the outcome of all the cases and actually the elections that we've just had. So we anticipate that we're going to see continued very intense competition in the residential class. We see that potentially saturating long term at about 80% -- 86% switched. So where competition is intense, so as Andre said, we are replacing more customers than we've lost,  more load than we've lost. But clearly, it's an extremely competitive environment.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So given that you've embedded a rough 60% switching number plus the tracker in your assumptions and if you don't get that switching tracker and you believe saturation is closer to an 80%, then that might be one negative headwind down the road if you don't get that tracker in ESP?","Andrew Martin Vesey","Well, I think what we said is that we have -- if we don't reach a settlement on the new ESP, we would apply for a continuation of our current ESP for next year.","Operator","Our last question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I actually wanted to follow up on the DPL questions. So could you explain briefly what the issues are with this proceeding -- with the ESP proceeding? I understand that you have to file ESP and replace MRO, so that is extending the schedule. But I remember that in the past, you mentioned something about the separation or legal separation of the utility from generation assets and the debt financing that you used to do during the acquisition of the company. Could you talk specifically about that issue, how it links to the ESP negotiations?","Andrew Martin Vesey","Sure. Well, this is Andy, and I will talk a little bit about the first part of your question and let Tom talk about the issues around generation restructuring. Getting right to that piece, as you know, the issues that have been around the discussions in the beginning when we filed the MRO and have the settlement discussion, there are 3 main issues. It's time to market of our loads before competitive. It's been the non-bypassable charge. And emerging during those initial settlement discussions have been this question of legal separation of the generation assets even though we believe that the functional separation that we have today actually is fighting competition. What we've done in the filing is we addressed all these issues. We have made -- we are not asking for any approvals to separate generation in the current ESP filing. And as you know, we filed ESP on October 5. What we have done is we made a commitment in the current filing that we will come back by the end of the year with another filing specifically talking about the transition of generation and looking towards legal separation by the end of 2017. With that said, I think that answers part of the structural question. I'm going to ask Tom If he wants to answer the second part of your question.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, just in terms of the debt, obviously when we come back with that filing later this year, we'll talk about financial viability for the 2 business, especially the financial viability of a stand-alone generation company and also take into consideration what the appropriate time line is before that's a reasonable thing for us to do. In general, we've -- we do have debt at DPL, as you probably know, about $900 million at the DP&L level and about $1.7 billion at the DPL holdco level. At least for the next couple of years, we're in reasonably good shape on maturities. We do have a refinancing of about $460 million at DP&L utility next year, and then the first major refinancing for the DPL -- I believe it's August of '14 -- of $400 million-plus. So that's something that we'll look to get ahead on. Obviously, we -- you may have seen that we did have some discussions with the banks before our release last week on modifying some covenants, and that's consistent with our theme of trying to get ahead of things on the financing side.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, with that, I'll turn the call back to Ahmed.","Ahmed Pasha","We thank you, everyone, for joining us in today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any of your questions. Thank you, and have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. All lines may disconnect.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Allison. Good morning and welcome to AES' fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings call. Our earnings release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at Aes.com.","Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres?","Andres Gluski","Thanks, Ahmed and good morning, everyone. Today I would like to start this call with a brief review of 2015. Then I'll provide an update on the trends we're seeing across our portfolio, our action plans and the net impact of all these factors on our 2016 guidance and long term expectations. As you are all aware, we faced significant macroeconomic headwinds in 2015, including an average devaluation of nearly 30% on our non-U.S. dollar denominated businesses. We also faced the decline of more than 5% in demand at our distribution businesses in Brazil which is now in a deep recession. Both of these challenges are persisting in 2016 and we're taking actions to mitigate their impact on our financial results.","Nonetheless, we continued to execute well on our long term strategy to create sustainable shareholder value, simplifying our geographic footprint, improving our balance sheet and debt profile, fine-tuning our financial exposure by bringing in partners at the business and project level and profitably expanding our local platform. As a result of our consistent actions, in 2015, we were able to generate free cash flow of $1.24 billion, up 39% compared to 2014 and $66 million above the mid-point of our guidance range.","This was reflected in the $531 million of parent free cash flow we generated which is $8 million higher than 2014. And we increased our quarterly dividend for the third consecutive year to $0.11 per share, up 10% versus the previous year. Unfortunately, we were unable to overcome all of the $0.11 impact from macroeconomic headwinds we faced and our resulting adjusted earnings per share was $1.22, down from $1.30 in 2014. This was within our revised guidance range, but $0.03 below the low end of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.","Regarding capital allocation, we continued to return most of our discretionary cash to shareholders. Last year, we directed 62% of our discretionary cash towards share repurchases and dividends, specifically $481 million to share buybacks and $276 million to dividends. We also used $345 million or 28% of our discretionary cash to strengthen our balance sheet by pre-paying and refinancing corporate debt.","Our proactive steps over the past several years have put us in a strong liquidity position. Over the next three years, we only have $180 million of parent debt maturities and we've already made 85% of our capital contributions towards our 5.6 gigawatts of projects currently under construction. To secure our earnings and cash flow growth over the next couple of years, in 2015 we brought on-line 1.5 gigawatts of new projects and continue to make good progress on the remaining 5.6 gigawatts of construction projects. About 90% of these projects are U.S. dollar-denominated and either regulated or have long term PPAs. Finally, we advanced a few profitable platform expansion projects in California, Panama and the Philippines.","Now turning to slide 4 and our forecast for 2016. Over the last two years, currencies have devalued by as much as 40% to 55% and key commodities such as oil and gas have declined by 45% to 60%. The 2016 guidance we provided on our last call incorporated the impact from the macroeconomic factors I previously mentioned as of October 15.","Unfortunately, these negative trends have continued and based on our sensitivities to commodities and foreign currencies, we've seen additional impact of $100 million on proportional free cash flow and $0.10 on adjusted earnings per share this year. Tom will provide additional color on the main drivers and their effects in a few minutes.","Taking all of this into account, we expect to achieve at least 10% average annual growth in our free cash flow and 12% to 16% average annual growth in adjusted earnings per share through 2018, although all off a lower 2016 base. Our expectations for this growth is based on three factors, continued performance improvement, projects currently under construction and capital allocation decisions.","First, turning to slide 5, let us talk about continued performance improvement. As you may recall, since 2011, we have successfully implemented a cost cutting program which resulted in a 25% decrease in global overhead, equivalent to a run rate of $200 million of savings per year. Last quarter, we launched a new efficiency and revenue enhancement program to deliver an additional $150 million in savings per year by 2018. This new initiative includes further overhead cost reductions, procurement savings and operational efficiencies and improvements. We have already launched the programs that will allow us to realize $50 million in savings in 2016 and we're confident that we will realize $150 million in annual run rate by 2018.","Turning to slide 6, second, although we have directed the majority of our discretionary cash to share buybacks, debt repayments and dividends over the past four years, we have also been prudently investing in platform expansion projects together with financial partners. These growth projects are key to positioning AES for sustainable growth over the medium term, as well as maintaining our competitive edge. We're only investing in projects where we have an existing business, where we see attractive risk-adjusted returns and where we can attract financial partners.","Partnerships both reduce risk and enhance returns, as they provide an additional market read on our projects and often pay AES a promote or management fee. In fact, since 2011, we have raised more than $2.5 billion by incorporating financial partners on our construction projects and operating businesses. And as I said earlier and as you can see on slide 7, in 2015 alone we brought on-line six projects for a total of nearly 1.5 gigawatts and they were completed on time and on budget.","Turning to slide 8. We currently have an additional 5.6 gigawatts under construction, the majority of which are expected to come on-line through 2018 with an average return on equity of approximately 15%. The total cost of these projects is $7 billion and AES has already contributed 85% of its $1.2 billion in required equity contributions. A major milestone will be the completion of 1.6 gigawatts of environmental upgrades at our existing thermal generation plants at Indianapolis Power and Light. About 80% of our current construction pipeline is in the U.S. and Chile, where we're expanding our stable and U.S. dollar-denominated asset base at IPL and AES Gener.","Now on to slide 9. Over the past several years, we have experienced many of the disadvantages of having an international portfolio. However, one of the advantages is that having pruned our presence from 28 to 17 countries, most of the remaining emerging markets we're in continue to experience robust growth in energy demand, supporting the need for our product. In Panama, Vietnam, India demand growth over the next three years is expected to be in the 6% to 10% range, while in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and the Philippines growth is in the 3% to 5% range. One notable exception is Brazil, where demand for electricity dropped 5% in 2015 and we're not forecasting a recovery in levels of demand until 2018.","Now let me touch on a few advanced development projects that will drive our growth beyond 2018. Turning to slide 10, in the Philippines whereas I just mentioned demand growth is expected to remain at around 5%, we plan to break ground in the first half of 2016 on a 300 megawatt expansion of our 630 megawatt Masinloc facility. The $750 million project will be funded with a combination of partner equity, local debt capacity and free cash flow from the business in the Philippines.","Now turning to slide 11. In Panama, along with our local partner, Grupo Motta, we won a competitive bid for a 350 megawatt gas-fired combined cycle generation plant with a 10-year U.S. dollar PPA. Using this bid as an anchor, we plan to build 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility, very similar to the one we built and have successfully operated for 13 years in the Dominican Republic. The facility will be strategically located near the entrance of the Panama Canal, allowing it to serve as a ship fuel bunkering hub, as well as meeting unmet local and regional demand for natural gas. With the completion of the sister facility to our existing terminal in the Dominican Republic, we will be the largest LNG offtaker in the Caribbean and Central America. We expect to break ground this year and complete the project in 2018.","As you can see on slide 12, we've also achieved important milestones on the repowering of our Southland facility, where we were awarded a 20 year PPA by Southern California Edison for nearly 1.4 gigawatts of combined cycle natural gas generation and energy storage. We're making good progress on permitting and licensing and expect to break ground in 2017, with commissioning beginning in 2020.","Finally turning to slide 13, we continue to maintain our leadership of lithium ion-based battery energy storage. We currently have 106 megawatts in operation in four countries. We have another 60 megawatts under construction and a further 228 megawatts in advanced stage development in the U.S., Latin America and Asia, including 100 megawatts under contract in California.","In addition, to the nearly 400 megawatts that we have built or may build on our own business platform, we have reached important milestones towards third-party sales of our proprietary award-winning Advancion Energy Storage product. We recently signed an alliance agreement with the Mitsubishi Corporation to sell Advancion in Asia and Australia and a similar agreement with Eaton for select countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. As part of our drive to maintain the cost competitiveness of our product, we also signed an agreement with LG to supply batteries for our pipeline of energy storage projects.","In our current financial guidance, we do not include any material income from third-party sales of our Advancion project. We believe this is prudent, since our alliance-based business model is in its initial phases. Nonetheless, we believe that the global market for energy storage solutions is expanding rapidly and will be quite large within five years, as utilities respond to greater renewable penetration. AES's businesses in attractive markets around the world and our long term relationships with local regulators and customers, provide us with an unique advantage in opening the door to energy storage. We will keep you informed as our alliances progress.","Turning to slide 14, the third driver of our growth in per share cash flow and earnings, is our capital allocation strategy. Four years ago, we identified specific actions to improve total shareholder return, reduce risk and simplify our portfolio. Since then we have used 81% of our discretionary cash towards share repurchases, dividends and debt prepayments.","Since 2011, we have reduced our share count by 15% and our parent debt by 23%. We have completed timely exits from 11 countries and netted $3 billion in asset sale proceeds, including more than $500 million in 2015. As you can see on slide 15, since 2012 we returned $2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, including $757 million or 12% of our current market cap in 2015. While I have discussed our growth opportunities in some detail, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and reducing corporate leverage. With that, I will now turn the call over to Tom, to provide more color on our 2015 results and 2016 guidance.","Tom O'Flynn","Thanks Andres and good morning everyone. Today I'll review our full-year results including proportional free cash flow, adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU. Then I'll cover our 2015 capital allocation, our 2016 guidance and longer term expectations, as well as our 2016 capital allocation.","Turning to slide 17, full-year adjusted EPS of $1.22 was $0.08 lower than 2014. At a high level, we were impacted by the $0.11 impact from the roughly 30% average devaluation in foreign currencies primarily the Brazilian real and Colombian peso, lower operating results in Brazil due to lower demand and a general economic slowdown, as well as lower commodity prices particularly in the Dominican Republic. These negative drivers were partially offset by a reduction in share count of 6% of 40 million shares, lower parent interest expense and a slightly lower tax rate, as well as improved hydrology in Panama and the benefit of new businesses including Mong Duong in Vietnam.","Turning to slide 18, overall, we generated $1.2 billion of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $350 million from last year, even though operating margin was down. As expected, in the Dominican Republic or DR, we settled our outstanding receivables. And in Chile we recovered delayed VAT payments for the construction of Cochrane and Alto Maipo. We previously expected to be in the low end of our range, if the PPA amendment and collection of receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria did not close.","Although it's been delayed until 2016, we came in above the mid-point of our range as a result of improved collections and working capital improvements across our portfolio, some of which came late in 2015 rather than our prior expectation to collect in 2016. We also earned $1.15 billion in adjusted PTC during the year, a decrease of $171 million.","Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 19. In the U.S. our results reflect lower generation across our wind portfolio, lower contributions from IPL due to wholesale margins and the partial sell-down, as well as from DPL where a greater portion of the energy was sold into the wholesale versus the retail market. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections, lower inventory and a one-time contract termination payment at DPL in 2014.","In Andes, our results reflect higher margins as a result of improved availability in Chile and higher energy prices at Chivor in Colombia, partially offset by the 27% devaluation of the Colombian peso. Proportional free cash flow also benefited from increased VAT refunds. PTC also reflects the gain on restructuring at Guacolda in Chile.","In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins due to lower demand and the 29% devaluation in the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher interest expense, partially offset by the timing of energy purchases, lower tax payments and lower CapEx at Sul. PTC also includes the net unfavorable reversal of liabilities at Eletropaulo and Sul.","Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins as a result of lower LNG sales demand, ancillary service revenue and availability in the DR, partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama. Proportional free cash flow had a very strong increase from the collection of outstanding receivables in the DR, as well as favorable timing of collections in Puerto Rico and Panama.","In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 16% devaluation of the euro, the 20% devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge and the sales of our businesses in Nigeria and our wind business in the UK. Proportional free cash flow, however, was up due to higher collections in Bulgaria and Jordan. Lower PTC also reflects the reversal of a liability in Kazakhstan that was favorable in 2014.","Finally in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins as a result of the start of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam, as well as improved availability at Masinloc in the Philippines. Proportional free cash flow was negatively impacted by higher tax payments and the timing of collections and fuel payments at Masinloc.","Now to slide 25 and our parent capital allocation for 2015. Sources on the left hand side reflect the total available discretionary cash, roughly $1.6 billion which is about $140 million higher than our expectation. This is largely a result of the approximate 4% sell-down of Gener in the fourth quarter.","You may remember from our last call, that we expected additional asset sale proceeds of approximately $150 million in our 2016 capital allocation plan. We were able to close this in 2015 and now own approximately 67% of Gener, down from 71%. This brought our total asset sale proceeds for 2015 to $537 million. Parent free cash flow came in just above the mid-point of our range of $531 million.","Turning to uses on the right-hand side, we allocated 91% of our discretionary cash toward debt pay down and return to shareholders. Specifically, we used $345 million to refinance and prepay over $800 million of high coupon debt. This included reducing our overall debt by $240 million and the issuance of $575 million of 5.5% 10 year notes which further extended our maturities and lowered interest expense.","In addition to the dividend, we've invested $481 million in our shares. This brings total cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $757 million for 2015. Since our last call when we announced our $400 million authorization, we bought back $136 million including $79 million in 2016.","Turning to slide 26 and our 2016 guidance and 2017 and 2018 expectations. As Andres mentioned, our prior guidance was based on currency and commodity forward curves as of October 15. Bringing those curves forward to January 31, resulted an incremental impact of $0.10 on EPS or roughly $100 million. Our hedging activities have mitigated this impact by $0.03. Additionally since then, economic conditions in Brazil have also deteriorated by about $0.02. We've incorporated these impacts into our revised guidance.","Our 2016 proportional free cash flow guidance is now $125 million lower, with a revised mid-point of $1.175 billion. This reflects the $100 million in macro impacts I just discussed, as well as the fact that our 2015 proportional free cash flow benefited from the accelerated collections in the fourth quarter. Regarding parent free cash flow, we now expect 2016 to be $50 million lower, a mid-point of $575 million. Although this is below our previous expectation, it still represents roughly 10% growth relative to 2015.","In 2017 and 2018, we're still projecting at least 10% annual growth in cash flow, but off a lower 2016 base. Our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance is now $0.95 to $1.05 or $0.10 below our prior guidance with the mid-point of $1. In 2017 and 2018, we're maintaining our 12% to 16% growth rate, but off a lower 2016 base. However, we do expect to be in the higher end of that range.","Before turning to capital allocation, I want to provide updates on a couple of our businesses, beginning on slide 27. Regarding Maritza in Bulgaria, recent energy sector reforms have now been enacted, resulting in improvement in the financial position of our offtaker NEK. We saw evidence of this in 2015, as collections were 24% higher than 2014. We've also seen progress recently in the financing process of NEK's parent to raise the funds necessary to settle our receivables. That said, our guidance includes only a modest portion of the outstanding receivables we expect to collect.","Also this week, DPL filed its electric security plan which included a request for a reliability rider. Our plan tracks the criteria set out by the Public Utility Commission of Ohio which are designed to improve rate stability for customers, ensure continued reliability and promote fuel diversity in Ohio, while also ensuring the continued economic viability of DPL's plants based on a targeted 10.7% return on equity. We expect resolution of this filing later this year, with the outcome effective at the beginning of 2017. We remain on track to have our generation and wires businesses separated by that time.","Turning now to 2016 parent capital allocation on slide 29, sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash. This is roughly $50 million less than our prior expectation, reflecting lower parent free cash flow. Our discretionary cash could increase through additional funds from asset sales.","Turning to uses on the right-hand side of the slide, with 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, we're returning at least one-third of this cash to shareholders. Regarding debt reduction, improving our credit profile continues to be a priority. From a fixed income perspective, we benefit from lowering financing costs and ensuring access to capital. Equally important from an equity perspective, we think that continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for our growing cash flows and dividend.","Accordingly, we're targeting $200 million of debt reduction this year, over half of which we've already done. As an aside, we also continue to have good access to financial markets across our businesses which is still open for attractive projects at favorable terms, as we've seen recently with our advanced development projects and refinancings. As an example, just a couple of weeks ago we closed a 15 year nonrecourse financing for our Masinloc expansion project in the Philippines, an all-in cost of less of 5%.","We have earmarked $330 million for investments on our projects under construction, as well as our expansion projects at Southland in California and in Panama. We will also be injecting $75 million into Sul in Brazil in support of debt restructuring which will strengthen Sul's capital structure by paying down a portion of the $330 million in debt currently outstanding. The equity injection will also facilitate agreements to extend debt maturities to 2020 and 2021. We believe those meaningful value in the business above our equity contribution. And following debt this restructuring which we expect to close shortly, we will be assessing all strategic alternatives for Sul.","After considering these investments in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, we're left with roughly $170 million of discretionary cash to be allocated. As in years past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year. We'll continue to invest this cash consistent with our capital allocation framework. With that, I'll now pass it back to Andres.","Andres Gluski","Thanks, Tom. As we have discussed, the macro environment has been and continues to be challenging. However, our strategy will allow us to weather the unfavorable macroeconomic environment. And just as importantly, it will allow us to continue to reposition our portfolio in spite of near term headwinds. Furthermore, we will be able to capture the financial upside, when these trends reverse.","In the meantime, our portfolio generates strong and growing free cash flow. And consistent with our track record, we will continue to cut costs, streamline our business and allocate our discretionary cash to maximize value for our shareholders. With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So a quick question here, in terms of target leverage. You've talked a lot about debt repayment this morning and just broader debt paydown strategies. What's your ultimate target ratios as you guys sit here today? Has it evolved much?","Andres Gluski","Well, I would say the first -- we paid down about $1.5 billion of debt over the past four years, so we've been very consistent in this. And so, every time we sell-down something, we also pay down some debt. Now let's say our target is to have sort of -- I would say, thinking longer term like 2019, 2020 to have sort of investment grade-like statistics and be like a strong BB by 2018.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And how much debt -- further debt pay down you need to do? I mean, are on track with your current trajectory of debt pay down? Or what's the total quantum per year you would need to get there, to be clear?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, Julien, this is Tom. I'd just add -- to be consistent what we said in the past, I think we said, maybe $100 million to $200 million a year. This year, we're on the high end of that range, $200 million. I think if we're hitting our numbers, then $100 million a year would be appropriate. But we believe would generally stick, at least for the next couple of years, 2017 to 2018, with a range of $100 million to $200 million.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. But you would hit IG, if at that pace?","Tom O'Flynn","We would hit IG stats. The ratings are obviously a broader issue. But if you look over a three, five-year period, we would hit IG stats over that horizon","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then just following -- a couple little items, just in terms of setting expectations. Do you expect asset sales -- is there any reason to think about that for this year? And then, also in terms of the new assets that you announced, the Masinloc 2, the Panama combined cycle, what are the specific EPS contributions from each of those plants once they reach in-service, at least in your initial expectation?","Andres Gluski","Okay. Regarding asset sales, what we've said is that we think on average, we'd been selling around $200 million-plus per year. Last year, we did a bit more, we did $500 million. I think the way to think about it -- we will exit certain markets when we think the time is right, but we'll also sell-down positions to get partnership money to reinvest it in these new projects.","Now regarding the EPS contributions, what we've said is that on average, our projects will have a return on equity -- so the first three years of full operation of around 15%. It's going to vary a lot project by project, but I think what's important is we have -- are repositioning this portfolio. 90% of the new projects of that sort of 7 gigawatts that we've had, are U.S. dollar denominated, 80% of the new projects are in the U.S. and Chile. So we're repositioning this portfolio to be more contracted, more dollar-based and in countries with strong markets.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And quick last question, the EBITDA you provide in -- for DPL, is that reflect any above market assumptions for the ESP in forward years?","Andres Gluski","What we provided in there for the reliability rider, as we said in the past, it's incorporated into our numbers and it is a modest increase, versus what we had as a non-bypassable [ph] in the past.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","My first question, what is your confidence level in the revised earnings outlook for 2016? Given the ongoing global turmoil, how much cushion have you given yourselves, if things get even worse than at right now?","Andres Gluski","Yes. Well, we always give guidance based on sensitivities and based on commodities and based on FX at a period in time. So we feel very confident that we can deliver this, based on those numbers. If you have a further deterioration, we have the sensitivities.","Now we have also engaged in some hedging which Tom can talk about, to lessen that. I think that if you look over the years, we've always outperformed our guidance based on the numbers at the beginning of the year. What has happened is that the commodities and FX have moved in a negative direction.","Ali Agha","Okay. I guess, a second question on Brazil. There has been some stories suggesting potential exit from maybe Eletropaulo Sul. You alluded to Sul in your comments. Can you give us a sense what you are looking at there in Brazil? And maybe bigger picture, if you are not looking for an exit, what is the strategic rationale for staying there, given the disproportionately negative impact that Brazil has to your overall stock and valuation, given such a small contribution to earnings, given the outlook that is not looking any positive, why are you in Brazil?","Andres Gluski","Let's step back a little bit. Since about 2006, when I got involved in Brazil to date, we've sold down probably about 70% of Eletropaulo. Until the last two years, Brazil actually was a pretty good contributor to our earnings and cash flow. Now I agree that the prospectus for Brazil -- for 2015, was a terrible year. I think 2016 is going to be bad. We don't expect a recovery in energy demand until about 2018. This is true.","But I think you have to remember, that we only own16% of Eletropaulo. At today's market valuation, that's about $60 million of equity positions, it's relatively small. It's a publicly-listed company, so we're not going to comment on it. But I would say that we've been consistent in our strategy of let's say, of focusing our position in Brazil. And for example, when there was sort of an -- asset prices were high. There was a lot of pressure on us from -- to lever up Tiete and buy assets. We never did, because we never thought that those were good investments.","So looking at the good, big picture for Brazil, we have 2,006 megawatts of hydro. They are very well-contracted over the next couple of years, at much higher than today's spot prices. I thinking in the future, it's going to be hard to get that kind of hydro assets at a reasonable price. So Brazil, again is in tough times. It's going to take some time to work its way out of it. But on the other hand, I think we have to take a longer term perspective of the AES' presence in Brazil, not referring to any specific asset.","Ali Agha","But the comment on regarding Sul, Andres does that apply to distribution exposure in general in Brazil? Which in the past you've said has been a challenging market for you?","Andres Gluski","Again I said, we've -- I'm not going to comment on Eletropaulo, it's a publicly traded company. But regarding Sul, referring to Tom's speech, we're going to look at all strategic alternatives. With the refinancing, with this capital injection and refinancing, this will give us a year's grace. And we will look at alternatives of how to make Sul more efficient and what makes the most sense for our shareholders.","Ali Agha","Okay. Last question, sort of more bigger picture, at what point would you be willing to step back and look dispassionately at the portfolio, Andres and perhaps followed the logic that some of us espouse, that the sum of the parts may be greater than the whole and does it make sense to maybe look at unlocking equity value, by perhaps breaking up some of the pieces of this Company? Would with ever occur in your mind or what's your thinking --?","Andres Gluski","Well, I think it certainly has occurred. I think we been very dispassionate. I mean, we've sold one-third of this portfolio. And I think that, if you go back and look at the prices we sold at and the timing, I think overall, we'd have to get a pretty good grade. So we always look very dispassionately -- we work for shareholders.","What we're doing I think in many cases, is capturing a lot of that value through our partnerships and using that money to reposition this portfolio. So we will look at all alternatives. We've always said that. I think maybe a year ago, yieldcos were in fashion. A lot of people were saying, why don't you do a yieldco?","We really thought that we -- from a fundamental point of view and that's how we always look at things, dispassionately and fundamentally, that partnerships made more sense. They were cheaper. They didn't create obligations for new investments and we think that strategy has played out. So certainly, we have an open mind and from time to time, we look at this.","But it has to be something that, really fundamentally unlocks the value and is not something perhaps that's -- I don't know what the word would be, in style or with other people -- we're always open to look at all alternatives. I think we been very dispassionate, in terms of our sale decisions. And we always look at things, again from a fundamental point of view, whether that's investing new money. If we put new money in, for example into Sul, it's because we think that there is significant equity value there. So we do not have some emotional attachments to specific businesses.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Turnure of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Turnure","Going back to the balance sheet, I wanted to get an update -- or first, I guess, just clarify comments that you made to one of the earlier questions on your deleveraging intent, kind of slowly over time through the end of the decade here. Has anything really changed there over the past 6 or 12 months or so, as a result of Forex and commodity prices and some of the pressures that you've been under? Because it sounds to me like you're trying to paint a relatively consistent message here?","And then conversely also, on debt capacity at some of your subsidiaries, could you talk about and just give us an update on Tiete and where that $500 million of capacity stands today? And then, maybe also any incremental availability at Gener or in Europe?","Tom O'Flynn","No, I think, our overall credit improvement comments are consistent with what we've said. And when we say, our credit ratio and credit statistic improvement, there's two ways to get there, the numerator and the denominator. We think more of the improvement will be in the numerator, i.e. parent free cash flow goes up which is the distributions from subs is obviously a numerator that we look at the most, for health of our parent credit. So we do expect growth, as we've talked about the 10% or more growth in parent free cash flow is driven by subsidiary distributions.","So it's more the reducing debt and interest cost is a smaller part of the story, but it is part of the story. So I think just going back to what I said to Julien, I think we'll do $200 million this year. I think as we see it now, probably do $100 million each of the next two years. And that's consistent I think, with what we said over the last 6 to 12 months which is about $100 million to $200 million a year. It's also pretty consistent with what we did last year. If you look at the debt we paid down, some of it was attributable to asset sale proceeds.","But about $150 million, $175 million was attributable to -- in our minds, just paying down debt and trying to continue to advance our credit story. And once again, we think that we can get investment grade type stats over, let's call it 4 to five-year period, on a gradual step. I think we're -- the facts and the pathway is pretty consistent. I think it's more of a focus let's say, certainly senior management, also at the Board level, because we certainly are paying out a pretty healthy dividend. We've got 10% growth and we really want to get shareholders to be comfortable in the stability and growth trajectory. And we think improving our credit will be part of that picture.","Just the other thing -- quickly to touch on, yes, Tiete does still have about $500 million of debt capacity. Like all of our Brazilian utilities, they've got a debt to EBITDA coverage and they have very modest debt. So about $500 million would be available under their overall debt docs. I might be a little cautious about that number today, just because Brazil is a challenging place. But they certainly do have debt capacity and as we look to grow at Tiete, it would be with that debt capacity.","We do have other -- I mean, in general around our subs, we do look to optimize our businesses. Gener is BBB- right now, I think it's, given the construction program, we don't see a lot of incremental capacity from Gener, but throughout certainly past Alto Maipo, yes, there is. But we do look at debt capacity around the business. One place is in Masinloc, where we're increasing the plant -- the facility side by 50%, with the 300 megawatt increment. That is being done through a financing that joins the credit of existing Masinloc with new Masinloc, that very much minimizes the amount of equity we have to put in. The same story we did in the DR. We did at DR a $260 million project, basically put no equity in, because the new project was stapled to the old one. So we leveraged available debt capacity in that fashion.","Andres Gluski","Chris, what I would add, is just to remind everybody, I think our debt is in very good shape. I think Tom and his team have done a great job. At the parent side, we only have $180 million of maturities at the parent and that's in 2018. So we have no maturities at the parent this year or next. And at the subs, 95% of the debt and the functional currency of that business and at the parent 90% is fixed.","So this is consistent with what we've been doing. I mean, we have been repositioning this debt to put ourselves in a strong position. When you, for example, you had a tightening of credit over the last couple of years in global market, it's not affecting us. So this is consistent with that philosophy. It is just that, as these new projects come on-line, where we can give more guidance, in terms of the strengthening of our credit into the next couple of years.","Chris Turnure","And then, my follow-up is on the overall outlook for 2016 to 2018. Obviously, Forex and commodities have hit you guys pretty hard. And you also mentioned a reduced outlook for demand growth in Brazil on the utility side, as weighing on your outlook versus the last update. Are there any other drivers there, that we should think about better meaningful in the aggregate?","Andres Gluski","No. I mean, those are the drivers. As we said, it's commodity prices, it's oil, it's gas, it's FX and it's growth in Brazil. And quite frankly other than Brazil, all of our other markets are growing. Argentina could be flat this year, but we expect a good growth in Argentina 2017 and 2018.","Operator","Our next question will come from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","I wanted to go back to Brazil. I recall during the EEI, you guys mentioned that you seem to have a pretty significant hydro exposure in the country, both on the TSS side and the utility side. Tiete does have some debt capacity. We seem to be heading to a potential asset sale by other market participants. Do you think it would make sense for you to bulk up on your generation assets on the hydro assets in Brazil or in South America in general? Or would you rather be more conservative and just continue to return cash to investors and not to double-down, especially in Brazil?","Andres Gluski","I would say that, thinking about the other people selling some assets in Brazil, we really aren't looking at something -- like a large acquisition in Brazil. I can say that, no, we would take a more conservative position on that. And you are also right, that one of the risks, we want to measure and control really of course, is hydrology in Brazil. We have changed our contracting structure.","There's a lot of water this year in South and south east of Brazil, so that spectre of rationing is gone, also with the drop in demand. We've also fortunately I think, had done a good job, the team has done a good job in terms of contracting at Tiete over the next couple of years. So we have prices around 150 reais, 149 reais per megawatt hour and the spot market, because of all the rain and the drop in demand is as low as 30 to 40 reais. So we're in a good position there. But answering your questions, strategically we do not see doing a large -- sort of doubling up as you put it, on hydro risk in Brazil.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And now a different topic, Ohio. So you've just filed your ESP. Similar to all the other utilities you're asking for a PPA for your Ohio coal plants. Now we're likely to have a FERC review of those PPAs with the other players. Now what is your expectation of -- about the future of these assets, if FERC were to somehow challenge the PPAs of the remaining two companies? Would you expect, for instance, Ohio to potentially fully re-regulate its power market?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, Angie, it's Tom. I'd say what we filed in Ohio was a reliability rider, so we're thinking about it from a different perspective than a couple of the other in-state folks. So we would be less focused on their situations at this point. We just filed it. It's generally, obviously, something we'll would expect to get resolved this year. We think it hits the points that I mentioned in my script. It's consistent with the PCO criteria and objectives. It would provide stability for a long period of time and we also think it would provide benefits to rate payers over the 10 year period.","The numbers are slightly -- what we filed for is slightly better, than our -- than what we have now in our ESP. I'd say, we'd incorporate something into our guidance, but I'd rather stay away from specifics of what has been incorporated in our guidance. But we do think the plants continue to have an economic value and that is certainly for the 10 year period. And it's based just on the four -- on our coal plants which is about $1 billion of rate base.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to discuss trends, in terms of where AES parent is receiving distributions from its subsidiaries in 2015 and beyond? Could you talk to the trends in terms of changes over time, relative to what we saw in 2015, in terms of where the cash actually came from?","Andres Gluski","I'll go ahead and pass that over to Tom. But basically our big contributors are Andes and U.S., have been our big contributors. Asia growing somewhat, because as Mong Duong comes on. But Tom, perhaps you can give a more specific answer?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, Steve, how are you? We got some detail in the back of our deck in the appendix. I think 46 has some detail and there's also some more -- that's by SBU. In general, I think our distributions follow our largest areas. It's the U.S., as well as Andes. MCAC was a big contributor last year, especially with the collection catch-up in the Dominican Republic that we spoke about.","And I think that over time, distributions generally follow proportional free cash flow and earnings. There may be some timing off by year. Often our companies will pay out dividends based on prior year's earnings, so sometimes there's a lag of a bit. But I think generally, our distributions are quite close to proportional free cash flow, in PTC.","Andres Gluski","Steve, the one thing we maybe -- if we had the full collection from Bulgaria, this would be an upside, because we only include a modest amount of money from Bulgaria and so, we've taken a conservative approach regarding. And as Tom mentioned, recent developments have been very encouraging in Bulgaria.","Stephen Byrd","So if BEH is able affect the financing and you are paid as you should be, then there could be further upside in 2016 in terms of distributions?","Andres Gluski","That's correct. That's correct, in terms of parent free cash flow, yes","Stephen Byrd","Okay. And I presume you don't want to lay out exactly the magnitude of that, at this point, in terms of the incremental?","Andres Gluski","I would say, in terms of our guidance, we'd be at the upper end of the range, for the proportional and the parent free cash flow that we'd get in Bulgaria. I would mention that, in terms of encouraging news, the Minister of Energy yesterday came out and said, that they had -- there are two phases to it.","The first is, that the BEH, Bulgarian Energy Holdings would receive a bridge loan from banks for later on take-out. As she mentioned yesterday, that they had received significant offers from one of the bank consortiums -- I think expect two or three to come in. And that's very favorable, because we'd get paid with the bridge loan and we wouldn't have to wait for the bond operation. So that really, again that's a favorable development. Let's wait and see. If that does occur, that would -- and given that everything else happens as we expect, we would be at the upper end of the range.","Stephen Byrd","Just wanted to follow up, shift over to Latin America and just get your sense at a high level of buyer appetite, ability to finance acquisitions, et cetera, for I guess, Latin America overall and Brazil in particular, is it your sense that there is a viable buyer universe out there or is it a little challenging, given what we're seeing in terms of deterioration in places like Brazil? What's your sense?","Andres Gluski","I would really segment Brazil, from the rest of Latin America right now. I would say that Brazil is in a recession. But if you look at the rest of Latin America, its growth rates are actually higher than the U.S. So if you look at Columbia, Chile, Mexico -- Panama is growing at I think about 7%. Dominican Republic is growing, so I would segment Brazil from the rest.","So for the rest, I think in most places, yes, there definitely is a market. Even in a place like Argentina, we're seeing greater investor interest, because a lot of the moves that the government has taken, are seen very favorably. I personally was down in Argentina. I can say, it's one of the most impressive executive teams I've seen anywhere, anytime. So they've already started to liberalize tariffs and rationalize prices.","But if you get to Brazil itself, I think that these assets are definitely sellable. I think it depends on the asset. There is still appetite. There is still local groups who have the capacity to buy this. There is still a lot of plays of consolidation in the sector and you have foreign investors. You have Italians, Spanish investors, who are on the look-out -- and French who are on the look-out for assets. So I would say that even though Brazil is the market that's not growing and at the same time I think for quality assets, there are definitely buyers. The price may not be what it was two years ago for sure, but again, that's reflected in market valuations.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gregg Orrill from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill","Just to follow-up on the Bulgaria discussion, what's in your 2016 earnings guidance from Bulgaria?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, 2016 has an expectation that we settle here in the near term which would be our 14% reduction in tariff. So just from a PTC perspective and the PTC for the year is about $90 million to $100 million which is a little bit down from last year. I think last year, PTC was around[$115 million, $120 million. So it's a little bit down this year. Just from a pure PTC perspective, actually delay in the resolution payment and closing of our PPA adjustment helps PTC. Obviously, a top priority is to get that done -- which gets us on the right path forward and obviously helps proportional free cash flow and parent free cash flow, but bottom line this year it's about[$90 million, $95 million PTC","Gregg Orrill","So is the read that you feel your cash flow assumption is conservative?","Tom O'Flynn","I'd say in that respect, yes, our proportional free cash flow assumption would be conservative. It's a fairly modest amount that we have included, if you look at our mid-point, would be a fairly modest Bulgaria amount. So yes, if that gets done and Andres gave some color that the signs are certainly turning towards the positive here. If that gets done, then we could well be towards the higher end of our proportional free cash flow range.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, everybody for joining us on today's call.

Sir, you may begin.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Tim. Good morning, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call of The AES Corporation. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at AES.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will focus my comments on 3 areas: Our operating performance and progress on our strategic objectives during the second quarter; an update on a couple of our key businesses; and a review of our most important initiatives to maximize the value of our portfolio.","Turning to Slide 4. Our financial results for the quarter were in line with our expectations. We increased our adjusted earnings per share by $0.14 to $0.32. Our continued focus on improving operational performance and reducing corporate overhead contributed significantly to our results for the quarter. We achieved these results despite a $0.05 impact from the worst hydrology in Latin America in many decades. With our year-to-date results, we're on track to achieve our full year guidance on all metrics. Tom will discuss our financial performance and guidance in more detail. In addition to solid financial results, we made continued progress towards our 3 main strategic objectives.","Turning to Slide 5. Our first strategic objective is to improve profitability. As you may remember, we committed to a reduction of $145 million in overhead cost by 2014 relative to 2011. During the quarter, we reduced our G&A expense by another $15 million from last year. Based on our progress so far, I'm pleased to report that we have accelerated our efforts and expect to achieve $135 million this year, which is $15 million higher than our prior forecast. Over the last 2 years, we've reduced our G&A by more than 1\/3.","Our second strategic objective is to narrow our geographic and business focus. As you can see on Slide 6, since May, we have sold 2 additional assets for net equity proceeds of $56 million. We sold our 10% stake in a gas-fired plant in Trinidad, which was not an attractive market for us, given its small size and lack of growth opportunities. The sale of 48 megawatts of wind turbines, which we had held in storage, was purely a commercial decision as we did not find an attractive project for these older technology machines. These 2 transactions bring our total sales proceeds year-to-date to approximately $230 million, just under 50% of our 2013 target of $500 million, which we expect to achieve.","Since September 2011, we have closed the sale of 16 businesses for total proceeds of $1.1 billion. We have exited 7 countries and are now present in 21, down from 28 2 years ago. We are working hard to further simplify our portfolio by continuing to exit those markets and businesses where we do not have a compelling competitive advantage. We will keep you posted as soon as we are able to disclose specific additional transactions.","Turning to Slide 7. Our third strategic objective is to optimize capital allocation, aiming to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. As we've said in previous calls, when making investment decisions, we require the various uses of discretionary cash to compete against one another, including delevering, returning cash to shareholders and investing in platform expansions.","Earlier this year, when we discussed our 2013 capital allocation plan, we indicated that debt reduction was a significant priority for us. To that end, during the second quarter, we successfully completed $1.8 billion in parent debt refinancing and delevering, including $300 million of recourse debt prepayment. As a result of these transactions, we have extended the average term of our recourse debt to about 7 years and lowered our interest expense by $50 million. Overall, we have prepaid more than $1 billion of debt in the last 2 years.","With respect to the stock buyback, we have been indicating that our discretionary cash would be back-end loaded this year. However, when our stock price recently softened, we bought back 5.3 million shares at an average price of $11.81, for a total investment of $63 million. At present, we have a remaining share buyback authorization for 237 million.","This September 2011, we have repurchased 39 million shares or approximately 5% of our shares outstanding at an average price of $11.58, for a total investment of $453 million. As well as share repurchases, we have implemented an annual dividend of $0.16 per share. We remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks, in addition to creating long-term value by investing in select platform expansion opportunities. Later on this call, Tom will update you on our capital allocation plans for the rest of the year.","Now I'd like to give you a brief update on 2 of our businesses to address some of the questions we're hearing from investors. Turning to Slide 8, in Bulgaria, a new government was put in place following the election in May. As some of you may know, the prior government was forced out due to social unrest, partly driven by protests over the perception of high energy prices. We continue to honor all of our obligations under our PPA and expect other parties to do the same. Maritza is an important business for us, and we are closely monitoring the situation in Bulgaria. We have also been in constructive discussions with our offtaker, NEK, and the new Bulgarian government. Our objective is to preserve the value of our contract, and we will keep you informed if there are any further developments.","Next, turning to Slide 9, and DP&L's ESP proceeding. We have not yet received the final counter [ph] approval. All of the key milestones in the process have been completed, including prefiled testimony, the hearing and the post-hearing briefing. The only remaining item is for the commission to issue its decision. We don't believe that there are any significant issues pending with the commission and expect that we will receive our new tariff in the near future.","Lastly, now on Slide 10, I would like to share a few thoughts on how we are creating more value for our shareholder. First, we're engaging partners for both our existing businesses and new growth projects to tailor our risk exposure, reduce capital requirements, leverage strategic relationships and maximize our return. This approach allows us to undertake larger projects, to extract greater synergies and economies of scale while managing the equity exposure we have on any particular project, technology or market. Partners provide an additional market test and can pay or promote our management fee, which further increases our returns by up to 200 basis points.","We have already closed several partnerships of this type, Cochrane in Chile, Mong Duong in Vietnam, and we recently signed a similar agreement with the Antofagasta Minerals mining company to take a 40% stake in the 531-megawatt Alto Maipo hydro project. Antofagasta Minerals also signed a 20-year power purchase agreement for 160 megawatts. We're now in the process of raising nonrecourse financing for Alto Maipo and expect construction to begin later this year.","For the same reasons, we're also looking more broadly at opportunities in our portfolio to monetize the value of certain assets through partial sell-downs and contract optimizations.","Second, asset sales are an important component of our plan to reposition our portfolio to improve returns and reduce overall risk. We will continue to exit markets and businesses where we do not have or cannot develop a compelling competitive advantage. In addition to the $1.1 billion in asset sales we have already completed, we see the potential for another $900 million in asset sales within the next 2 years. Any net proceeds from portfolio rationalization will be deployed in a manner consistent with our capital allocation framework.","Third, we see additional opportunities to optimize our assets and further streamline our cost structure. For example, we're improving the efficiency of our operations through our continuous improvement program, APEX, and further leveraging our global scale in procuring equipment, chemicals, insurance and fuel.","We're also evaluating opportunities across our fleet to standardize equipment and processes and to improve the cost effectiveness of our operations. These opportunities include closing the cycle at Los Mina in the Dominican Republic, adding fogging technology where appropriate to our CCGTs, studying ways to reduce inventories and lower business interruption costs through our transformer loss control program. For this program, we have designed and built a multiuse transformer, which can be ready for quick deployment should a transformer failure occur at a key facility. It is important to note that despite all of our cost-saving initiatives, the company's safety and operational indicators are the best they have ever been. And this year, we won our third consecutive EEI International Edison Award for operational innovation and improvement.","Finally, in my view, AES has an unmatched footprint in many key markets where demand for electricity is expected to grow for the foreseeable future. Our growth is largely focused on expanding our platforms in such markets. In Chile, where we are seeing some of the highest levels of power demand growth in our portfolio, there's a limited pipeline of permitted new projects. We recently started construction on the 532-megawatt Cochrane coal-fired plant. And as I previously explained, we're making good progress on the 531-megawatt Alto Maipo hydro project.","In the Philippines, where GDP growth continues in the 5% range, we're advancing on the development of Masinloc 2. We are securing the necessary permits and EPC contracts, while working to secure a long-term PPA for 300 to 600 megawatts to support the expansion.","In India, GDP growth is still expected to be more than 5%. We believe that the 1,320-megawatts OPGC II expansion project, with its own dedicated source of low-cost coal, will be a competitive plant in the Indian power market. We continue to work closely with our partner, the state government of Odisha, to complete the remaining development milestones.","In Vietnam, construction on our 1,240 Mong Duong project remains on budget and on time for 2015 commissioning. Although it is not one of our rapidly growing markets, at IPL in Indiana, we will upgrade 2,400 megawatts of baseload coal-fired generation to comply with MATS, and we are developing a 600-megawatt CCGT power plant. Approximately 55% of this $1.1 billion future increase in rate space will be financed with nonrecourse debt at the IPL level.","In addition to these large development projects, we also see opportunities to leverage our existing infrastructure by offering adjacent services. For example, in California, Chile and the Dominican Republic, we're assessing leveraging our platform to provide desal capabilities at our existing plants to deliver water to local industrials. While these programs are individually fairly small, such projects can be leveraged across our businesses and completed fairly quickly, as they utilize existing infrastructure and do not require significant development spend.","In summary, I am pleased that we are making good progress on a number of fronts that will result in sustainable earnings growth and improved returns on our invested capital.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom, who will discuss our financial performance and 2013 outlook in more detail.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. We're on track for the year, and we're reaffirming our guidance on all metrics. Today, I'd like to review our second quarter results, including adjusted EPS, results by SBU and proportional free cash flow, then I'll discuss our 2013 guidance and capital allocation updates.","Turning to Slide 12. Hydrology has been a challenge across several of our SBUs. On a proportional basis, 12% of our installed capacity is hydro. We've seen very dry conditions in many of our markets. During the second quarter, we had a $0.05 drag and poor hydrology across our portfolio, including in Panama, Colombia, Chile, Brazil and Turkey. This brings our year-to-date impact from poor hydrology to $0.08 per share. The situation has improved, but based upon current reservoir levels, we expect another $0.04 impact in the second half, bringing the full year hydrology impact to $0.12 a share. This is an increase of $0.06 relative to our expectations as of the end of the first quarter.","We are, however, seeing some recovery. Hydrology and reservoir levels in Brazil are nearing a normal range at this point. It's currently the rainy season in both Panama and Colombia where water inflows are roughly 20% to 30% below historical levels, that we've seen some improvement in Colombia over the last few weeks. Critical point is that we're offsetting these impacts with other opportunities in our portfolio and reaffirming our guidance. I'll touch on the specifics in a moment.","Now to Slide 13. Adjusted EPS increased $0.14 for the second quarter. Net of the $0.05 impact from dry conditions, operational improvements at the SBUs contributed $0.05, driven by Gener in Andes, Uruguaiana in Brazil and the Dominican Republic and El Salvador businesses in MCAC. I'll cover the specifics of each SBU, but first, let me touch on taxes.","As you may recall, we anticipated some tax favorability this year as we assumed a full year tax rate of roughly 27%. This rate implied about $0.03 of favorability for the second quarter. However, our year-to-date rate is 20%, benefiting from geographic income mix and timing within the year of certain tax benefits and expenses. Further, we favorably resolved some outstanding tax items during the quarter. Collectively, these items added another $0.03, bringing the total quarterly tax benefit to $0.06 a share. Finally, for the quarter, we saw a $0.03 benefit from lower G&A to parent and lower share count.","Now I'd like to review the operating drivers of adjusted pretax contribution, or PTC, for each of our SBUs during the quarter. As a reminder, PTC is essentially pretax earnings adjusted for one-time gains or losses on unrealized derivatives in foreign currency, dispositions and losses on retirements of debt and impairments. We currently don't make these adjustments for our small number of equity method investments but expect to begin making these adjustments in the third quarter.","Turning to Slide 14 in the U.S. We reported a modest decline of $9 million PTC, mostly are utilities. This is consistent with our expectations for the year. At DPL, we experienced continued pressure on margins from lower capacity prices and customer switching. A 65% of the load at DP&L has switched to competitive providers. At IPL, retail demand was down due to milder weather during the early summer months. And in Andes, we reported an increase for the quarter of $36 million in PTC, despite the impact of low hydrology in Chile and Colombia. The growth was driven by a new Ventanas IV facility, a 270-megawatt coal-fired project in Central Chile, which achieved COD in March of this year. Additionally, we benefited from higher availability in Chile in contrast with significant outages at Gener last year.","In Brazil, PTC increased $23 million for the quarter, largely due to a favorable reversal of a provision at Uruguaiana. As you may remember, when Uruguaiana's gas supply was curtailed several years ago, we brought an arbitration against YPF, a former gas supplier now controlled by the government of Argentina. This quarter, we won the arbitration on the merits and reversed the provision we had previously recorded. This development was worth $26 million in PTC or about $0.03 and was consistent with our expectations. We believe this step in the arbitration process will help us resolve the dispute with YPF and bring this plant back into permanent service.","Retail was flat for the quarter. On the utility side, Eletropaulo improved for the quarter as a result of the tariff reset catch-up provision recorded in the second quarter of last year, so a decrease for the quarter is a result of its tariff reset which was finalized in April of this year.","Now MCAC on Slide 15. We had an increase of $10 million in PTC for the quarter despite the impact of low water inflows in Panama. We recorded higher spot volumes in the Dominican Republic and a higher tariff in El Salvador as a result of the tariff reset approved by the regulator in late 2012.","At EMEA, during the quarter, PTC increased modestly by $7 million. This was a result of higher margin in the United Kingdom due to improved availability at Ballylumford and higher dark spreads at Kilroot. These were partially offset by the impact of an unrealized derivative loss of $0.02 in Turkey, which as I mentioned earlier, as of the second quarter, is not excluded from adjusted EPS because Turkey is one of our few equity method investments.","Finally, turning to Asia. PTC declined $15 million for the quarter, consistent with our expectations. As you may remember, Masinloc is a long-term contract starting this year at prices moderately below last year's spot levels to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility.","Now to cash flow on Slide 16. We generated $148 million of proportional free cash flow this quarter. Year-to-date, we're at about $500 million or 56% of our 2013 guidance midpoint. The quarter-over-quarter decline of $65 million was largely driven by lower operating cash at Gener, which had a value-added tax refund last year. In addition, we recorded higher environmental capital expenditures at IPL and Gener, consistent with our expectations for the year.","Now I'll cover guidance on Slide 17. As I said, we're reaffirming 2013 guidance. Year-to-date, we've earned about 45% of our adjusted EPS, midpoint of $1.28, which is consistent with our expectations that earnings will be somewhat more weighted towards the second half.","Relative to our last call in early May, we've incorporated foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of June 30, resulting in a reduction of about $0.01. Also, we've included the additional $0.06 impact from hydrology I touched on earlier. On the positive side, we've had some favorability on our full year tax rate, which we now expect to be roughly 24% compared to our prior assumption of 27%. This improvement added $0.05 for the year.","Finally, as Andres mentioned, we accelerated our cost cutting, refinanced recourse debt at lower rates, repurchased some shares. Together, these actions added $0.02 for the year compared to our prior guidance.","You may remember that we provided some PTC modeling assumptions for SBUs with our prior guidance. We generally don't expect to update these ranges on a quarterly basis. That said, our SBUs are generally still in those ranges, though some are at the lower end, primarily as a result of hydrology and lower power demand growth in Brazil. As a result, we've narrowed our range for total PTC by reducing the top end, which brings the midpoint down by $50 million. Again, we've offset the unfavorable PTC impact of the SBUs with favorability on tax and accelerated cost management.","Finally, turning to Slide 18, our capital allocation plan for the year. Since last quarter, our equity proceeds and asset sales have increased by nearly $60 million as a result of the Trinidad and wind turbine asset sales that Andres discussed. We expect to be in the higher end of our $400 million to $500 million range for parent free cash flow, which, as you know, is an important driver of our dividend policy. Therefore, based upon announced transactions, we're projecting discretionary cash of roughly $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.","Turning to uses. As Andres mentioned, we refinanced $750 million of parent debt and prepaid another $300 million. Including the premiums, we used $464 million of parent cash to complete these transactions. In addition, we refinanced our $800 million revolver, extending its maturity to June 2018 and reducing the margin by 75 basis points.","Also, we repurchased 5.3 million shares for a total investment of $63 million. Our current forecast includes $195 million for investment in our subsidiaries, and year-to-date, we've invested $87 million. This leaves discretionary cash to be allocated approximately $100 million to $250 million for the year. I'd like to highlight that it only includes asset sales proceeds received to date. We expect this to increase based on additional transactions in the pipeline. We continue to use our discretionary cash as a tool to maximize value for our shareholders.","Last quarter, we talked about using up to $200 million of our discretionary cash to fund the equity requirements for platform expansions at Gener. Since then, we've explored other funding alternatives for these investments. As we see it today, our participation in a potential equity issuance at Gener and Chile should be no more than $100 million. We'll keep you updated as our plans progress.","In summary, we're on track for the year, and our continued execution of our strategy will help us deliver on our commitments to shareholders.","Now back to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Tom. Operator, we'll now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jon Cohen from the ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So a couple of things. First of all, there's been some reports in the press about you looking to exit your stake in Cameroon. So now, I'm sure you don't want to talk too much about it, but can you give us a sense of just some of the high-level financial metrics there, maybe like book value and contribution at PTC?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, of course, I can't comment and I haven't. A lot of our -- none of our possible asset sales, we sort of laid out how we look at businesses and how we sell them. I would say that the -- that is within the EMEA region, and it's a relatively modest contributor to earnings and a very small contributor to our parent operating cash flow or dividends back to corp.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my other question, so it looks like you're at $500 million for proportional free cash flow for the year, which is almost half of the top end of your range. And you said that most of your earnings and cash flow from ops are going to be back-end loaded. So can we infer from that, that you'll do -- you could do better than the top end of the range for your proportional free cash flow, and what would that mean to the parent free cash flow?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, I would say that the parent free cash -- I mean, no, we're not going to -- as we're saying, we're staying within our guidance at this point. But as Tom indicated, we were doing better on the cash metric.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes. I think, Jon, I said it's the proportional free cash flow. I think I'd say that proportional free cash flow, we just stay with the ranges we have. I think the parent free cash flow, we're actually more conservative with that range going out at the start of the year, so we're now focused towards the top end of that range. And as we consider dividend policy later in the year, that's an important baseline.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, can you just give us a sense of what the rate -- long-term effective tax rate is? So it looks like this year, your earnings are going to benefit about $0.11 versus last year from tax. Is that something that should reverse over time? Or can we assume that your tax rate is going to stay close to where it was [indiscernible]?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","What we have in our long-term projections is low 30s. And so -- yes, this year in particular. This is very much effective from where the earnings come. So the earnings, for example, Brazil is having lower earnings, that is a high tax jurisdiction. If you have more earnings, for example, coming from Chile, that's a low tax jurisdiction.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes. So I think, Jon, you're right. I think as we look at sort of a run rate cutting through the differences, if next year is a normalized year on a similar path of earnings, we'd be about $0.10 to $0.12 higher in taxes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Andres, listening to your comments, particularly on the cost reduction front, the fact that you will be running ahead of plan this year, how should we think about the fact that, that $145 million target through '14 could end up being conservative? I mean, what's your confidence level that it will go up? And related to that, in the past, you've talked about the fact that even though you're officially looking at 4% to 6% EPS growth, your aspiration would be to get it back up to 6% to 8%. What's your confidence level on doing that, and when could we start to see signs of that happening?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay. I think in the first part of the question, how do we feel about our overhead cost reduction target. And first, I want to say, this is our overhead cost reduction targets. We're doing a lot of other things in the businesses. So first, yes, we feel confident that we will exceed the $145 million. We'll give you more exact indication how far we think that will go when we update our guidance for next year, in the fourth quarter, after we've finished our budget. And regarding the second question, as we said, we'll work very hard to exceed the sort of total return, as we set out at 6% to 8%. But we are facing significant headwinds. The dry hydrology this year is, in many cases, the worst the country's experienced in 70 years. And what's been very unusual is that the north of Latin America and the south of Latin America were correlated, which is usually they're not correlated, they're going opposite directions. As well as FX and commodities, but we remain committed to try to exceed this goal.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Second question. I know you guys had looked at this, potentially IPO-ing your solar assets in Toronto, pulled back on that. Since then, there's been excitement about this so-called yield cost structure. Other companies have tried it, and that seems to have been accepted well by investors. What would be your appetite for a structure like that? And what's your thinking on your portfolio in a yield-curve-type format?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, what we think -- again, the process that we're in now of bringing in partners on our projects and our businesses, especially financial partners, we're allowed to operate and really extract the synergies and economies of scale is the way to go. Now regarding the solar, we did look at a yield base, in sort of a yield curve on solar. We still have Mount Signal in construction, which is 260 megawatts of solar in Imperial Valley in California. And so, really, it was not completed. We weren't happy with the price and wait until there's less sort of construction risk and revisit this. So what I can say is that we're looking at all possible ways of getting the most value out of our footprint and out of our assets. That's really what we think it's all about. This is a capital-intensive business. And what we want to do is at each -- we have an unmatched footprint. We have a very good brand names, we have very good contracts, very good assets, it's really how can we maximize the returns from that invested capital. I don't know, Tom, do you want to add something?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","No, I think you said it well, Andres. I'd say we do look at ways that we can attract capital at more attractive levels. We certainly do at the project level with partnerships that Andres has touched on. We did look at the solar situation in the North and thought it was a good concept, we just weren't comfortable with the value. It may look better in the future once Mount Signal gets online. But...","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last question. Just to be clear on the asset sale goals you've talked about, so you've done about $234 million year-to-date. Did I hear you right that you still expect to do $500 million by the end of this year? And then the $900 million number you've talked about, is that incremental to the $500 million? Or does that incorporate the remaining portion of that $500 million?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Sort of the 2 parts of the question. First, yes, we remain optimistic that we can reach the $500 million in net proceeds to AES this year. And when you talk about the $900 million -- when I talk about the $900 million, that's up and above the $230 million that has already been closed this year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the starting point is after what has been done so far this year?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","That's correct. And if you remember, when we first started talking about it, we always said there was a universe around $2 billion. And what we're saying at this stage is that we feel confident that we can reach that -- from now to the next 2 years, complete this and hit the $2 billion figure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So quick first question here on the Gener funding of the equity layer, I suppose, later this year, is that really due to the Alto Maipo sale, and just kind of keeping your stake at a comparable level as it is today?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","No, Julien. It's Tom. It's really more -- Alto Maipo is on track. The partnership is very consistent with our expectations and what we've worked on for the last 6 months. It's really how Gener fund their equity piece into Alto. And we're looking at some scenarios that would have some non-equity which could reduce the Gener new issue common into the market.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Ultimately, would you keep the existing stake that you have in Gener with the $100 million?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, that's our expectation. So when you said up to $100 million, that would be roughly 70% of the deal, so that would assume that Gener would do an equity deal of $150 million, $175 million, something like that. Appreciate it's still work in process, but it also impacts how we see relative values. And so even if Gener went a little larger than we can subscribe to up to 70%, we can also dial it back if we want.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. And I'd like to add there, the way we're looking at the portfolio is that we really target even in the sense that through something like this, emission of shares at Gener, we can target the exact amount that we want and so -- also buy some of the sell-downs, so we'll be doing partial sell-downs. So what we're doing is really optimizing our portfolio and seeing where we get the -- we feel the best returns. Of course, it's a strategic objective of controlling these companies so that we can really extract the synergies from having this global portfolio.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, excellent. So perhaps the next question, just going back to the discussion on asset sales and partnerships. Just if you can provide some sense of magnitude for what these potential partnerships could yield in any kind of metrics, if you will, but just a little bit more detail there.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, that's a little bit tough. And as you know...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Do you have a target maybe or anything like that, that you want to throw out there?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","What I would say, in the number I gave you, the $900 million, some of that could be partial sell-downs than the $200 million that we are -- or $900 million that we're going to do over the next 2 years. So part of that could be partial sell-downs, and we could sell down at various levels. And again, the basic idea is to be able to tailor the risks that we want in markets that we want in technologies. So for example, take something like Alto Maipo, we want half of that project, because that's what we feel would be optimal for Gener and for us. And the same thing is the decision between Cochrane and Alto Maipo is to be able to do both projects. So as Tom mentioned, we will look at what's the optimal mix of partnerships and new equity, for example, into Gener.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then lastly on Bulgaria, I mean, you talked about preserving the contract value. And I know it's a little tough to talk about it right now, but what are those potential avenues, if you can talk about it at all, frankly.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Just to give you a sort of -- we have a great asset there. It's the only major plant in Bulgaria which is EU 16 compliant, very good contract. There's some things going on in Bulgaria, we're on top of that. I think Andy can comment a little bit more on the specific actions.","Andrew Martin Vesley","Julien, it's Andy Vesley. I really don't want to talk about all kind of options because quite honestly, our discussions associated with...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Andy, I'm not sure we can quite hear you.","Andrew Martin Vesley","Sorry, Julien. It's Andy Vesley. In terms of what's going on in Bulgaria, as you know, what's driving all these issues are the perception of the high energy prices, and that's retail energy prices. And as you may be following, when the new government came in, they reduced distribution tariffs by 7%, and that was done by impacting the distribution companies' distribution value added. August 1, they've come out with a new regime, basically reducing energy prices again by 5%, and that is going to other generators and not those who have PPAs like AES. The real issue that we're focusing on the moment is with our offtake in NEK and their liquidity because the primary focus for us right now is making sure our accounts are current. So we're in constant discussions. We had very productive discussions. They are working very hard to find ways of continuing to meet their obligations to us. At the moment, that's where our discussions are. And it's a changing situation. The Bulgarian government has taken a lot of steps in the sector, a lot of focus on NEK and how it's structured. So at this point, it's our relationship with NEK, which is in front of us, and the most immediate issue is to make sure that they continue to meet their obligation in paying for the energy that we provide them. So that's where we are at the moment. And as this goes forward, we'd be happy to update.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then actually, just a quick one on Uruguaiana in Brazil, any update on re-contracting there?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","On Uruguaiana, in terms of the actual operations of the plant, we operated for 2 months, and we expect to probably get it back up in September. This has to do with the Brazilians, as you know, because of the drought, they have managed their reservoirs very well and have been requesting a lot more thermal into the system. Now some of that, of course, has been socialized across all the generators, including Japan, that's affected somewhat the results. But yes, we do expect to be operating it once again, probably in September.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And that would be on a go-forward basis, just from a modeling perspective? Would that be...","Andrew Martin Vesley","Well, we're not ready to say that yet. I mean, the real issue becomes -- right now, in Brazil, as you know, they're still using a lot of thermal generation. So the ability to have Uruguaiana available to provide supply to help rebuild the reservoir levels is essential. And actually, the Brazilian government had said that. The real issue becomes the relationship between Brazil and Argentina and getting the gas. As you remember, the last time when we restarted the plant, it was Brazilian gas transported through Argentina. So there are a few pieces that have to work. Those conversations are ongoing, they're active, and we're very hopeful that we will not only be able to get the plant back, as Andres said, in an emergency situation, whether this year, but as we resolve the YPF situation, we'll have a long-term commitment.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. That's good to clarify. I mean, when I say September, on the month of September, our goal is to have it long-term available, constantly available, and receive capacity payments, et cetera. And we do have very good relations with both governments, and we're in conversations and we're optimistic this will happen.","Operator","Our next question will come from Charles Fishman from Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on that last -- or one of the previous questions on Bulgaria. What is your total exposure right now to NEK?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Our total exposure is about, let's say, 5% of our total PTC, pretax contribution. And I would say that our exposure, as you can see in the Q, is about $80 million in terms of, let's say, accounts receivable that are past due. But I'd say that that's basically -- on book value, I think it's somewhere around 590...","Andrew Martin Vesley","But we focused on the PTC number, so a little over 100, 110, something like that.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. But just to put it in context, as Andy said, I mean, right now, our focus is really on making sure we maintain the receivables at this level. The plant is operating very well, and the issues that the sector is facing in Bulgaria have a lot -- really are driven by this. It has to do with some of the legacy plants, increasing their exports of energy, and they've taken the right steps. So it's a question of strengthening any case cash flow more than anything else.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You've had a contractual issue with the contract around that plant at one time. Is that still in arbitration?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","We didn't -- well, we basically did have an issue with a contractor on that. And I think Brian can comment on that.","Brian A. Miller","You're correct. It's still in arbitration, and the hearing is scheduled for later this year and the beginning of 2014.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just roughly, what's your exposure on that?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, I'd say, our exposure, I mean, basically, it's -- we have, let's say, the funds that were put up for, let's say, losses caused by the contractor, I think are about -- well, about EUR 90 million to EUR 100 million, and that we feel our exposure here is minimal in terms of -- if any. Because what happened is that we asked them to exit the construction site and we completed it ourselves with some assistance from some technical firms, and we did get it up to nameplate capacity. I don't know, Brian, you can -- want to comment any more on that?","Brian A. Miller","No, it's accurate. And obviously, it's in arbitration, so we need to be a little less talkative about the issue.","Operator","Next, we have Gregg Orrill from Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could touch on parent free cash flow and how you see that trending into 2014 and ongoing? I know you said you are looking at the top end of the higher part of your guidance for this year. And then within that, just a couple of drivers, I know you said the parent interest was on a run rate reduction of $50 million, and how that compares to your expectation, and whether you can increase those savings going forward. And then lastly, on the MCAC region, I think you had some spot sales there, just how that's tracking relative to your PTC ranges from the Analyst Day and going forward.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Gregg, let me hit -- try those. From a parent free cash flow, I think our range for this year, $400 million to $500 million, was conservative. And as I said, we're more comfortable with the higher end of the range. You may remember last year, the number was about $520 million, $525 million. I think $500 million is a generally good run rate for us. We haven't got a specific number for next year, in '15, but that's a generally good number, maybe $450 million to $500 million. As we look out longer term, with some new plants coming online, especially Mong Duong, which comes on later in '15, we do think '16 and thereafter, we'll have some good ability for us to grow off of that base, if you will. But certainly, as it impacts dividends, as we've talked, we think we can grow into a range and then grow the baseline on a longer-term basis. Andy, I don't know if you want to touch on the spot sales...","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Gregg, could you clarify the question? I didn't hear it very well, for Andy. The second part of the question regarding MCAC.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The second part of the question is related to just how you were trending relative to the PTC guidance on MCAC and how you see that business going forward.","Andrew Martin Vesley","Yes. Gregg, maybe I'll just say that I think MCAC was still in the range, trending towards the lower part of that -- some meaningful offsets from Panama where we have said had some improved results out of the Dominican Republic. So it's still -- we're still below the midpoint in MCAC, but the DR is done well and I think benefited from some market conditions there.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then on interest expense going forward, additional savings and how it's coming in versus expectations?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, I think we will have some -- the interest savings that we're seeing this year, we'll have some continuation of that. I think it's in the 30-ish range, maybe $0.03 to $0.04, Gregg, from a bottom line EPS impact.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Chin from Merrill Lynch..","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Could you give us a little bit of update on Indianapolis Power & Light? Two things, one, I know that the CCGT decision is still early 2014, but any sort of color on updates on that? And then secondly, could you give us an update on the environmental retrofit settlement agreement, did the commission decide on that, what's the latest on that?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay. I think Andy can certainly can update you on the first part.","Andrew Martin Vesley","Yes. Brian, it's Andy Vesley. In terms of the CCGT, where we are in the process is we do expect, as you know, we filed for the CPCN almost a year ago, and we do anticipate getting a decision out of the commission on it this month, and we expected it to be on the last agenda. It wasn't -- well, we do anticipate it being at the end of this month. We don't anticipate any difficulty, and we were not aware of any issues that will come up. So we believe we'll be moving forward with that as per our schedule and as we've discussed before. In terms of the second part of your question, maybe if we're talking about -- are we talking about the MATS investment?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Certainly, it's the MATS.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I was thinking of the retrofits and settlement agreement that had been reached between Indianapolis Power & Light and the consumer groups. I think I have in my notes here that a decision by the commission was expected some time around the middle of this year, but maybe I've got my notes wrong. I just wanted to [indiscernible] right update.","Andrew Martin Vesley","Yes. Brian, I'm going to have to say that I'm aware of those ongoing discussions. I know that there had been a lot of proposal put back and forth. I am not aware that we have a decision, so we'll have to update you because I don't have any new information on that.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Okay, fair enough. And then second topic, I believe you said in the prepared remarks that the share buyback that's been done so far leaves about 237 million left that's been authorized. Is that correct?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","That's correct.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Based on the run rate of how much you guys have been buying back in terms of shares, that leaves about another year or so of share buybacks, if you just use the same run rate. Should we expect to see at some point over the next, call it, 2 or 3 quarters, an increase to the authorization amount, just to give you guys the flexibility in the event that shares do decline?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. As I've always said, the authorizations are really no issue in terms of us getting authorizations. The question is, as we make our capital allocation plans as we decide to do different things. So as I've said in the past, this is -- we have it. It's on the shelf. We can use it as we feel it is appropriate. If, for any reason, we wanted to exceed that amount, and of course, we could go back to the board and discuss it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Patterson from Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Most of my questions have been answered. But just back on comments you guys made on Bulgaria in terms of aiding any case, cash flow or liquidity, could you just elaborate a little bit more on that? I did notice that the receivables obviously rose and such. But what sort of -- how would you guys could be -- what has actually sort of contemplated with respect to that, if I understood that correctly?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, I think the most -- again these are decisions of the Bulgarian government, but there's certainly -- one of the things that NEK has faced is some relatively high export taxes, and just kind of lowering some of those export taxes to allow them to export more energy into the area and get more revenues from that. And also, it's a question of some of the legacy costs that they have from some of the less-efficient plants. I don't know, Andy, do you have anything to add really to that?","Andrew Martin Vesley","Yes. Paul, Andy Vesley here. The only thing I would say is that the liquidity issue in NEK is being worked by the government and the sector, and the new regime are looking for a lot of nonenergy cash visibility in NEK. Their laws have been changes in the taxes on energy. But let me put it into some perspective. I think our accounts are about $84 million, of which, 75% are less than 60-day aged. We've been in this situation with them before, and we've always been able to come to an arrangement. Without going to too much detail at the moment, we've received a letter from NEK basically with the proposal that would make them whole rather in the first quarter and a payment scheme. So everything seems productive there. And of course, it very much depends on a lot of this new regime coming into place, but the relationship we have, in any case, is very positive, it's very open. We meet with them regularly. We have solved this type of issue in the past, and we're trying to be as flexible as we can so we can have a long-term solution. They have an issue. Everybody's working on it. We want to be part of that solution. And given the past performance of NEK and our contacts with the government, we feel we're back on the path to having a resolution. And as that becomes firm, we'll be able to update everybody on it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. That's great. And then just on the 587 [ph] of net equity, that's the total exposure, is that right? There's no -- you guys don't have any parent guarantees or anything else with respect to the Maritza or whatever? Is that...","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes. No, that's correct. It's all nonrecourse financing.","Operator","No other questions are in queue at this time.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay. Well, thank you, operator. Before we conclude today's call, let me reiterate that we are reaffirming our guidance, that we continue to execute on our strategic plan, that we will continue to reduce cost and rationalize our portfolio. As we've previously laid out, we are maintaining a balanced approach to allocate capital towards deleveraging, returning cash to shareholders and investing in platform expansion to maximize risk-adjusted returns. We look forward to seeing you in the near future.","And with that, I will now turn the call back to Ahmed.","Ahmed Pasha","Thanks, Andres, and we thank everybody for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pasha, the floor is yours, sir.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, and welcome to AES\u2019 third quarter 2017 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, good morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2017 financial review call. Today, Tom and I will discuss our results for the quarter and year-to-date as well as our progress on our strategic and financial goals. We are reaffirming our prior guidance for 2017 and our expectations through 2020.","During the third quarter, we made significant progress on our construction projects and the integration of our renewable acquisitions. This morning, I will provide some color on the returns we expect to realize from these investments. I will also discuss our plans to accelerate and expand our asset sales program and cost-cutting and revenue-enhancement initiatives.","Before turning to these areas, I\u2019ll first discuss the impact of the recent hurricanes on our businesses in the Caribbean. Our sympathies are with the people of Puerto Rico, many of whom are still without power and water. Our number one priority before, during and after the recent hurricane was the safety of our people and their families and impacted communities.","Fortunately, our people and their families are safe, and our two plants in Puerto Rico sustained only minor damage. Both plants are currently available to meet their obligations under their PPAs. We expect the local transmission system to be energized and ready to take our much-needed power by the end of November. Tom will discuss the effects of the hurricanes in our financial results for the third quarter in more detail.","Today, we\u2019re announcing that we will be significantly upsizing our asset sales program. We now expect to realize $2 billion in proceeds during the 2018 to 2020 period. Approximately $1 billion of this is expected to occur by year-end 2018, including the sale of Masinloc, our coal plant in the Philippines. Interest remains very strong, and we expect to sign this sales agreement before year end and receive the proceeds early next year.","We\u2019re also announcing that we are aggressively pursuing significant additional cost savings. These G&A and O&M savings are likely to be earnings neutral in 2018 due to onetime restructuring costs, but accretive to 2019 and beyond. We will provide more detail on our fourth quarter call.","Turning to Slide 4 and our construction program, which is the key driver of our growth. Milestones were being met across our 5 gigawatts of projects under construction, including Alto Maipo in Chile. Although the Alto Maipo project has experienced construction delays and cost overruns, it is making progress towards overcoming these challenges.","First, the smaller of the two main contractors, CNM, was terminated. The Tunnel Boring Machine they had been operating is now being operated by Robbins, its manufacturer. They\u2019re progressing at a multiple of the historical rates achieved by CNM, and the Alto Maipo project is now 58% complete.","Second, Alto Maipo is in negotiations with various contractors for a fixed price, lump sum EPC contract. The new EPC contract would include substantial capital and performance commitments from the contractor, incentivizing timely completion. The restructuring would also require additional concessions from the project lenders and meaningful contributions from AES Gener, which would be tied to construction milestones.","The objective is to significantly reduce execution risks and preserve the value of Alto Maipo while, at the same time, remaining disciplined with additional equity from AES Gener. We will provide you with updates as Alto Maipo continues to make progress on these negotiations.","Turning now to the rest of our construction program, beginning on Slide 5. Our 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana is on track to achieve commercial operations in the first half of 2018. Construction is 99% complete, and the project is now in the commissioning phase. In fact, this past weekend, the project achieved a major milestone with the first fire of the turbine. The unit was synchronized to the grid and produced its first electricity.","Now turning to our 1.3 gigawatt Southland CCGT project on Slide 6, which is a repowering of our existing gas generation facilities in Southern California. Construction is ongoing, and the project is on track to be operational by the first half of 2020. Our remaining construction projects are proceeding as planned, including our thermal plant, OPGC 2 in India; and our CCGT and LNG regasification terminal, Col\u00f3n, in Panama. These projects will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth through 2020.","Turning to Slide 7. We have been reshaping our portfolio to reduce our carbon intensity and deliver attractive returns to our shareholders. To that end, our growth initiatives beyond the projects under construction have been focused on investments in natural gas and renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts in our existing markets.","On a portfolio basis, these investments are expected to produce average returns in the low teens. These compelling returns are driven by several factors, including investing in markets with lower renewable penetration and faster growth rates than the U.S.; using local debt capacity in the businesses to fund the investments; and using our business platforms and global scale to lower costs. Our project returns also benefit from bringing in partners to reduce our equity commitments while providing management and development fees.","I\u2019ll walk through some specific examples of how we have boosted returns on some of our recent investments, beginning on Slide 8. In July, we closed on our acquisition of sPower with the Alberta pension fund, AIMCo. We are encouraged by the quality of sPower\u2019s people, operating assets and development pipeline. In fact, we are well positioned to capitalize on sPower\u2019s 10-gigawatt-plus development pipeline by closing on at least 500 megawatts of solar projects annually in the U.S.","Additionally, we have received a number of inbound indications of interest to partner on a portion of sPower\u2019s operating assets. We\u2019re evaluating these proposals, which would increase our overall returns and allow us to redeploy the capital into sPower\u2019s attractive growth pipeline.","Turning to Slide 9. In Brazil, during the quarter, Tiet\u00ea moved forward on three growth transactions. Tiet\u00ea closed the acquisition of the 386-megawatt Alto Sert\u00e3o wind plant, finalized the acquisition of the 75-megawatt Boa Hora solar project and signed an agreement to acquire the 150-megawatt Bauru solar complex. The wind plant is currently operating with an 18-year contract, and all solar projects are expected to be operational in 2018 with 20-year regulated contracts.","The BRL1.6 billion of capital needed to fund these 611 megawatts of renewable expansions in Brazil has been secured by tapping into the available debt capacity at Tiet\u00ea without any equity. Returns on these long-term contracted assets are in the mid-teens in U.S. dollar terms.","Finally, turning to Slide 10. In Mexico, we\u2019re also seeing attractive returns for our development projects. With our partner, Grupo Bal, one of the largest business groups in Mexico, we have developed a strong 2.5-gigawatt pipeline of renewable and natural gas projects. We are targeting long-term bilateral contracts with creditworthy, large industrial off-takers. For example, we recently signed an agreement to acquire the 306 Mesa La Paz wind development project, which has a 25-year U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The project site also has sufficient additional land to accommodate up to 200 megawatts of solar, which could be an attractive upside in the future. We expect to reach financial close early next year and begin construction of Mesa La Paz shortly thereafter.","In summary, as you can see on Slide 11, we will be adding 8.4 gigawatts of new capacity by 2020. This includes almost 7 gigawatts of projects under construction or recently acquired. The remaining 1.5 gigawatts represent projects in advanced-stage development. As a result of these additions, our average remaining contract term will increase from 6 years currently to 10 years by 2020.","We have sufficient internally generated cash to fund our equity contributions for both our projects under construction and the development projects I just discussed. The projects we have under construction and the more recent investments we have made are helping us to significantly reshape our portfolio to achieve our financial objectives. At the same time, we're reducing our carbon intensity and deploying tomorrow's technologies.","As you can see on Slide 12, by the end of 2020, our coal generation will decline from 41% to 33%, while renewables and cash generation will increase from 55% to 63%. We've also been driving the adoption of energy storage in our markets as shown on Slide 13. We are a global leader in the industry with presence in seven markets, including 228 megawatts in operation and another 250 megawatts under contract or construction. In the Dominican Republic, we recently completed 20 megawatts of new energy storage. In September, these facilities performed flawlessly, working twice as much as normal to ensure the electric grid stayed online during Hurricanes Irma and Maria.","We believe the integration of energy storage and renewables is key to accelerating a cleaner energy future. This is one of the most promising opportunities in our industry, and our businesses are leading the way. For example, in Hawaii, we're helping the island of Kauai reduce their reliance on diesel generators by delivering a 28-megawatt solar farm and a 20-megawatt, five-hour duration energy storage.","Integrating energy storage to enhance the output of solar and wind facilities is a key focus area for Fluence, our new energy storage joint venture with Siemens. The Fluence JV received anti-trust approval from the European Commission in October and is expected to close by the end of this year. Once closed, we expect Fluence to deliver energy storage solution and services to a broader group of customers, from commercial and industrial companies to utilities and power developers in 160 countries. Together with Siemens, our goal is for Fluence to be the market leader in this high-growth segment that is expected to grow tenfold in five years, reaching at least 28 gigawatts of installed capacity by 2022.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our third quarter results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail.","Tom O'Flynn","Thanks, Andr\u00e9s. Good morning. Today, I'll review our third quarter results, capital allocation and guidance. Overall, our results were lower than the prior year for the quarter largely due to a higher intra-year tax rate and the impact of recent hurricanes. However, based on our year-to-date performance and outlook, we remain on track to deliver on our 2017 guidance and expectations through 2020.","Before moving on, I want to provide a brief update on the hurricanes on Slide 16. As we disclosed in October, the estimated impact from hurricanes in 2017 is $0.03 to $0.05 a share. We recognized $0.02 in the third quarter, mostly related to reserves taken at our corporate captive insurance business for estimated property damage in our solar plants in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. To a lesser degree, it also reflects a loss of operations at our thermal plant in Puerto Rico, which was down for 11 days in September.","Our business in the Dominican Republic was not affected. Since mid-October, the Puerto Rico plant has been available to meet its obligations under its Power Purchase Agreement. The plant can resume delivering much-needed energy to the grid as soon as the local transmission lines are repaired.","On that front, we're pleased with the resources and attention federal and local officials are allocating to restore the power grid, which is a top priority. Repair work is underway, and we're seeing real progress. Momentum should continue to build as EEI in various U.S. utilities have begun to assist in PREPA's restoration efforts. We expect the majority of the grid to be operational by the end of the year. When the plant is reconnected to the grid, we expect it to be dispatched since it's the lowest cost producer of energy, highly reliable and its location is critical to maintaining grid stability.","Now turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 17. Third quarter results were $0.24, an $0.08 decrease from 2016. For the year-to-date, adjusted EPS was $0.66, $0.02 higher than 2016. The quarterly results reflect a $0.05 impact due to a higher quarterly tax rate of 35% versus 23% the prior year. We expect a lower rate in the fourth quarter, bringing our average annual rate in its expected 31% to 33% range. Third quarter also reflects the $0.02 hurricane impact and lower margin at Andes, offset by positive results in the remaining SBUs.","Now to Slide 18 and our adjusted PTC and consolidated free cash flow. We earned $245 million in adjusted PTC in the quarter, a decrease of $27 million, due in part by the impact of the hurricanes. We generated $601 million of consolidated free cash flow, a decrease of $64 million from third quarter 2016, as higher working capital requirements in Brazil, U.S. and MCAC offset higher consolidated margins.","Now I'll cover our SBUs in more detail in the next six slides, beginning on 19. The U.S. margins were down slightly, largely due to moderate weather at IPL. Adjusted PTC increased primarily due to equity earnings from sPower, following the acquisition in July. Lower consolidated free cash flow also reflects higher working capital requirements at DPL and IPL.","In Andes, our results reflect lower margins primarily due to planned major maintenance and the impact of green taxes at AES Gener in Chile. This decline was partially offset by positive contributions from Cochrane Unit 2, which achieved commercial operations in October 2016. Adjusted PTC was also impacted by modest write-offs in Argentina and Chile.","In Brazil, margins increased due to lower fixed costs, higher tariffs and the recovery of prior tax payments at our distribution business, Eletropaulo. The increase in consolidated free cash flow reflects higher margins, partially offset by higher working capital requirements in Eletropaulo due to recovery of high purchase power costs in 2016 from prior droughts.","Before continuing with the quarterly results, I'll provide an update on our efforts to simplify Eletropaulo's ownership structure. As you may know, we own only 17% of this business. However, we are the controlling shareholder and, therefore, consolidate the full financials. We've now received all third-party approvals to migrate to Novo Mercado on the Brazilian stock exchange. As a result, we will no longer have a controlling interest and expect to deconsolidate the business in the fourth quarter. This will simplify our financial statements and also provide greater flexibility.","In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect higher margins driven primarily by higher availability and higher contracted sales in the Dominican Republic, following the completion of the DPP project this year. Hurricanes were not a major driver for the quarter in MCAC as most of the $0.02 impact I mentioned earlier was incurred in our captive insurance business at corp. Consolidated free cash flow is flat as higher margins were offset by the timing impact of lower collections in the Dominican Republic. That said, outstanding receivables were settled in full in October.","Finally, in Eurasia, our results were largely driven by higher energy and capacity margins at Ballylumford in the UK.","Now on Slide 24 and the resolution of our filing at DP&L in Ohio. As you may know, on October 20, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ruled at our ESP case. The order was consistent with the March Stipulation agreement with only minor modifications. As expected, the ESP includes a Distribution Modernization Rider totaling $105 million per year over three years with a two-year extension option. As previously announced, DPL is selling or exiting all of its 2.1 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by mid-2018.","DPL is also running sales process for the remaining one gigawatt of gas-fired peaking capacity and expects to announce the transaction by year end, with closing expected in the first half of 2018. The commission's ruling in the exit of merchant generation are important steps that will enable DPL to transition to an investment-grade growing T&D business. In fact, you see significant potential to increase the regulated asset base through distribution infrastructure, smart grid and other grid modernization investments. We're pleased to see that these actions are being appreciated by the rating agencies, including a 2-notch upgrade of the DPL family to BB from Fitch earlier this week.","Now to Slide 25 and our improving credit profile. This year, we\u2019ve prepaid $300 million of parent debt and refinanced another $1 billion with long-term debt at attractive rates, resulting in annualized interest savings of $40 million. Excluding drawings on our revolver, this brings our total parent debt to $4.5 billion. This represents a $2.1 billion or about a one-third reduction in parent debt since 2011. Through disciplined debt reduction and strong growth in parent free cash flow, we expect to attain investment-grade credit metrics by 2020. We believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve financial flexibility but also enhance our equity valuation.","Now to our 2017 parent capital allocation on Slide 26. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.4 billion of total available discretionary cash, including parent free cash flow. We expect to be comfortably in the middle of our range of $575 million to $675 million. In addition to the $300 million we received from the sale of Sul in Brazil, we have closed another $80 million of sales, including $60 million from the sell-down of our business in the Dominican Republic.","In September, one of our existing partners acquired an additional 5% of the business, implying a total equity value of $1.25 billion. Total asset sale proceeds for the year are about $400 million left than we had shown previously due to a timing difference as we expect to receive those proceeds in early 2018. We plan to use our revolver to fund the temporary shortfall and repay the drawings in early 2018.","Moving to uses on the right-hand side. Including the dividend increase we announced last December, we\u2019ll be returning almost $320 million to shareholders this year. We used $340 million to prepay and refinance parent debt, as I just discussed. Finally, we used $382 million for our acquisition of sPower and plan to invest $350 million in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects under construction and a late-stage development.","Now looking at our capital allocation from 2018 through 2020 on Slide 27. We expect our portfolio to generate $3.3 billion of discretionary cash, which includes parent free cash flow and asset sale proceeds. We have conservatively included half of our $2 billion asset sale target, reflecting the transactions we expect to close in 2018. In terms of uses, after funding our dividend and construction projects, we have $1.6 billion of capital to create additional shareholder value. Of this, we\u2019d expect to allocate about 40% to 45% to dividend growth and debt reduction and the remaining amount to invest in attractive growth opportunities.","Finally, turning to Slide 28. We are reaffirming our prior 2017 guidance and expectation for an 8% to 10% average annual growth through 2020 for all metrics. As you know, we pointed to the lower half of our guidance range for adjusted EPS in October, following the hurricanes. We still expect a higher rate of EPS growth in 2018 in the low to mid-teens, off the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. This will be largely driven by contributions from new projects, cost-savings and revenue-enhancement initiatives in lower parent interest.","To give a little bit more color by SBU, we expect growth in the U.S. to be driven largely by positive regulatory developments at DPL as well as growth in renewables. Andes will benefit from continued market reforms in Argentina, higher contracting levels at Angamos and higher generation in Colombia. Growth in MCAC is expected to be driven largely by completed construction projects, including a full year of operations to the DPP combined cycle in the Dominican Republic as well as a partial-year impact from the commencement of operations at the Col\u00f3n CCGT in Panama. Growth will be partially offset by business exits in the Philippines and Kazakhstan.","Finally, we expect a benefit from our cost savings and revenue-enhancement initiatives as well as lower parent interest. Consistent with our prior practice, we\u2019ll be providing more detail and specific guidance for 2018 on our year-end call in February.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Tom. In summary, we\u2019re taking a lot of actions at AES to deliver on our strategy and commitments to shareholders. Our sector is undergoing significant change, and we\u2019re undertaking a further transformation of our business to take advantage of new opportunities. Specifically, we\u2019re accelerating and increasing our asset sales program to achieve $1 billion in proceeds by end 2018 and a total of $2 billion by 2020. We\u2019re on track to achieve our target $400 million in annual cost savings and revenue enhancements, and we\u2019re aggressively pursuing additional savings that we will announce on our fourth quarter call.","We\u2019re advancing on our 5 gigawatts of construction projects and are aiming to resolve the issues at Alto Maipo in the first quarter of 2018. We are pleased with our acquisition of sPower and see many attractive renewable opportunities across our portfolio. We expect Fluence to close this year, and our goal is to maintain our global leadership in a market that is projected to grow tenfold over the next five years.","These actions will result in a simpler portfolio, earning higher risk-adjusted returns and a stronger balance sheet with improved credit metrics. Our overriding objective is to generate 8% to 10% average annual growth in earnings and free cash flow. When combined with our dividend, we expect to deliver a total shareholder return of at least 12% annually.","Now we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Hi, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. First question, with regards to the 2018 guidance, earlier in the year, Tom and Andr\u00e9s, when you had talked about 2018, you had told us, net-net, it\u2019s about $0.20 higher than 2017. [Indiscernible] somewhere $1.25 range. But now you\u2019re telling us low to mid-teens, which implies a lower implied number for 2018. So what has changed for 2018?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yes. Good morning, Ali. It\u2019s Tom. I mean, yes, if you cut through the dis from the percentage increase, it\u2019s part of our $0.05. I mean, first I\u2019d say that we\u2019re still in the final stages of our budget process, and we\u2019ll come up with firm numbers in Feb. We just want to give people a general ballpark. There\u2019s nothing major. I\u2019d say, there\u2019s \u2013 perhaps, there\u2019s a couple of cents in the U.S. DPLs may be a little softer from the regulatory outcome and some plant closure numbers. And the rest is kind of a $0.01 here and a $0.01 there. But we\u2019re still grinding through it.","Ali Agha","Okay. So I mean, could you get back to that $0.20 delta? Or do you think that\u2019s a bit unrealistic here?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","I mean, I think that\u2019s certainly \u2013 we certainly always look for things to do more of. Andr\u00e9s talked about really doing a very heavy look at costs across the company that we\u2019re in the process of. So we certainly look for that. But that said, I think we want to give people a general expectation of where things were trending to. And so we\u2019d probably be closer to $0.05 below. So it\u2019s still a fair amount above 2017.","Ali Agha","Right, right. Second question, with regards to the asset sales, I just wanted to be clear. So previously, we had thought there would be a $500 million sale this year, which, I think you\u2019ve confirmed, will be Masinloc. But now what you\u2019re telling us is that probably still gets announced by year end, but you get the proceeds next year. Did I hear that right?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yes. And just to be clear, earlier on in the year, we put a placeholder in for $500 million. There were different things that we were considering. It\u2019s not clear that we can do $1 billion, that Masinloc will be \u2013 can do $1 billion and close that $1 billion by the end of 2018 and that the Masinloc process is quite deep in the process. We got very heavy interest. So yes, specifically with Masinloc, we expect to announce Q4 in the next, what, six weeks, and we expect to close it in the first half of 2018. But that $500 million was done before we had thought about a specific candidate. We think that Masinloc will be well in excess of that.","Ali Agha","Yes. And broadly speaking, when you look at the $2 billion number, I mean, is the motivation to essentially exit non-core markets, can you give some sense of [indiscernible]","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, Ali, well, when we started, we were in 28 countries. When we exit the Philippines, we\u2019ll be in 15. We\u2019ve always said that somewhere between 12 to 15 countries is kind of our probably we thought that where we would end up. So I think it\u2019s looking more like a dozen. And of course, we never announce anything before the sale is actually done. So some of it will be exiting some countries, and some of it will be selling down from certain assets.","And in some cases, may be selling down a portion of the assets. For example, as we did recently in the Dominican Republic, to realize value. I think the important thing is that where we want to end up and what does that portfolio look like. And as we said, it will be simpler. It will be in less countries. It will be less carbon-intensive. And we will be, if you will, sort of turning capital into growth areas where we get higher returns and then sitting on some existing assets.","Ali Agha","Okay. Last question, Andr\u00e9s, if I could. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve been keeping an eye on what\u2019s been happening in the IPP merchant power space. Companies have basically concluded that the public markets are not giving them credit for their portfolios. Many are going private. They\u2019ve been sold. Major restructurings happening. Are there any lessons learned for AES given how your stock gets valued in the public markets today?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I will say \u2013 well, I think the lessons \u2013 I mean, we moved to get out of merchant generation, I think, on a timely basis. I think we\u2019ve exited a number of markets that since I\u2019ve been troubled on a timely basis, and I think we\u2019ve generally sold our assets at very good prices. So we didn\u2019t do really any sort of fire sales. We waited in some cases until the contracts ran out.","Now if you look at our strategy, we\u2019re moving into much more contract, and we\u2019re lengthening our average contract versus what we have even today. So I think we have a quite different strategy from most. I think we\u2019re changing our risk profile. We\u2019ve significantly derisked. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll notice that on this call, we did not talk about the weather in Brazil. That used to be the main focus of these calls, quite frankly. And we have been able to derisk from the way we\u2019ve contracted. I think, as Tom mentioned, when we deconsolidate Eletropaulo, it will make a better correlation between really our economic, our financial profile and our consolidated profile.","And lastly, we\u2019re moving aggressively to become investment-grade. So I think on all these fronts, I think our strategy has been considerably different from other firms, which have remained less contracted and also, quite frankly, which aren\u2019t moving into the newer technologies. So I think we have the advantage of being in more rapidly growth markets and being well-positioned.","Having said that, ever since I\u2019ve been CEO and Tom\u2019s been CFO, I mean, we have looked at all alternatives, and we periodically have third parties come in and look and say is there any way we can sustainably add value to the company? So we\u2019re always open to these any ideas, but we\u2019re only going to do things which makes sense for the company in terms of a sustainable company.","So we\u2019re open to all alternatives. I\u2019ve seen the \u2013 some of these. And obviously, in the sector, there\u2019s been a lot of consolidation to take out costs, but we\u2019ve taken a lot of costs. And we\u2019re also, as we\u2019ve said on this call, going to be aggressively looking at our cost structure. This is partly the result, I\u2019d say, of the actions we\u2019ve taken, the systems we\u2019ve put in place and also the simplification of our portfolio.","Ali Agha","Thank you, Andr\u00e9s.","Operator","The next question we have will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So maybe let me follow up a little bit on the asset sale strategic positioning here. Can you talk about how you think about the \u2013 let\u2019s not talk about the IPP peers but the YieldCos and just the overall market subsector there. How do you think about yourself relative to that sector? And how do you think about desirability that you recycle capital in that direction, i.e., I hear you guys talk about more asset sales. I hear you expanding your renewable platform as it stands today. Can you provide any further thoughts just putting all these pieces together?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes. That\u2019s a great question. When you remember, when YieldCo\u2019s first started, it was a lot of, I\u2019d say, questions we were getting from various people like, why don\u2019t you do a YieldCo? And one of our concerns was not to have a \u2013 to be sort of committed to growth in case markets turned. And I think, in general, that has been the, right now, the right decision.","Now if you look at what we\u2019re doing today, we did mention, for example, that on sPower, we are looking at selling down a portion of the operating assets to enhance our returns and be able to move that money into new projects, the 10-gigawatt-plus pipeline where we think we can improve our average return. So in that sense, we, I think, have shown that we can access private money. We\u2019ve raised about $3.8 billion over the last six years of partner equity, including \u2013 from the large Canadian pension funds.","So in that sense, I think that our view is that we are very interested in coming up with ownership structures, which are win-wins, where we provide for people looking for long-term, stable, investment-grade assets. And at the same time, it allows us to reduce our participation and improve our returns be it through management fees or promote \u2013 or development fees.","So that is part of the market. Now I think where we\u2019re somewhat different is that we see the advantage of having a platform in these countries. So for example, having a strong partner in Mexico opens a lot of opportunities for us in renewables. Having a strong position in various markets opens that up. So we want to use our scale and in cases, integrate the new renewables with our existing assets because, obviously, energy prices from renewables, in many cases, are lower.","But if you can integrate that with the capacity from existing assets, you can have some very interesting propositions for your customers. In the longer term, we think batteries can supply that in many markets. But right now, we see that opportunity. So to answer your question, we have approached the problem from a sort of customer-centric position. We\u2019re taking advantage of our platforms, and we\u2019re bringing in capital and selling down when we see the opportunity that, that would improve our returns.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Now just in thinking through committing to any kind of structure, would you be open to investing in a third-party structure to establish an independent acquisition vehicle? And if so, to \u2013 how would you think about establishing that just given the discrepancies in multiples and the perceived accretion or dilution involved just at the outset?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think, again, if you think of something like sPower, we have a partnership with them. sPower, as we\u2019ve said in the past regarding acquisitions, we would look opportunistically at that. If we think that there are acquisitions where we have significant synergies, it\u2019s 2 plus 2 equals 6, add to that portfolio. On the other hand, we\u2019re not looking right now at sort of big acquisitions, et cetera. We\u2019re sort of looking at asset acquisitions that could enhance that portfolio. And as I said, if there are interested parties in taking a portion of that from the sPower JV, that\u2019s fine as well.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. All right. Excellent. I\u2019ll leave that there. Can I move a little bit further down to the Gener level? Just curious, in light of the developments on the Alto Maipo side, how are you viewing cash distributions back to the parent right now? Obviously, things are somewhat fluid there vis-\u00e0-vis finalizing up the EPC, et cetera. I suppose plan \u2013 you\u2019re moving ahead with plan, and you don\u2019t necessarily anticipate any limitations in terms of distributions given any credit concerns that, that\u2019s up.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think this is a \u2013 the negotiations in Alto Maipo are proceeding. The Alto Maipo team and Gener team are doing a great job. I would say that Gener will remain an investment-grade company, that any equity contributions from Gener to the Alto Maipo project would maintain that investment grade, will be very \u2013 looking at the sort of marginal returns of that investment. And we don't expect it to significantly affect any dividend distributions from Gener into the future. So those are the things. Now we've also said that should we decide not to proceed with the project, that would also, in terms of the cash distributions from Gener, those would continue, although they might take a different form in terms of like return of capital. So we're looking at both. We will be very disciplined. On the other hand, we think that there is a win-win solution here, which would be good for all parties, including, obviously, Chile and Chile electric system from completing the project.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And is there anything, just lastly, coming back to what Ali was talking about, reason why you're not including the full $2 billion in your pie chart there around use of cash? I imagine maybe it's just too early to anticipate what exactly and what form it takes or you tell me how specific you are in your asset sales at this point.","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, Julien, it's Tom. I'd say that traditionally, we put things up here when they're either announced or close to being announced. So I think we feel very comfortable that we've got a good line of sight on $1 billion. Execution is underway. Good comfort with being able to sign near-term close, certainly next year, if not in the first half of the year. So as we continue to think through more businesses, assets, et cetera, that make a win to that, then we would expand that piece accordingly.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just a quick...","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I mean, you know that when we first announced that we'd be doing asset sales, I believe we used a number of around $1 billion. I think we're at $4 billion now. We announced Cal's, as we've said, $100 million. We're at $200-million-plus now. So generally, we just want to be, as Tom was saying, have a real clear line of sight. Now obviously, we have a number of opportunities that would make sense from a strategic plan that I outlined that we think can easily get us to that $2 billion number by 2020.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just to be clear, in setting an expectation here, would you expect any of this to be EPS dilutive or accretive to the extent to which you kind of know which assets you're thinking about here against the plan?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes. I think it's a mixture. Certainly, some could be accretive, some that could be dilutive. I think if you look at the overall group, there is some modest dilution. I think we factored that into our overall growth rate. I think some of the incremental cost efficiencies we plan to put in place may give us the offsets to be able to transition the portfolio and also meet our numbers.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes. And what I'd say is we are \u2013 our overriding objective is to meet that 8% to 10% growth rate we've committed. So there will be puts and takes, like Tom said, but it won't affect us reaching our objectives.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And you guys didn't raise your cost target for the long term here, right? Obviously, there's some shifts, but.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, not specifically. We just \u2013 it's something we're evaluating, and we'll talk more about it on our year-end call in Feb.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Thank you for taking some of the questions. Appreciate it. Have a good day.","Operator","Next, we have Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI.","Greg Gordon","Hi, guys good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning.","Greg Gordon","So just want to make sure I heard you correctly in the response to Julian that the \u2013 you see the incremental cost cutting announcement as supplementing your ability to hit the 8% to 10%. You don't think you'll be in a position to move that range as a function of that, and that's partly because of the friction that might happen when you reposition the portfolio through these assets sales and redeploy that capital. Is that a fair summary?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","What I'd say as a summary, the additional cost cuts that we're working on and will announce in the fourth quarter will give us additional comfort of hitting that range. So this is \u2013 it's additional to what the cost cuts we've announced in the past. On the other hand, we're not changing that guidance range. It will give us additional comfort. Because as we \u2013 as Tom said, there's puts and takes, so we want to make sure that we hit our numbers.","Greg Gordon","Well, what are some of the takes that happened since you last gave the guidance that are \u2013 where these cost cuts are going to fill in there?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes. No. Greg, my comment on puts and takes is more on EPS impact from certain sales. Some are accretive, some are dilutive.","Greg Gordon","Got you. And I just wanted to make sure that was clear. The second question I have is, and I feel like it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu all over again with this, the stock is obviously down a lot. It's performing okay today. But if consensus expectations for your earnings are right, the return on buying back your stock is in excess of the return \u2013 average expected return on the investments you're making. There's no placeholder in your capital plan, whatsoever, for buybacks. Just I really am a little bit agitated by that, and I want to understand your thinking.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, we have done a considerable amount of buyback over the years, and we do have an outstanding approval. So we're not saying that we're \u2013 won't do buybacks. We're just not announcing any specific buybacks at this point in time. So obviously, we are not happy at all with where our stock is trading, and we always consider that. But I think that at this point, we're undergoing a transition program, and I think it will be very important that we deliver on our numbers. But certainly, we're not saying that we won't do stock buybacks.","Greg Gordon","Can you remind us what the outstanding authorization is for the buyback?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Currently, we have $250 million still remaining on our prior authorization.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Look, Andr\u00e9s, I look at the reinvestment you're making in the business and how you're repositioning it, and I think it's very attractive. So I'm not arguing that what you're doing to reposition the company is not well thought out and obviously you have a plethora of opportunities. The issues that the return on a buyback at these prices is like a mid- to high-teens ROE. And the return on the investments you're making, even though they're very attractive, is not as attractive as the stock. So I think you really need to consider being more aggressive with the market and show them that you have confidence you can hit your targets by buying back the stock when it's attractive.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Point taken, Greg. As I said, we've \u2013 today, we're returning through the dividend about 55% of our parent free cash flow. So I think we remain committed to giving money back to our shareholders, and we have done, I believe it's about $1.5 billion of stock buybacks, at least over the past five years. So I certainly don't want to say that this is off the table, and point taken.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions)] Next, we have Lasan Johong of Auvila Research.","Lasan Johong","Hi Andr\u00e9s, Thanks for taking my question. I just want to make a quick comment. I am very much opposed to share buybacks. It does not create value. It's a waste of money. You're shoving money out of your left pocket and putting in your right pocket. And other than signaling purposes, it's a waste of capital. Moving on, please. I'm assuming, since you're selling the Philippine, you're not doing Masinloc 2?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Masinloc 2 is under construction. The construction is going well, and that would be part of...","Lasan Johong","No, I understand that. But are you going to finish that construction? Or is that part of the sale of Masinloc?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski ","Well, we would finish the construction under our contract for the new seller.","Tom O'Flynn","So we'd expect the \u2013 it's Tom. Just to clarify, we'd expect the sale to close before the construction is complete. And it's \u2013 the construction is going very well. It's pretty clean. It's got an EPC, so it's not a material issue.","Lasan Johong","No, I understand that. But when you say you're selling Masinloc, are you're selling Masinloc 1 only? Or Masinloc 1 and the construction project?","Tom O'Flynn","No, 1 and 2. We're selling the business. We see this one...","Lasan Johong","Okay. Great. The \u2013 a couple of years ago, Argentina instituted an accounts receivable financing of new generation, and people were kind of skeptical. Can you give us a view as to whether it's working out or not working out in Argentina with that accounts receivable financing?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure. I\u2019d say, first to say that Argentina has really made a comeback. I think, starting from the top level as the \u2013 politically, as you know, they had a recently elections for Congress, and Macri\u2019s party got 40% of the vote, much more than people had expected. So the reforms are going forward in Argentina. In our sector, they\u2019ve made very important reforms: one is dollarizing; second is increasing moderately, prices \u2013 retail prices but also generation. And they will move towards a liberated market. People forget, but in the 1990s, Argentina had one of the best regulations on the planet in terms of liberated markets.","So Argentina is doing much, much better. Our business is doing much, much better. We had two years where we did not receive dividends from Argentina, even though the business has always made money. So it\u2019s obviously, we perceive much more dividends and making much more money. Getting to your point about this was the FONINVEMEM, one of the more difficult acronyms we have to pronounce. They have been paying the interest on the FONINVEMEM. These are actualized. Part of the bonds are tied to the completion of actual generation assets. In this case, it was the Guillermo Brown as being the largest one. So that plant is up and running. So that whole \u2013 and what I would put it was basically part that the CAMMESA would take part of your payments and essentially give you these bonds and use the funds to build a new asset. But they have paid interest. The plants have been completed, so that \u2013 that\u2019s going well.","Lasan Johong","Okay, great. I\u2019m a little confused about Fluence. The existing energy storage facility, is that part of \u2013 going to be \u2013 going forward, is it going to be part of Fluence? Or is that separate, and then Fluence will be a new stock with new projects?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes. What I\u2019d say is, look, we have about 228 megawatts of energy storage facilities on our platform. Those are not being sold. Those remain with AES because they\u2019re our assets. Fluence is a joint venture to develop and to sell our Advancion 4 product, and Advancion 5 that will be coming out, and Siemens\u2019 Siestorage product. So we both contributed a product to this. With the net result is that we\u2019re the only, let\u2019s say \u2013 Fluence is the only firm which can offer the full gamut from commercial and industrial small units to the largest utility scale, 100-plus megawatt energy storage. So we\u2019ve combined those two.","So we\u2019re moving R&D together. Fluence will be doing that. We will be taking advantage of Siemens\u2019 platform, and we\u2019ll be taking advantage of Siemens\u2019 sales force. Siemens is active in 160 countries. It\u2019s been selling electric equipment for more than 100 years, so it has a great brand name. So we think bringing these together is very, very powerful. And we really don\u2019t see anybody else like it in the market, at least today. So the point is this will be a separate company, a JV. It\u2019s 50-50. Siemens and us. We\u2019re both contributing people to that project. It will use Siemens\u2019 sales force. When we put energy storage on, say, our solar projects, that sPower, we\u2019re a client. So it\u2019s separating the two.","So we expect this to grow very quickly. As we say \u2013 have said in the past, we don\u2019t expect any cash or earnings contributions for, say, two more years during this rapid growth phase and thereafter. But we think it should be a very valuable company within a time period of five years. We\u2019ve done things like this before, just to remind people, in the case of Brazil, we had rights of way. We developed a broadband supplier. This is a company we sold for $1 billion to Telecom Italia a couple of years ago"," So we think this could grow very rapidly. But again, it\u2019s separate from us. We will continue to do energy storage. For example, on Southland, we have a contract with Southern California Edison for 100-megawatt facility. That will be ours under potentially a contract with Southern California Edison. That\u2019s not part of Fluence. It will buy the equipment from Fluence.","Lasan Johong","Got it. One last question. AES stock lag, if you leave the DOE report for August, they\u2019re pretty much suggesting that in a high renewables area, base-load plants are either going to be obsolete or they\u2019re going to have to get paid for things that are not currently being compensated for, such as Brazilian characteristics and reliability characteristics. Does that worry you that AES Southland is being built as a CCGT, not as a SCGT facility?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, because of the contract we have. I mean, I think that when you speak about it, it would \u2013 what I think is interesting is that with energy storage, we\u2019re seeing that regulations. And they have a lot of \u2013 they do a lot of things, which aren\u2019t translated in the current regulation. All over the world, what we\u2019re doing is, let\u2019s say, testing and actually, certifying some of our coal plants to run at lower MINs [ph] to give them greater flexibility to be ready for that future. But I don\u2019t know, Tom, do you want to add anything?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes. No, Andr\u00e9s said, I\u2019d just add that our California plant, the one that\u2019s under construction in Southland, has got very good flexibility. That\u2019s what the SoCal Ed was focused on. So it\u2019s got quick ramp capacity and low MINs, and it\u2019s also in a very critical location in the transmission infrastructure. Just, what is it, 30 miles south of L.A. So those are all things that I think we\u2019re taking into account in our proposal and SoCal Ed\u2019s request for bid now two years, two and a half years ago.","Just in terms of the overall DOE proposal, given that we\u2019re essentially getting out or will be out of the merchant generation business mid-next year, we don\u2019t see it as a major impact. I suppose we\u2019re closing a couple of coal plants down to the extent that another party looks and says that\u2019s an opportunity for them to step in, we\u2019re certainly open to those kinds of ideas.","Lasan Johong","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Well, at this time, we\u2019re showing no further questions. We\u2019ll go ahead and conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Ahmed Pasha for the closing remarks. Sir?","Ahmed Pasha","We thank everybody for joining us on today\u2019s call.

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Brandon. Good morning everyone and welcome to our first quarter 2019 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior management of our management team. With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter 2019 financial review call. Since our last call we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. We continue to transform the company, growing our renewables and LNG businesses, simplifying and streamlining our portfolio, reducing costs, and improving our overall risk profile. Specifically we reported first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.28 and remain confident in our full year outlook. ","We're on track to attain investment grade ratings in 2020. We signed long-term contracts for approximately 500 megawatts of renewable capacity increasing our backlog to 6.2 gigawatts. We signed a 12 year agreement to sell up to 18 TBTUs of LNG annually in the Caribbean beginning in 2020. Today we're announcing a target of $100 million of additional annual cost savings to be realized by 2022 as a result of our digital initiatives and we agreed to sell our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland for $211 million. Gustavo will discuss our financial results and capital allocation plan in more detail following my remarks. ","Turning to slide 4, our core strategy continues to revolve around three themes; first, enhancing the resilience of our portfolio to deliver attractive returns. Second, increasing our backlog long-term contracted projects to ensure profitable growth. And third, investing in innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market leading positions. Today I will review the progress we've made since our last call in support of these themes. ","Turning to slide 5, we continue to take steps to derisk our portfolio and make it even more resilient. We remain on track to attain investment grade ratings by 2020 supported not only by our financial metrics but also by the lower level of risk and higher quality of our portfolio. We expect to achieve our carbon intensity reduction target of 50% by 2022 and 70% by 2030 reducing potential regulatory risks and attracting a broader investor base. One of the ways we are reducing our carbon intensity is through our green blend and extend strategy where we are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing long-term thermal customers. Through this win-win strategy we preserve the value of our existing contracts while extending our average contract life and earning a return on our incremental capital investments. ","We're currently in advanced discussions for additional large green blend and extend contracts in Chile and Mexico. Separately we just initiated a similar conversations on green blend and extend with PURPA in Puerto Rico. Another way we're transforming our portfolio is by exiting certain businesses. For example in late April we announced the sale of more than 2 gigawatts of overwhelmingly thermal generation in Jordan and Northern Ireland. These sales decrease our merchant exposure, lower our carbon intensity, and reduce our presence to 13 countries. In line with our capital allocation framework we will primarily invest these proceeds in renewables in the Americas. ","Turning to slide 6, as we've discussed previously we're focused on growing our business through long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts with limited merchant commodity and hydrology exposure. One additional initiative that I would like to mention today is the expansion of our business with commercial and industrial customers. This approach further enhances our resilience by diversifying our customer base and providing greater protection from regulatory and macroeconomic factors in our markets. ","Now turning to our backlog, our growth in renewables continues. As can be seen on slide 7 during the first quarter we signed new long-term PPAs for approximately 500 megawatts of renewables consistent with our expectations. Turning to slide 8 we now have a total backlog of 6.2 gigawatts and we expect to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs every year for a total of approximately 12 gigawatts of new capacity by 2022. By then we project the U.S. will represent almost half of our earnings versus about a third today. ","Now to our projects under construction beginning on slide 9, of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction approximately 40% is now renewables. This percentage will grow as we bring online the large conventional thermal plants we contracted number of years ago while adding new wind, solar, and energy storage projects. As you can see on slide 10 the renewable projects under construction are split equally between the U.S. and internationally. All of these projects are expected to come online in the next 18 months. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we have been able to transition these projects from development to construction. For example as you can see on slide 11 we received all necessary permits for sPower's 500 megawatt Highlander Solar Project in Virginia, the largest solar project in the mid-Atlantic. This project has long-term contracts with C%I customers such as Apple and Microsoft and we expect to begin construction this summer with completion targeted for 2020 and 2021. ","Turning to slide 12 and our conventional projects under construction. Our OPGC 2 plant in India is in the testing phase and is running at full load. The plant is expected to be operational later this month and will deliver much needed power to the Indian grid. Our Southland Repowering project in Southern California is approximately 90% complete and the project is on track to come on line in the first half of next year. And our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned and is now 78% complete with 72% of the tunneling work done. ","Turning now to our LNG business on slide 13. You see the expansion of our LNG projects is complementary to our renewable businesses as it provides capacity while displacing heavy fuel oil and diesel with cheaper and cleaner natural gas. This business is based on long-term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk. Another benefit of our LNG projects is that once they are built they can be scaled up at relatively low cost as most of the key infrastructure is already in place. We are focusing our LNG growth on two major markets; first is Vietnam where we are making very good progress towards the development of a landmark project with 450 TBTUs of LNG storage capacity and 2 gigawatts of associated combined cycle gas plants. We expect this project to significantly contribute to our growth beginning in 2023. ","Second, in the Caribbean and Central America where we have a total of 150 TBTUs of LNG storage capacity in Panama and the Dominican Republic. Our guidance assume that we would contract some of the excess capacity available at these two terminals. In fact since our last call we signed a 12-year contract for up to 18 TBTUs of annual capacity. With this contract we have already locked in the terminal capacity payments that are assumed in our guidance through 2022. The remaining uncontracted capacity provides us with $0.03 of potential EPS upside relative to our guidance. ","Turning to slide 14, the third component of our core strategy is to invest in innovative technologies to maintain our market leading position and realize commercial and operational efficiencies. As most of you know AES is at the forefront of battery based energy storage. Fluence, our energy storage joint venture is the leading provider of grid scale storage in the world with 81 projects in 18 countries totaling 776 megawatts deployed or awarded. Now let me say a few words on the recent thermal incident at our 2 megawatt energy storage facility we installed for Arizona Public Service which resulted in serious injuries for four first responders last month. Of course our top priority is the health, safety, and recovery of the first responders. Fortunately we understand from statements made by the hospital that all are expected to make a full recovery. ","Regarding the event itself police immediately dispatched a team of technical and operational experts to support APS in the incident root cause investigation. APS and Fluence have committed to share what they can from the investigation especially insights that would be helpful to the entire industry and first responders in efforts to prevent similar incidents anywhere in the world. AES has been safely operating a fleet of battery based energy storage systems for over a decade and today has storage systems operating in multiple country, uses and environments. We continue to believe in the use of lithium ion batteries for energy storage and continue to see rapidly growing demand for this technology and its many applications. ","Finally turning to slide 15 today we announced the launch of an additional $100 million annual cost savings program. Our savings target is based on our current digital initiatives which are expected to be fully implemented by 2022. Although we have significantly reduced costs over the last several years we're taking our efforts to the next level by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 million asset base. As most of our business is long-term contracted at fixed U.S. prices, much of the benefits from these digital initiatives will flow to our bottom line. Specifically the main activities include utilizing AI for predictive maintenance and outage prevents. Using technologies such as robotics and drones for solar and wind maintenance and inspection and implementing process automation in administrative and support functions. ","On an annual basis we're targeting a 5% reduction in the total expense for these activities. Net of any cost we achieve so we feel very confident about our ability to achieve $100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022. Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail. ","Gustavo Pimenta","Thank you Andr\u00e9s. Today I will go over our first quarter results, improving credit profile, and capital allocation. In the first quarter we made solid progress towards our full year guidance range of a $1.28 to a $1.40. As shown in slide 17 adjusted EPS was $0.28 primarily reflecting the benefits of improved efficiencies and lower parent interest expense resulting from about $1 billion in debt pay down. This improvement was offset by the impact of asset sales and shutdowns. With our first quarter results and 2.2 gigawatts coming online in the year to go we are on track to achieve our full year guidance. ","Turning to slide 18 adjusted pre-tax contribution or PPC was $272 million for the quarter, a decrease of $16 million. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on slide 19. In the U.S. and utilities SBU relatively flat PPC reflects higher rates following the resolutions of rate cases late last year at DPL and IPL as well as lower expected asset return obligations at DPL. These impacts were partially offset by the exits of coal fired generation at DPL and Shady Point. Regarding DPLs DMR extension filing there is not much to report, would expect activity to increase as its position at the commission is complete and the new chairman is now in place. Accordingly we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020 and we continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. ","At our South America SBU lower PPC was largely driven by Argentina where we saw lower dispatch at our plants. This generation profile was in line with our projections and was expected to impact the first quarter only. Relatively flat PPC at our Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean are MCAC SBU reflects an extended plant outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama. This was partially offset by the commencement of operations at the AEC Col\u00f3n CCGT last year and outage related insurance proceeds in the Dominican Republic. ","Finally in Eurasia, lower results primarily reflect the sales of our businesses in the Philippines and the Netherlands as well as the shift our 300 megawatt of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In Bulgaria there have been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian and we are being paid on time. ","Turning to our improving credit profile on slide 23. Since we first established our goal of reaching investment grade in 2016 we have reduced apparent debt by $1.3 billion or 26%. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the rating agencies and remain confident in our ability to attain investment grade rating in 2020. We believe this improvement in our credit profile is helping us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility but also to enhance our equity valuation. Over the next few years we expect our credit metrics to show further improvement through growth in our parent free cash flow as well as modest additional delevering. While apparent credit improvement is a key focus of ours we are also constantly looking for opportunities to strengthen the capital structure of our subsidiaries. This is demonstrated by the $1.5 billion of liability and management transactions we have executed so far this year at three businesses alone Gener, Tiete and DPL. In all cases we're able to take advantage of good market conditions to extend maturities and lower interest rates. For instance at DPL we refinanced $400 million of the Holdco 2021 notes increasing the term by 8 years and reducing the interest rates by 290 basis points. ","Now to 2019 parent capital allocation on slide 24, beginning on the left hand side source reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash including 725 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also include $384 million in assets sale proceeds which is $16 million higher than our previous disclosure for 2019. Proceeds include approximately $170 million from the sell down of sPower's operating portfolio and $211 million from the sale of our businesses in Jordan and Northern Ireland announced a couple of weeks ago. Now to uses on the right hand side. Including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expected to allocate another $150 million this year to parent debt largely to strengthen our investment grade metrics and we plan to invest over 400 million in our subsidiaries leaving about 200 million of unallocated cash. ","Finally moving to our capital allocations in 2019 through 2022 beginning on slide 25. We expected our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining 800 comes from asset sale proceeds about half of which has been announced or closed this year. ","Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on slide 26, roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We expected to use $300 million for debt reduction including a portion to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planned asset sales. We are also planning to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projects PPAs. Once completed all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $670 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives. With that I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks Gustavo. Before we take your questions let me summarize today's call. 2019 is off to a good start as demonstrated by our financial results and progress on our strategic goals. We remain on track to attain investment grade ratings in 2020. We are completing our large conventional construction projects. We are signing long-term U.S. dollar denominated PPAs for renewables. We are leveraging our position and experience to expand our LNG infrastructure business and we are targeting $100 million of additional annual cost savings further enhancing the resilience of our 7% to 9% average annual growth target. Accordingly we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive double-digit total return to our shareholders. Operator we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead. ","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning Ali. ","Ali Agha","Good morning. First question Andr\u00e9s, just to get a bigger and better sense on the timing around this incremental cost reduction, so you currently have an ongoing cost reduction program giving you benefits of 100 million in 2019 and in 2020. So when does this incremental 100 million actually kick in, does it kick-in in 2021 and you said the run rate of 100 million by 2022 how much can you specifically capture in 2021 and 2022 from this program?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That's a great question. So first let me be very clear, this is additional to the programs that we have announced in the past and this is also net of any cost to achieve those savings. We feel very confident in achieving these savings because this is about 5% of expense on those categories and these initiatives are currently underway. So with that said it's also sort of growing over time because this is an annual run rate savings. So as you correctly point out, the larger benefits will be in 2021 and 2022. So you know by 2021 we should probably have about half of these savings and the full amount would be in the run rate of 2022. ","Ali Agha","Okay and then secondly the 101.5 billion that you've targeted as equity investment in new projects between now and 2022 how much of that is already in hand right now in terms of at least having the signed PPA if not construction and I know in the past you talked about potential investment by Tiete on a win company in Brazil where does that stand and is that part of this 1.5 billion?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","What this includes is that we are committed to, projects which are under construction and being completed includes all the renewables but it also includes a run rate in renewable, getting into new projects that hit that 2 to 3 gigawatts of annual capacity. So it will include a portion of those expected PPAs that we're signing as we on go because between signing and completion it is about 18 months so obviously some of the things that are in that number have not yet been signed. So it includes part of the run rate.","Gustavo Pimenta","Gustavo here. If I can complement I would say probably 70% to 80% is somewhat in the pocket, so deals that we've signed but as Andr\u00e9s said there is a proportion yet to be allocated that's expected to be captured. So things like investments in subs would fall under that category.","Ali Agha","Okay and the Tiete transaction?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","So Tiete they haven't announced yet how they're going to fund it so we can't comment on that. But if needed that would come from that $1.5 billion of projected PPAs that we have in the chart. ","Ali Agha","I see, last question, can you just remind us how much of the LNG capacity is not yet contracted and what's the timing when you think potentially you could contract and see that incremental $0.03 of earnings?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","You know as I said a lot of the infrastructure already exists. So it really depends on the timing of the additional investments. So you know we've completed what we said we would do by 2022. So basically we already have that. So I think basically we have let's see, we have probably about 30% still to go. So we have about 50 TBTUs so between the Caribbean and Central America and that just is a question of when we sign up more customers. So stay tuned, I think we are doing very well and quite frankly with relative prices today of U.S. based LNG and oil it is very attractive for customers to sign up. So we've completed what we said we would do and now we're actively pursuing those additional $0.03.","Ali Agha","Understood, thank you.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks Ali.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with BOA. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, congrats. Lots of updates this morning, so I just wanted to clarify a couple of things here if you can very quickly. First, on incremental cost savings how much of that is parent versus allocated at the subsidiary levels and then how much would you say this is incremental, what's the total amount especially of parent SG&A savings that we're talking about through 2022, just to make sure we're fine tuning things precisely here?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah, let me be clear here. So a portion of that savings will be obviously at the sub level but however this is what we expect to flow up to Corp. Okay, so this is basically we expect $100 million of savings to what hits Corp even though a lot of those savings will occur in subs but that means that obviously there will be additional savings which we'll share with our partners. So this is what actually hits AES. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And total cost savings I mean there were rather, is that SG&A kind of target just overall because I know that there was already some degree of cost savings reflected through 2022?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Obviously the SG&A a savings especially at Corp are relatively small. A lot of this is operational efficiencies, predictive maintenance, less outages, better planning. So we feel very confident because a lot of these are things which some other companies have done. So we're really leapfrogging here to put ourselves at the leading edge. As you know we hired a new Chief Information Digital Officer, Sanjeev Addala. He's working hand-in-hand with our Chief Operational Officer, Bernard Da Santos. So you know we feel very good about this and going forward we've identified where the savings would come from and it's also pretty leapfrogging and catching up with the leading edge of all of our other companies around the world.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent and then turning back to the U.S. side of the equation, you said I think about half of your earnings by 2022 versus a third today would be coming from the U.S., can you clarify especially in light of your latest procurement efforts how you are addressing ITC recognition for solar assets and how much will be tax credits when you think of that U.S. earnings contribution, I am just trying to make sure we're fine tuning things appropriately especially given the litany of different accounting approaches taken across the sector? ","Gustavo Pimenta","Sure. Julien, this is Gustavo. The 50% is mostly driven by the fact that 50% or even more of our free cash flow has been deployed in the U.S. It's more equity going to the U.S. and therefore you see that the proportion of the U.S. growing. We are growing the distribution business IPL, DPL as well so that that's the main driver. As we've mentioned in the last call from our perspective a lot of the renewables are outside the U.S. so the growth is not really from an ITC PPC recognition is not really a major driver for a 7% to 9%. And a lot of the growth is 7% to 9%. We do have a lot of deals already in the pocket like something coming online or PPC cost cutting things like that. So it's not a major driver in our case because as I said 50% is in the U.S. Even in the U.S. you have 40% wind which has a low impact. And I think what is more important our cash flow is also growing at 7% to 9% ratio which kind of reinforce the quality of the earnings.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Fair, and then lastly just if you can quickly clarify on Mexico, proper Chile, the blend and extend, what does that imply for your existing assets and just perhaps elaborate a little bit more on the opportunity side especially in Puerto Rico and Mexico given you guys haven't done much there historically?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, as we said it is sort of green, blend and extend, what does it essentially consist of. You have a long-term thermal contract where we really make our returns on the capacity payments and energy is a pass through. So we basically go to the client and say we will replace a portion of the energy being generated by the thermal plant with renewable energy if you sign a long-term PPA. So this is a win-win from both because we get a new contract for renewal and get a return on that and we still get our capacity payment. So part of this is that you have to relearn how to run our thermal plants at a lower margin to make space for renewable. ","Now in the case of Mexico we have picked up which are thermal plants. Of course in Chile we have a number of thermal plants where we've already been applying this with our large commercial and industrial customers. And in Puerto Rico you may have seen that we are in discussions with PURPA to see how we could have some modifications to allow for green, blend and extend as well. So basically we are reacting to customers desires for more green energy. In many cases the cost of the energy is lower than the variable cost of running the thermal plant and we're lowering carbon footprints in line with what they desire. And very importantly we're keeping the capacity because you know when everybody talks about renewables that's great for energy but what about capacity, the ability to retain the lights on 24\/7. So we really feel that there are two ways to do it, the green, blend and extend or energy storage. And I think we're well-positioned in both sides.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent, thank you. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","You're welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Turnure","Good morning. I wanted to ask for more color on Alto Maipo, I think you said it was 78% complete as of now and the tunneling was around 72% complete. Could you maybe comment a little bit more on that particularly on the progress of tunneling since your last update?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah, I mean we continue to execute on our plan. I think it's going very well. I believe now we have six tunnel boring machines in operation and we remain on track for what we've said in the past of completing this project by starting in 2020. So I guess that's the only update that I can really say that we're -- since we did the restructuring where the contractor has a lot more say skin in the game and applied the learnings that we've had over the last couple of years we're executing as per the plan.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, excellent. And then switching gears to Mexico, could you just kind of comment broadly on your existing assets there and the project where you've relatively recently signed a contract kind of how you're thinking about the political and regulatory environment given some of the headlines over the past three months?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, our strategy in Mexico has always been to sign a long-term dollar denominated contracts with investment grade off takers in the private sector. So we're relatively a little exposed let's say to some of the changes that they have announced for the CFE and others. So our projects continue, I think our clients are looking for green energy. In many case they're looking for the green, blend and extend. So those projects continue on track and we expect to be signing more sort of green, blend and extend projects in Mexico.","Christopher Turnure","Okay, then with that no slowdown of future project potential?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Again we remain on track and we think our strategy was very resilient and robust because from day one it was a really long-term dollar denominated contracts with investment grade off takers. And many of them are exporters for example. So they really it's you know having a dollar denominated cost is not an issue for them and actually helps them sort of with their future forecasts?","Christopher Turnure","Okay, great. Thanks Andr\u00e9s. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Thanks guys, a couple of questions, good morning. It looks like some of the currency exposures not for 2019 which I know are quite small but for 2020 which are a bit larger have shifted if I look from the Q4 presentation to the Q1 presentations, can you just talk about how you or how you've -- how your commodity -- how your currency hedging has changed and if that's the case why?","Gustavo Pimenta","No, it hasn't moved maturely Greg. Greg, this is Gustavo. It hasn\u2019t moved maturely. We continue to be mostly dollar denominated. And if anything and when there is a remaining exposure in some particular market we do pursue a hedge here at Corp to offset that. So it's not something that we are concerned with and no mature differences versus where we were before. ","Greg Gordon","Okay, great, it did look small so thank you. The second thing was with regard to the cadence of the expected backlog realization in the renewables which is slide 8. I think you're still basically assuming you over time achieving almost exactly the same amount. But I think some of the realizations have shifted from 2019 to 2020 to 2021, am I misreading that or if not can you just talk about how has it firmed up the backlog and what you're looking at?","Gustavo Pimenta","Yeah Greg, Gustavo again. Yeah, you're right. I think the only major change from the prior disclosure has been Highlander which we got the approvals, it took a little bit longer than we initially forecasted. So we move at that, you're going to see in the appendix we move on that to 2020 and 2021. So initially it was part of that was in 2019. That's the only change. So the rest is in line.","Greg Gordon","Okay, and I know -- and just to reconfirm you are assuming a favorable outcome in the DMR filing in your long-term guidance correct?","Gustavo Pimenta","Yeah, we assume a continuation, we haven't disclosed the particular number there but we assume a continuation of our support. We believe it's needed. And yes it is in our projections.","Greg Gordon","Okay, but given a) you have a guidance range and b) you've just basically added $0.10 of incremental earnings from cost savings and that if you were to not get the DMR and you were to risk adjust for not getting the DMR, are you still comfortable that you'd be in that guidance range?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","What it says again we're adding resilience to our forecasts. So the additional $100 million of cost savings realize that the DMR where it's really crucial was at DPL level. And it's crucial for DPL to undertake its modernization program. ","Greg Gordon","I completely agree with you, I am just -- I know it's an investor debate and that's why I ask. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah. Okay. Thanks Greg.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead. ","Charles Fishman","Thank you. Good morning. One of the savings in your waterfall chart slide 17 was effective tax rate for the recently ended quarter going down to 32%. I realize you don't give guidance on effect of tax rate but you can sort of back into it from the guidance you give on adjusted PPC and adjusted EPS. In the last couple of years it's been running around 30% on an annual basis, is the first quarter just normally run higher or is something changing with respect to what you're seeing on your effective tax rates because of the mix of earnings from different countries or is there any additional color you can provide?","Gustavo Pimenta","This is Gustavo again. Yeah, that's right. It's mostly driven by the mix. We're not seeing any mature change versus what we had anticipated which is somewhat between 29% and 31% for the year. But yes on a quarter after quarter we should have and it's not uncommon to have similar activity and driven by the mix. But on a full year basis it should be normalized in the 29% to 31% should be the final number.","Charles Fishman","Got it, thank you. That's the only question I had. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks Charles. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Yeah, hi, good morning. Just, could you just give us your thoughts on the political economic environment in Argentina and potential things we should be watching there for you?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure. Steve, as I have said in the past in Argentina I don't see it as anything sort of binary. So, really the question is, is there any degradation in the earnings. And we've seen a slight degradation of $0.01 to $0.02 from let's say where we were thinking maybe a year ago. So Argentina assets are excellent assets and it's a very robust business. Since I've been involved in the Argentine business since the year 2000 we've made money every year. We've paid dividends every year. We did have three years where we were unable to convert those dividends into dollars because there were currency restrictions in place. So to put it in perspective. So, first it is a very resilient business and depending on government policies there could be some degradation but it's not a binary issue I believe. ","I think with the political situation in Argentina they're having elections in October and we'll see who wins, whether it's a continuation of the current president, could be Lavagna who's a Peronist or you could have Cristina Kirchner who is running on her own. And so we'll have to see. I don't think there'll be any immediate regardless of who wins, I don't think there will be any immediate outcome or changes in this sector that would require laws for it to change. I think that the -- as I said in the past when people got very worried about the exchange rate in Argentina I said look they had a terrible harvest, 30% lower but they're increasing, they're up. If they have normal harvests and with the increase in their natural gas exports, I think reaching exports of natural gas eliminating imports I think that side looks a lot stronger. So it's really a question of what -- how the change in the regulatory structure is. We've been there before and as I said it's not a binary issue. Overall we feel cautiously optimistic that things will continue more or less as they are today.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, and then just on the battery side of that occurred, I know you're still investigating that in the light. But I'm just in some of the stories I read I think there were at least some that talked about there being fires in other parts of the world with batteries. And I don't know if you have examples of others and what might have caused those other ones just so we kind of have an idea of what it could be. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah, first what we had was a thermal event. We didn't really have a fire per say. And you're right there have been over the years, this is nothing new, over the years a number of thermal events or fires in lithium ion batteries in everything from cars to energy storage. So this is not totally new. So we have to investigate what was it that occurred in this event, exactly what was the root cause and make sure that we engineer or take all precautions to really minimize the likelihood of such an event in the past. Things are changing in terms of some of the technologies but you know we've had lithium ion batteries on a grid scale 10 to 40 megawatts operating for 10 years already without an incident. So we're investigating it, there's not much I can say at this point but as I mentioned we will share the crucial aspects of the finding to make sure that everybody takes whatever precautionary measures can be taken. So this is not -- there's not a repeat of this event.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, thank you. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill","Yeah. Thank you. You talked about some items in the quarter related to generation dispatch in Argentina and then there was some issues in Panama but you didn't modify your adjusted PPC guidance for those regions, can you talk about what you're thinking is?","Gustavo Pimenta","Yeah. Hey Greg, Gustavo here. Yes, the impact in the quarter as we mentioned in my prepared remarks present in the case of Argentina and also in Panama with Changuinola were expected. So we had that in our plan already. So 1Q came really in line with our initial projections and expectations so there was no need for us to adjust going forward. And again while we are catching up towards the year end as I said also in my prepared remarks we are having 2.2 gigawatt coming online from today until December and that's going to be a major driver of earnings going forward. So that's why you see this variance quarter after quarter. ","Gregg Orrill","Okay, thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you Brandon. Thanks everybody for joining us on today's call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and welcome to AES' Second Quarter 2018 Financial Review Call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at www.aes.com.","Today we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2018 financial review call. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 puts us at $0.52 for the first half of 2018, which is 24% higher than the $0.42 we earned in the first half of 2017. We will remain on track to hit our 2018 guidance and longer term expectations. Tom will discuss our results in more detail shortly. ","I\u2019m pleased to report that the positive momentum of the last quarter continues. During the quarter we achieved a number of milestones towards improving our risk profile and shareholder returns. Specifically, our credit ratings were recently upgraded by Fitch and Moody's and we are now rated just one notch below investment grade by all three agencies. We expect to achieve investment grade metrics by 2019 and ratings by 2020. ","We brought online the 671 megawatt Eagle Valley Combined Cycle Gas Plant in Indiana in April and we will be inaugurating the 380 megawatt CCGT and LNG regasification terminal Colon in Panama later this month. Of the remaining 3.9 gigawatts currently under construction, we expect 2 gigawatts to be commission between now and year end. ","We made significant progress in advancing our growth pipeline. Year-to-date we have signed nearly 1.5 gigawatts of renewable PPAs, which brings our backlog of capacity addition, including projects under construction to 5.7 gigawatts.","At our utilities in the U.S., IPL and DPL we settled two rate cases. Once approved, these widely supported settlements will position both utilities for future investments. We're on track to deliver $100 million in sustainable cost savings in 2018 as a result of our restructuring and transformation program. We received $310 million in net proceeds from the sale of our interest in Eletropaulo in Brazil, reducing our regulatory risk and simplifying our financial statements. ","Lastly, we continue to be a leader in applying new technologies including energy storage. Our JV with Siemens, Fluence tied 80 megawatts of new projects in three countries bringing its total to 16 and IPL\u2019s rate case settlement included one of the first rate based battery storage projects in the world. ","I will now provide more details on some of these achievements beginning on slide four. Of our 4.3 gigawatts currently under construction, nearly half are expected to come online in 2018. Since our last call we have made significant progress on these projects, which I will highlight on the following few slides starting with a 380 megawatt Combined Cycle Plant in Panama on slide five. ","I'm pleased to report that the regasification terminal is complete and that it has accepted the first shipment of LNG in Central American history. We expect that the entry of low cost U.S. LNG will transform the Central American energy sector, much as it has in the Dominican Republic.","Construction of the combined cycle power plant is nearly complete and we expect to achieve COD in September, on-time and on-budget. The project will provide long term and predictable U.S. dollar denominated returns. The storage tank is expected to be completed in 2019. Approximately 48 of the 70 tera Btus of storage capacity is uncontracted and represents potential upside as natural gas use increases over time in the region. ","Now turning to our 1.3 gigawatt, Southland Combined Cycle Plant, which is a redevelopment of our existing gas facilities in Southern California. Construction is proceeding as planned, with the project now 40% complete and on track to be operational by the first half of 2020. ","Next in Hawaii, we're delivering two solar-plus storage facilities for a total of 47 megawatts of solar and 34 megawatts of five hour duration energy storage on the Island of Kaua'i. The first of these pioneering projects is under construction and will satisfy energy demand during peak hours, as well as the rest of the day. ","The second for the U.S. Navy is expected to begin construction later this year. Once both of these projects are completed, they will represent the largest solar-plus storage installation in the world. ","Finally, we're making good progress at our 1.3 gigawatt Thermal Plant OPGC 2 in India. Construction is advancing as planned. The project is now 96% complete and we expect the plant to come online by the end of this year on budget. ","As you may recall, AES Gener successfully restructured the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile in May. Since closing the restructuring, the main contractor Strabag is performing in line with the revised EPC contract and has been meeting the agreed upon construction milestones. Alto Maipo is now 68% complete, including 56% of the tunneling work and the rate of progress on tunneling has significantly improved as of late. We expect Alto Maipo to achieve commercial operations in 2020. Our remaining construction projects are renewable energy. These projects are proceeding as planned and will be key contributors to our earnings and cash flow growth for 2020. ","Now turning to slide 10. We have been reshaping our portfolio to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders, while lowering risks, including reducing our carbon footprint. Our focus is on increasing the share of natural gas and renewable projects with long term U.S. dollar denominated contracts. We're earning attractive returns on our equity investments by utilizing our existing platforms, global scale, lower cost capital partners and non-recourse financing. ","On a portfolio basis, our investments are projected to produce low to mid-teens IRRs on average assuming conservative terminal values. We expect our projects in Latin America to earn returns better than the portfolio average. ","As you can see on slide 11, so far this year we signed 1.5 gigawatts of long term PPA's for renewable projects and now expect to exceed our internal projection of 2 gigawatts for the full year 2018. Year-to-date, sPower has signed long term PPAs for 1.2 gigawatts with large credit worthy C&I customers such as Microsoft and Apple as well as utilities. This is more than double the 500 megawatts annually assigned PPAs that we expected to achieve when we acquired sPower last year. ","In light of our progress this year, we are on pace to assign 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs annually for 2019 and 2020. This would result in 7.5 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs being signed through 2020, all of which would be online by 2022. ","To summarize, as shown on slide 12, we expect to add 11.8 gigawatts of new capacity through 2022. This includes 5.7 gigawatts of projects under construction, plus 9 PPAs which we referred to as our backlog, as well as 6 gigawatts of additional PPA's we expect to sign through 2020. Most of the capital needed for these projects will be funded by non-recourse financing and partner equity. Our equity requirements for these projects will be funded from our internally generated cash. Tom will discuss our capital allocation plan through 2020 shortly. ","As I had noted, our goal is to earn attractive returns while greening our portfolio. As you can see a slide 13, renewables make up 75% of the 11.8 gigawatts of new capacity additions. The remainder is conventional generation, all of which is currently under construction and expected to come online through 2020. ","This growth will significantly extend our average contract life from eight years currently to 10 years by 2020 and help us achieve our goal of reducing our carbon intensity by 25%. We are also working on enhancing some of our current contracts by blending and extended existing PPAs, by adding renewable energy. We call this approach green blend and extend and we will provide more color on future calls. ","I would like to emphasize that we do not plan to grow simply for the sake of adding megawatts. We will invest in new projects if and only if we can earn attractive risk adjusted returns.","Finally turning to slide 14, we continue to be a leader in applying new technologies such as battery based, energy storage, since our last call of Fluence, our joint venture with Siemens, have signed contracts when additional 80 megawatts and delivered eight projects with a total capacity of 55 megawatts. Fluence has now delivered a total capacity of 271 megawatt. Total deliveries will exceed 550 megawatt in 16 countries once their existing backlog is installed. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financial results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail. ","Tom O'Flynn ","Thank Andr\u00e9s. Good morning. I'll cover our second quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. We continue to make good progress towards our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $1.15 to $1.25 with $0.52 earned year-to-date. ","As shown on slide 16, EPS was $0.25 in the second quarter, reflecting high contributions from South America and MCAC, as well as debt pay down at the parent. Offsetting this was the sales of our coal plants in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Our results also reflect $0.02 from a quarterly tax rate of 36% which is a timing issue as, we continue to expect a full year tax rate in the 32% to 34% range. ","Onto slide 17, adjusted PTC during the quarter was $255 million, an increase of $13 million. I\u2019ll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on slide \u201818. In the U.S. and Utilities operations were generally in line with the prior year. PTC was down a part due to the timing of a planned outage in Hawaii which occurred in second quarter this year versus the first quarter of last year. ","Regarding sPower the business has outperformed our expectations since we acquired it, both from an operational and development perspective. Since the acquisition, sPower has distributed about $100 million in cash to the parent or roughly a quarter of our original investment. The business also continues to have good access to capital markets, having just closed a $500 million portfolio refinancing with a 14 year average life and a 5% coupon. ","Back to our second quarter PTC, in South America improved results reflect higher contract pricing in Columbia, as well as higher contracted sales and lower interest expense at AES Gener in Chile. In MCAC higher PTC was largely driven by the Dominican Republic due to the completion of the Combined Cycle last year, as well as improved availability. Finally in Eurasia, our results primarily reflect the sale of our business in the Philippines and Kazakhstan.","Shifting to our year-to-date results on slide 22, adjusted EPS increased $0.10 to $0.52, which represents 43% at the midpoint of our full year guidance versus 39% achieved year-to-date 2017. Our results reflect higher contributions from U.S. and Utilities, including higher regulated rates and lower maintenance expenses of DPL. ","In South America contracted sales were up in Chile, Colombia and Argentina and we also benefit from lower parent debt. These impacts were partially offset by the asset sales in Eurasia. ","Turning to our improving credit profile beginning on slide 23, in the third quarter of 2016 we established a goal of reaching investment grade. At that time we had $5 billion in parent debt and leverage of 4.9x. We expect to end this year with $3.8 billion in debt and leverage 4.3x. Our goal is to achieve investment grade metrics of below 4x by 2019. ","As shown on slide 24, the rating agencies are recognizing our commitment and actions. As of third quarter 2016, we rated BB- and BB. Today after recent upgrades by Fitch and Moody's we are rated BB+ by all three agencies just one notch below investment grade. We continue to believe that obtaining investment grade rating will help us not only to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation. ","Now to 2018 current capital allocations on slide 25, which is in line with our prior disclosure. Beginning on the left hand side, sources reflect $1.9 billion of total available discretionary cash, including $600 million to $675 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also reflect $1.2 billion in net asset sale proceeds from Masinloc in the Philippines and Eletropaulo in Brazil. ","Now to uses on the right hand side of the slide. Including the 8.3% dividend increase we announced in December, we\u2019ll be returning $345 million to shareholders this year. We've used over $1 billion to reduce parent debt, including revolver drawings. We plan to invest $300 million in our subsidiaries, primarily for projects under construction, leaving about $40 million of unallocated cash. ","Finally moving to our capital allocation from 2018 to 2020 beginning on slide 26, we continue to expect our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, which is roughly half of our current market cap. But half our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The rest comes from our $2 billion asset sales target, $1.2 billion which we have achieved to-date. ","Turning to uses for this discretionary cash on slide 27, roughly two-thirds has been allocated towards current dividend and delevering. Earlier Andr\u00e9s laid out 11.8 gigawatts of additions, 60% of which is coming online in 2020. Our equity needs for this capacity are manageable as we bring in partners and use non-recourse financing. ","Specifically we're planning to fund $800 million for our equity investments in our backlog and project PPAs coming online through 2020. This is only $50 million more than our expectations on our last call. This quarter we are also showing $150 million for our equity investments in projected PPAs coming on line in 2021. Once completed, all these projects will contribute to our growth through 2020 and beyond. ","The remaining $600 million of unallocated cash which is largely weighted to 2019 and 2020 is available to create additional shareholder value, including investments in subsidiaries and dividend growth. As you know, our annualized dividend growth rate is 9% over the last three years and 27% over the last four. Although, we don't plan to continue growing the dividend at such an exceptional rate, we expect dividend growth to remain an important part of our value proposition. We review our dividend annually with our Board in December. ","With that, I'll turn it back to Andr\u00e9s. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski ","Thanks Tom. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. Our performance year-to-date puts us on track to achieve our 2018 guidance. We are well positioned to achieve investment grade credit metrics in 2019. Our 5.7 gigawatt backlog of long term contracted projects will enable us to achieve our key objectives of profitable growth and greening the portfolio. ","We expect to generate substantial amounts of discretionary cash from 2018 through 2020, which we will deploy consistent with our capital allocation framework and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 8% to 10% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2020. ","Operator, we are ready to take your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead. ","Ali Agha ","Thank you, good morning. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning Ali. ","Ali Agha ","Good morning. My first question, you didn't bring this up on your remarks. If you could give us an update on where things stand with Maritza and Bulgaria, and more I think to the point as you've said to us before, I think that we should be expecting something to change there on the contract eventually, either a buyout or restructuring. ","And my question is, when you sort of model the different scenarios with what could play out with Maritza eventually, how that does that impact that 8% to 10% profile of earnings growth you\u2019ve laid out \u201818 through \u201920. Does it change it in any way? Is that already factored in? How should we be thinking about that, that's my first question? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure, well we aren't in any formal negotiations yet with the government. As I\u2019ve said in the past, an issue was raised with the European Commission regarding illegal state aid. It hasn't been declared as such, but you know both sides are expected to begin negotiations sometime in the future.","As I\u2019ve said, we have a very strong contract. We're being paid on time. Bulgaria is an investment grade country; it's growing and the situation of our uptick or NEK continues to improve. So really you know it's very too early to say when this will come out. And as I said you know, we have a good contract and we will defend our interests. The plant is needed in Bulgaria, so you know we will keep you informed of this in terms of sort of how this would affect our future. ","You know we do have contingencies in our numbers and we have to see where this turns out. There are a range of outcomes and we don\u2019t have a satisfactory outcome. Obviously arbitration is a possibility. So sort of stay tuned. There will be more information as it\u2019s happening. We really don't have much more to report than we did on the prior call. ","Ali Agha ","Okay. Second question, you laid out some of the new projects, PPAs backlog that will likely come online beyond 2020, 2021 and 2022, etcetera. So in that context, I wanted to get a sense of what your visibility is for your growth profile beyond 2020 as you start factoring these projects in, and is the growth rate that you laid out for us through 20 sustainable going forward. Do you have line of sight? Can you give us some sense of how the profile would look like beyond 2020? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well Ali, we will update you on that after are \u2013 on our fourth quarter call. I think what we are showing here is that we do have a very robust pipeline of projects, and that as we continue to growth the renewable pipeline as to develop competitive advantages of scale and of combinations of technology, I expect this pipeline to continue. So I can't really give you any specific number, but I think that as time passes, I think you're seeing the robustness of the pipeline, the many opportunities that we have and that you know how fast we grow will depend on making sure that we have attractive returns on that growth. ","I would add that you know besides just megawatts, we have other projects such as the LNG and it's not only the regasification terminal that we should be inaugurating within 10 days officially in Panama, but we also have the eastern gas pipeline in the Dominican Republic. So we have some businesses which are growing in addition to just the megawatts. ","Ali Agha ","Last question, more near term. You alluded to the fact that the tax rate impact in the quarter has been more of a timing issue should come down in the second half. But if you looked at the overall earnings that you have reported and generated though the first half, that you said it\u2019s up 24% year-over-year, how does that compare to your own internal budget in the context of the full year when we look at the adjusted earnings that have come through, through the first half? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think as you know Tom and I said, I mean we're on track to hit our numbers and sometimes tax rates can be a little bit lumpy for us, because it depends on where the earnings came from specifically. So we really \u2013 I wouldn't read too much into a sort of a one quarter tax rate and you know we really planned for the year. ","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yeah, and Ali its Tom. We pointed out that last year our earnings will shape the same. We tend to have third quarter and fourth quarter are historically strong for us. So this is consistent with where we started the year. ","Ali Agha ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead. ","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So going back to the growth at sPower, I remember that when you get acquired the business, I think the assumption was that there would be about 500 megawatt of growth per year. Now it seems you are significantly exceeding that rate, yet you are keeping your earnings growth projections unchanged through 2020. Why is that? Is it just because the growth is more towards 2021 and beyond and hence there isn\u2019t a positive earnings, you know providing upside to your growth rate till 2020. ","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Well, you know I think, thinking of sort of our growth rate, I would make some mentions. You know one is sPower obviously it\u2019s a big contributor. We are also doing very well in our distributed energy business, it\u2019s smaller, but it's also a big contributor to this. ","Overall about 50% of our renewables growth is wind more less, 50% is solar, 50% is U.S., 50% is outside, so we have a very robust wide portfolio. So you know I think that you know again, we\u2019ll talk about our longer term projections. But as you mentioned, there is \u2013 we\u2019re a portfolio, we have a number of things going on, so you know we feel uncomfortable about hitting our numbers for this year and we feel comfortable with our guidance to 2020 of 8% to 10% growth. ","Angie Storozynski","Okay, now you mentioned that the incremental growth would be financed with internally generated cash flows, but the thing we all seem stories about you potentially divesting a share of some of your operating assets. I'm talking about the contracted renewables. Could you talk about that? ","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yeah Angie, it\u2019s Tom. Yeah, we have mentioned in the past that we, after closing sPower we did get some inbounds on buying some piece of operating assets. We continue to see if that's a an opportunity. That would be something that would fit into our asset sale piece, the 1.2 versus $2 billion, so the $800 million to go. We'll see and continue to think about those opportunities in conjunction with our partner income. ","But those are really sell downs of partial pieces of operating assets. Obviously the front side of the business, the growth development side, we want to keep that driving forward as it is, and if we did things like that, that\u2019s probably we\u2019ll continue to be the operator, owner-operator-manager, which is also adding value as they are now. By year end they\u2019ll be self-operating in the solar, about 85% of their facilities, which is adding some incremental margin on the upside. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah NGOs, so to put this in context you know, we will be on looking for opportunity to leverage our equity, by bringing in lower cost capital partners. So you know whether that be a partial sell down in different assets, that allows us to use our equity towards higher returns us, for example development and then putting into operation plants and then once they are up and operating if we can get lower cost capital, then that's what we will do. ","So you know over the last years we've raised quite a lot of capital by selling assets, and let's say reinvesting some of that capital in higher return projects. So this is you know right on our strategy, so expect more of that. ","Angie Storozynski","And lastly, I know you\u2019ve said actually twice already that you will be providing us with updates on growth beyond 2020 only on the fourth quarter call. But during this this year's fourth quarter call you didn't roll forward your earnings to 2021 as you had historically provided. You know we have this concern us among investors about your contract and that you are rolling off and providing a potential earnings clash. So could you at least give us a sense directionally if 2021 would be an apt year versus 2020 based on what you see currently? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","You know, as I see that really when we don't have any cliffs in 2021, actually we have a lot of assets coming online in 2020. So you know I would just say that the momentum, you know 2021 should be a good year, because that's when all these assets will be online and you know that includes things like the energy storage, 400 megawatt hours of energy storage coming online in Southland. ","In terms of cliff, we really you know \u2013 the only \u2013 we have contracts falling off at AES Gener in 2023 and that's only half of the contracts. So Gener is you know pretty much fully contracted through 2023, so know we don't see a cliff in 2021. ","Angie Storozynski","Okay, thank you. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning.","A - Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, thank you for the time. I wanted to follow up a little bit on Angie\u2019s direction for questioning. Can you elaborate a little bit on the equity investments that you intend to make in the renewable segment just to make sure we're clear about this. ","I think I heard you say for instance in \u201821 that you're going to put about $150 million in that specific project here. (NYSE:A) Is that a good cadence of the capital, and (NYSE:B) historically we think about maybe low to mid-teens returns on these kinds investment. Is that basically to say that perhaps that\u2019s equal to $0.02 to $0.03 of earnings accretion based off of that investment or is it maybe a little bit lower than that just given the return profile of contracted sellers. ","A - Tom O\u2019Flynn","Hey Julien, it\u2019s Tom. So on my slide 27, the $150 million, this is projected \u2013 obviously it depends upon capital structure, partnership things and also location of projects, but we had $150 million that could be invested in 2020 for projects to go COD in \u201921; that's roughly half of the amount of say \u201821 COD projects. ","So in terms of cadence if you just think about the layers, cadence is probably 300 in total renewables, probably about $300 million, maybe $350 million a year, something like that, which if you look back at our history, I think at least the last five years, that\u2019s generally about our equity investment in projects. It's been about 300 to 400 per year and so this would be very consistent. Obviously less lumpy in things like Colon or other things of that nature and more going to more smaller investments in renewables in the U.S. and obviously in our key markets. ","In terms of returns, I think generally in the U.S. we're seeing low double digits and internationally depending upon where we are, we see low to mid-teens. So we expect those to be accretive as we move along and we would factor that into our guidance updates for 2021 and beyond. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Let me be clear about this, just a little clear. So you know basically the thought process is 300 to 350 a year in cadence and you're saying low double digits. Is that an IRR or is that an ROE in the current year? i.e., should we take say the mid-point of that, say 300 to 400, 350; put say a low teens ROE on that to kind of get a sense for what the earnings contribution is, say about a nickel or so. ","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Those are fair for ROE\u2019s and probably if I was going to use the cadence, I\u2019d use 300 to 400 and those are reasonable for ROE\u2019s. Some of them are a little bit \u2013 it depends on the region. Some of them are a little more near term ROE beneficial and some are a little more sloped. But as a portfolio those IR\u2019s are pretty reflected in those ROE\u2019s. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And this is \u2013 and to be further clear about this and distinguished, on slide 50 you talked about global renewables with a total equity investment of 136. How does that compare, just to make sure we're not double counting here and thinking about this separately? ","Ali Agha","I\u2019m sorry, which slide again?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Slide 50 talks about global renewables. That's a separate investment bucket for equity contributions than the\u2026","Ali Agha","So these are the projects in construction. So I think so as Tom mentioned you known on an annual basis we are talking about $300 million to $400 million of equity investments moving forward. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","This is a slightly different cut of that, right? $300 million to $400 million and then right now you've got $136 million actively invested, but this is the 136\u2026 [Cross Talk]","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","\u2026 Cash power they\u2019ve signed 1.2 and all our numbers are AC year-to-date, so most of those projects have not yet started construction. They will shortly like the big Microsoft-Apple project and Virginia will start construction next quarter, so it's not right. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So 136 is a small factor of the total equity.","A - Andr\u00e9s Gluski","It\u2019s a small piece yeah, because it just has the stuff that's already gone NPP, it\u2019s already construction. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And sorry, just sort of another one there just to clarify. The source of the success from the solar, I mean I know you have a list of projects thus far. But if you were to define as power sort of MO in the store space, is this principally [inaudible] contacts. I mean where are we basically orienting themselves for opportunity?","A - Tom O\u2019Flynn","I\u2019d say sPower is right at probably 60 \u2013 on new business is shifting towards 50-50 wind and solar. They are probably right now about 60% solar, 40% wind, but they are shifting. When we closed on the acquisition, they were about 85% solar. They were making the shift, they are very client focused. So folks like Microsoft and Apple are obviously great clients, so we\u2019d look to do additional business with those and other clients like that. We do still do some utility transactions and you know some other large utility type players such as a couple of CCA's in California.","Our smaller DE business tends to be more program focused, so they look at a state program and then build that on a state program, we are doing a lot of that right now in Massachusetts. Hawaii project, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, the two solar storage projects is opportunities for the EP business in Hawaii. So they can be more regional focused. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah, and Julien don't forget that 50% of this is outside the U.S. and they were mainly C&I customers, you know investment grade, dollar contract, long term dollar contracts. So it\u2019s a mix of things, and again to the extent that we can bring in partner equity or sell down, you know that also improves our returns. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great, excellent! Thank you very much. ","A - Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you, Julien. ","Operator","The next questions comes from Christopher Turnure of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. ","Christopher Turnure ","Great, good morning. Andr\u00e9s you mentioned in your prepared remarks briefly that you continue to be I guess hopeful for new LNG projects, but I was hoping you could give us more color there on either the existing Panama or Dominican Republic contracts. The types of customers you might be talking to, duration and when we might have an update their?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay. Well, I think that you know first of all what we're doing in Panama is replicating what we've done successfully in the Dominican Republic. So in the Dominican Republic we have the very nice business of selling to industrials and transportation LNG at our facility. So we have those capabilities built into the Panama project already. ","Now it will take some time for the Panama Central American market to develop. Now we have a strategic alliance with ENGIE to market our gas from these two facilities and they can create products for clients, for example, that are offset some of the risks of having \u2013 you know competing with diesel or competing with heavy fuel oil for clients to sign up for long term gas contract. ","So in Panama what we are saying is basically the 22 tera Btus will be used by the plant, our plant coming online. There are more plants in the area that could be converted and would require the construction of some gas pipelines. We are fully capable of you know again, discharging from the LNG from that plant as well. So that\u2019s a market that\u2019s going to take some time to develop as it has in the Dominican Republic. ","Now, in the Dominican Republic we have a very significant growth with the building of the Eastern gas pipeline that's about 12 tera Btus and the offtakers Barrick. So again, investment-grade, offtakers for its mines and it's basically converting its generation at those mines to gas. There is also potential for you know transportation in that area. So once that eastern gas pipelines is built, there is a lot of other potential diesel plants and heavy fuel plants and transportation that could be converted. ","So it\u2019s taking a successful business case from the Dominican Republic replicating it in Central America. So the Panamanian market is very attractive, but you know we could also use it as a hub to deliver gas into other Central American countries, such as Honduras.","Christopher Turnure ","Okay, great. And then just remind me, how much if any capacity is left in the Dominican Republic right now? Is it a percentage of I guess the total capacity?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I would say in this Dominican Republic we probably have another 15 tera Btus, 20 tera Btus to go, because that\u2019s a 80 tera But tank, so that would be the world about 60. So it gives an idea of how we can fill it up. Now again, it's very attractive to do tolling and which is what we do without taking any commodity risk on these projects. You know longer term we have mentioned in the past we have a potential very large similar project in Vietnam. So that would be more sort of a 2023 project. ","Christopher Turnure ","Okay, and then switching gears, could you give us more color on your decision to sell the Chilean transmission assets and pay off debt down there. Kind of anything specific about those assets that made the time appropriate to sell here? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well you know AES Gener is doing sort of a restructuring program of its asset, and so it\u2019s sold a gas peaking plant and it solid the transmission assets we think for you know attractive prices, and it\u2019s used those proceeds to pay down debt. ","So it\u2019s you know similar, let\u2019s say to what AES has done and in terms of we\u2019ve sold assets that we think are more valuable to others and non-core assets and taken those funds and used the delver the company, so it\u2019s very similar. ","Christopher Turnure ","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks Andr\u00e9s.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolf Research. Please go ahead. ","Steve Fleishman","Yeah, good morning. A couple of quick questions; first any risks you are needing to manage from the tariff trade war issues. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay, you\u2019re talking about the tariffs on solar panels?","Steve Fleishman","And more broadly. ","Tom O\u2019Flynn","More broadly. And more broadly -- no quite frankly we're not much affected if at all. I would say a first the biggest one year you could mention sort of NAFTA negotiations in Mexico. Remember that our strategy has been to contract long term dollars with private sector. So you know we're really not seeing any effect in any of our markets directly. If you're talking about solar panels in the U. S., both sPower and our distributed energy you know have sufficient panels on contract and on attractive terms for \u201818 and \u201919. So we're well positioned and quite frankly some of the uncertainty favor I think the bigger players such as us.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, good, and then just in terms of \u2013 so it sounds like the kind of accelerated renewables investment is already embedded in your 8% to 10% growth rate for 2020, that\u2019s correct. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That\u2019s correct. ","Steve Fleishman","Okay, and could you be to agree that it\u2019s still the same number and that\u2019s additive to the growth. Could you be a little bit more clear on what areas maybe are a little less than before or you kind of higher within the range?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think again we\u2019re within our range. I would say you know this is on our strategy of greening our portfolio. Remember we\u2019ll also be selling down some assets, you know as we\u2019ve been doing so you have the give and take. ","But basically the way I think about this, the overall arching theme here is really derisking. So in derisking we're going towards a you know more longer term contracts, more dollar contracts, less construction risks, because they are more individual small projects rather than large projects and you know we obviously have a contingency in our numbers and so you know stay updated, but basically this is very positive news. ","I think that if you notice, the chart we put up for the returns on renewables in the U.S. increased and we had a 10% average IRA up to 11 you know and we think we\u2019ll continue to make progress there. So you know overall I think the news is very good and the way to think about is it our portfolio continues to be less risky you know and then the portfolio in the past and it\u2019s you know in line with an investment grade company. ","Steve Fleishman","Okay, and then just maybe lastly, since sPower is still relatively newer to the company, can you just maybe give a little more color on kind of the process from \u2013 I think you said it\u2019s done better than you expected, operationally. I assume financially as well, so far is that true?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah, I mean the answer is yes. I mean again we are quite conservative on our terminal values on our growth prospects. So when we bought it, if you recall, on our earnings call we were talking about 500 megawatts of year of signed PPAs and obviously we've done better. You know at the same time you know we were hitting our return criteria and finding ways to improve that. So I would say overall it\u2019s a good start ","Steve Fleishman","Any expansion of the growth is more, because you are just seeing a lot more opportunities at your returns than you initially expected. Is that\u2026","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think a better way to phrase it Steve might be that we were conservative. You know we were hoping for this. But on the other hand we were conservative and saying you know what is a you know P95 and that\u2019s what we were talking about, so you know we're very pleased with it. ","You know we are also very pleased with our distributed energy unit. It\u2019s doing you know probably three to four times the business we had originally anticipated when we bought that business. So you know, this in generally we've been conservative and likewise we\u2019re also being very conservative about terminal values when we calculate our returns. ","Steve Fleishman","And then one last question, just in the U.S. on the solar projects I assume you booked IPCs upon startup and then when did you address PPC's for the 10 year, and just thinking about the way the earnings layout of the two segments?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah Steve, generally we are not \u2013 we are using tax equity. We expect to continue to use tax equity for the next couple years, but from an earnings standpoint PPC dos come through via tax equity to our earnings and then ITC does help buy a tax equity in the initial couple of years for solar.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you.","Operator","The next questions comes Lasan Johong of Auvila Research Consulting. Please go ahead. ","Lasan Johong ","Thank you. Great call. I love the clarity, so I appreciate it, thank you very much. But I got a few questions (A) Andr\u00e9s, the pipeline business in Dominican Republic, is that going to be a \u2013 is that one a one off project or is this something that you guys want to delve into more deeply on a more broader basis. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We had one pipeline in the Dominican Republic, going from Andres to out DTP facility. So this would be you know getting us to a larger market, because it\u2019s not only within Santo Domingo, it's going to the east where there is a....","Lasan Johong ","No, I understand that, but \u2013 I apologize for interrupting. I understand that, but is pipeline going to be another investment vehicle going forward or is this going to be on a one off basis depending on the need for a particular project. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Basically you know I would say we're not getting into the pipeline business. I mean if a pipeline is needed for example in Panama to a specific demand, maybe like there's a couple plants within say a 10 mile radius, then we will we will build it, but it\u2019s very much tied to the facility. So we're not going to build a separate pipelines that aren't sort of helping us realize the value, you know the value that our storage and reclassification has. So it will be very linked to that. We're not getting into the pipeline business otherwise.","Lasan Johong ","Great! On the investment grade rating, once you change investment grade rating, it kind of frees up a lot of issues that were kind of handcuffs if you will in past transactions. So is it possible at that point to bring some businesses up to the current level. Say for example DPL and IPL could be at the parent levels to insure for example that the interest expense reductions are not limited at the parent level, something like that or are there any other structural changes you would make with the changes in the investment grade rating. ","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yeah, it\u2019s Tom I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll change our basic philosophy of having our subsidiaries, be it standalone, nonrecourse entity. As you know most of those entities are investment grade rated or investment grade structures in the event of not going to investment grade countries. DPL has recently become investment grade. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll change \u2013 and the changes you said would not help us from a \u2013 structural change, like that would not help us from the US tax perspective.","But in general we feel the shift to investment grade we think will help \u2013 when we primarily focused on it for our equity valuation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change. There are a lot of things that we cannot do today, but we will able to do. I feel quite comfortable with our financial flexibility as we stand today and the best part is [inaudible] support and demonstration of approving this profile. ","Lasan Johong ","Well Tom, at some point the cash flows are going to be kind of overwhelming, as you are not be able to use the money to pay down debt. So what\u2019s the kind of the longer term plans for that massive excessive cash flow coming? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think we\u2019ll use our capital allocation framework and we\u2019ll keep you updated and we\u2019ll have to see. But I think again, what Tom was saying, we've been able I think to do a number of very good sale of assets, of non-core assets and part of that is that you know we really had the financial flexibility to wait until the timing was right and get the right deal going forward. So becoming investment grade is I think will give us even greater financial flexibility and make us more robust for any changes in capital markets. ","Lasan Johong ","Yeah, but what are you going to do with all this cash flow coming at you in the next \u2013 hopefully in the next three or four years? Well, you can\u2019t use that money to pay down debt. There\u2019s not going to be enough debt left to pay down, so what\u2019s the plans for that excess cash?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We\u2019ll keep you updated when that happens. ","Lasan Johong ","Okay, last question, AES has gone through an incredible amount of transformation since 2000. I\u2019ve been following you since 1998. What does AES look like in five years? I have a pretty good understanding of the picture now, because of today's call, but I just want to get it straight from you guys. Are you guys shifting more and more towards renewables and kind of laying back on conventional generation. Is that kind of the idea of where you are talking about? ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well definitely as I said you know, we're reducing risk and part of that is greening the portfolio. We think that\u2019s part of our risk reduction program. That's also quite frankly in some markets where the demand is. You know if you want to get new PPAs in the U.S. market and its heavily weighted towards renewables. ","Now we do see a transition. We do think that having the existing conventional assets gives us an advantage, because you know renewables are energy, but they are really not capacity. So the two ways to get to capacity is you can either put in battery and that's great because you can sell a lot of batteries, but that you're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars globally would have to be invested. ","And in the transition you can use your existing plant, be it hydro, gas or coal and actually some of the green blend of extent we're seeing has very interesting possibilities, which is a combination of you know low cost energy from renewables [inaudible] combined with the capacity of the coal plant for example in some markets or gas plants.","So, you know what do I think of the next five years? Well, we\u2019ll be leading that transition in many markets. We\u2019ll continue to be leading in the new technologies, whether it be combining solar storage or quite frankly combining the solar with conventional as well. We hope to be a leader in the market as well. ","Lasan Johong ","Thanks a lot. I'd just like to add one more question. In Vietnam you said you know it\u2019s difficult to replicate the Colon type projects. Does that mean that you would also look into the potential of exporting gas from Vietnam to say Cambodia and Thailand?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","In this case I mean mostly it\u2019ll be total length, so it would be a very big facility and that would be \u2013 there are several trenches of combined cycle gas plants that go with that. So you know at this stage you know I think that yeah that the possibility exists. You know we have a MOU signed with Petro Vietnam and it would have to be really what their policy is at that point. So that\u2019s ways off as I said. That would be more like a 2023 project. ","Lasan Johong ","Thank you. Great call! ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you.

And I would now like to turn the call over to your conference host today, to Mr. Ahmed Pasha. Sir, you may begin.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Cre [ph]. Good morning, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings call of The AES Corporation. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at AES.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your joining us today. I will begin with a quick review of our 2012 and then update you on our longer-term strategy. Tom will then discuss our results and 2013 guidance in more detail.","On Slide 4, we finished 2012 with strong operating and financial results with adjusted EPS of $1.24. This represents a 22% increase relative to 2011 and is the highest adjusted EPS that we have achieved in the last 10 years. Similarly, we recorded a 33% increase in proportional free cash flow. These results were achieved despite headwinds at 3 of our larger businesses, AES Gener, Eletropaulo and DP&L, and reflect our commitment to pull multiple levers, including share repurchases and cost reductions, to deliver results.","Also in 2012, we made significant progress in executing on our strategic plan, which we laid out in September of 2011. At that time, we identified 3 primary objectives for enhancing shareholder value, as described on Slide 5: first, improving the profitability of our existing portfolio; second, narrowing our geographic and business focus through asset sales to simplify our story, reduce risk and enhance our returns; and third, optimizing capital allocation. I will review our progress on each of these 3 objectives since we started to implement the plan.","First, with respect to improving the profitability of our portfolio, we are focused on 3 key areas. As you can see on Slide 6, by rationalizing corporate overhead and development costs, we have reduced G&A expenses by $90 million. I am pleased to report that this is 38% more than our updated 2012 target of $65 million in savings. We're also looking hard at lowering the operating cost of our businesses, as discussed on Slide 7. To that end, we have reorganized into 6 market-facing strategic business units, or SBUs. This reorg will allow us to better align the businesses within each region, extract synergies across the portfolio and be more responsive to changes in the marketplace. Looking on our 2012 cost reduction efforts, we are on track to realize $145 million of recurring annual cost savings by 2014.","The next area of focus is achieving positive regulatory outcomes and leveraging our commercial skill set and portfolio. I'd like to provide a brief update on regulatory proceedings in Ohio, Brazil and El Salvador on Slide 8.","At DP&L, our Electric Security Plan, or ESP application, is designed to balance DP&L's need to maintain its financial integrity to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, or PUCO's, desire for a more rapid evolution to market-based rates. If approved, the proposed ESP will allow DP&L to collect a non-bypassable stability rider, which, along with other aspects of our filing, will enable the company to earn a reasonable return on equity.","In terms of the next milestones, we are currently in settlement negotiations with various interested parties. In parallel, the formal ESP approval process is moving forward, and the hearing indicates a schedule to begin March 11. If we do not reach a settlement, we expect the PUCO to rule on our ESP filing through the formal process by July 6. In the interim, we are operating under our prior rate plan, which was extended by the commission in December of last year.","In Brazil, we are making progress on the tariff reset for Sul. The review process commenced in December of 2012, and a public hearing is currently under way. The national regulator, ANEEL, recently released a preliminary proposal, which suggests a slight reduction in the tariff for Sul using the lower weighted average cost of capital used in all recent tariff cases. ANEEL is still reviewing other aspects of the rate filing. Once implemented in April 2013, the tariff would be effective for the next 5 years.","Finally, our distribution business in El Salvador received regulatory approval for their tariff for the next 5 years. The process in El Salvador resulted in a fair and reasonable outcome and is in line with our expectations.","Now turning to Slide 9. I'd like to comment on an example of how we are leveraging our footprint and commercial skills. Our 640-megawatt Uruguaiana combined-cycle gas-fired plant is well positioned to respond to the increased need for thermal power in Brazil. As some of you may recall, back in 2008, we suspended operations of this relatively new plant, which was built around 2000. The suspension was driven by the lack of gas supply from Argentina. With the efforts of our commercial and operational teams in Brazil and Argentina earlier this month, we were able to secure gas to run this plant through the end of March. Our team in Brazil is currently working on various alternatives to return Uruguaiana to permanent service.","Now turning to Slide 10 and the second objective of our overall strategy, which is narrowing our geographic and business focus. We're executing on a plan that will not only result in a lower overall risk profile, but it will also help us to shape a more focused and efficient company. I'm pleased to report that since September 2011, we have executed diligently, and we're on track to exit 5 countries, including the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, China and Ukraine. We have announced or closed the sale of 14 businesses for total proceeds of more than $1 billion at an average PE multiple of more than 20x 2011 earnings. For 2013, we're targeting $500 million in equity proceeds from additional asset sales.","Earlier this month, we announced our plan to sell our 2 distribution businesses in the Ukraine. The price of the sale is $113 million. So we're looking to sign another $400 million or so in asset sales over the balance of the year. We will be using the proceeds in line with our capital allocation framework.","These actions demonstrate our commitment to streamline our portfolio so that we can focus on creating value in the markets where we have a compelling competitive advantage.","Now turning to Slide 11. I will cover our third strategic objective, optimizing capital allocation. Growth in shareholder value remains the number one priority for our management team, and I am encouraged by the progress we have made to date. In 2012, 82% of our discretionary investments were allocated to debt repayments, dividends and share buybacks. More specifically, since September 2011, we have prepaid more than $700 million of debt, which not only reduced our leverage and our financial risk but decreased our annual interest expense by approximately $40 million, which benefits both earnings and cash flow. We remain committed to reducing our leverage and achieving a strong BB credit metric over time.","Another lever to create per share value is to invest in our stock. To that end, we have bought back 34 million shares since September of 2011, or approximately 4% of our outstanding shares, for $390 million at an average price of $11.55. Today, we are announcing an increase in our share buyback authorization by $300 million, all of which is currently available.","We also initiated a cash dividend for the first time in almost 20 years at an annual rate of $0.16 per share, and we now have made 2 quarterly payments. From its current level, we expect to grow it modestly over time as we achieve our business and financial objectives.","The third level of our capital allocation program is an investment in our platforms. Before I highlight some of the growth opportunities that we are focused on, I would like to mention that, as we've discussed in the past, we have implemented a very rigorous investment review process where each investment is evaluated against all other alternatives on a risk-adjusted basis. Additionally, our growth plans are focused on expanding from our existing platforms, where we have a competitive advantage and where we can benefit from enhanced capital efficiency by deploying cash generated at the businesses or by using local capital markets. We could earn attractive risk-adjusted returns with our platform expansions as these projects are more efficient to develop, construct and operate than traditional greenfield projects in a new location.","Turning to Slide 12. We have a -- we have 790 megawatts of platform expansions coming online in 2013 and 2014. AES' equity investment in these project is approximately $280 million. All of these projects are expected to achieve commercial operations by the end of 2014 or earlier, so they will contribute to a full year of earnings in 2015. Based on our current forecast, we're estimating equity and cash returns of around 14% from these projects in 2015.","We see many similar opportunities to leverage our footprint. Here are some examples of potential platform expansion projects. At IPL, our integrated utility business in Indiana, we're upgrading our baseload coal-fired plants to comply with the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, or MATS, as shown on Slide 13. This would require approximately $500 million of investments from 2013 to 2016, which will be funded by a combination of IPL debt and equity. We expect to earn regulated returns under IPL's environmental tracker, approval of which is expected by the second quarter of this year. We like this kind of predictable earnings profile, particularly when investments start earning cash returns during the construction phase.","In addition, also at IPL, we're looking to replace some of our small peaking plants where we cannot justify the additional investment required to comply with environmental regulations. One of the options is to build a 650-megawatt combined-cycle gas-fired plant, which would commence construction in 2014 and be operational by 2017. If this option is approved by the regulator, we would start accruing earnings during construction.","On Slide 14, we have listed 2 near-term potential projects. The first is our 532-megawatt coal-fired Cochrane project in Northern Chile. This project capitalizes on our existing platform and the continued expansion of Chile's mining and industrial sectors, where power demand has grown by more than 5% per year over the last 10 years. We brought in Mitsubishi as a 40% partner, and we expect to reach financial close later this year. Immediately adjacent to our successful Angamos plant, the 2 projects will share some of the existing infrastructure, such as coal handling and water intake facilities, which help improve the return profile of the -- this proposed project.","The 531-megawatt Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Central Chile is another advanced development project. It is largely an expansion of our existing run-of-the-river Alfalfal facility. We have all major permits and contracts in place, and the project is not only well positioned to take advantage of significant capacity constraints, but it would also diversify our generation mix in Chile, which is currently 87% thermal. We could begin construction later this year, and we are strongly considering partners for the project.","For both projects, after nonrecourse debt and partner equity, AES Gener will invest roughly $600 million, and AES' share of that investment is approximately $425 million. Half of our investment would be funded by reduced dividends from AES Gener over the next few years, which we have included in our guidance. The other half of the investment could be funded with AES Gener corporate debt, a local equity issuance in Chile, or by additional equity from AES.","Turning to Slide 15. We have included details on 2 other development opportunities in our pipeline. In the Philippines, we're currently developing a 300- to 600-megawatt expansion of our existing 660-megawatt Masinloc facility. This proposed project is well positioned to capitalize on the robust electricity demand growth in the Philippines, which has been growing at 3.5% annually over the last decade. Projected equity requirements from AES range up to $200 million, and once again, we may consider bringing in a partner.","Finally, in India, we're making good progress on the development of a 1,300-megawatt expansion of our existing 420-megawatt OPGC plant. With low-cost, mine-mouth coal, this project is expected to be a competitive supplier in a high-growth, fuel-short and capacity-short power market. The state government of Odisha is our partner with a 51% interest in this business. The project has financing in place and is currently in the process of finalizing the remaining necessary land permits. We do not expect any significant amount of equity commitment in the near term as most of the capital costs will be funded through nonrecourse debt and cash being held or generated by the existing business.","In summary, there are significant platform expansion projects in our portfolio that will help grow the earnings power of our company. We will evaluate these potential investments against all other alternatives, such as deleveraging and returning cash to shareholders.","Now I will turn the call over to Tom, who will review our financial results for 2012, discuss our business drivers in more detail and provide 2013 guidance.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Thanks, Andres. Good morning, all. As you may have noticed from the revised format of our press release and slides, we're now presenting our results by SBU, consistent with how we manage the businesses. If you've had time to look at our 10-K, you'll also see that we've tried to provide an overview of the key drivers of each SBU. We hope you'll find these changes and additional disclosures useful and, obviously, welcome your feedback.","This morning, I'd like to review our 2012 results, including our performance against our guidance, earnings by SBU, proportional free cash flow and, finally, the execution of our 2012 capital allocation plan. Then I'll discuss our 2013 guidance and plans for capital allocation, as well as a brief update on our expected earnings trajectory through 2015.","On Slide 17, as Andres mentioned, we achieved our 2012 guidance on key metrics and delivered significant growth in earnings and cash flow.","Turning to Slide 18, we've included an analysis of our adjusted pretax contribution, or adjusted PTC, in 2012. Adjusted PTC is essentially our pretax earnings adjusted in the same way as adjusted EPS. The pie chart displays the contribution of each SBU. As you can see, our earnings are fairly evenly distributed among our SBUs. Further, our list of subsidiaries, AES Gener, Tiet\u00ea and Eletropaulo, and public filers in the U.S., namely DPL and IPL, account for 1\/3 of our adjusted PTC in 2012.","I'd like to point out that to make our financial disclosures more user friendly, on Slide 36, we provide U.S. GAAP earnings, adjusted earnings and, where relevant, market values for our interest in our publicly listed subsidiaries. And now these businesses file their quarterly financial results in advance of us, so we can disclose their earnings contributions along with our results. For example, as of yesterday, the public market value of our interest in Gener was about $3.9 billion, and our share of their 2012 adjusted earnings is about $200 million.","Adjusted PTC increased roughly $300 million in 2012, largely due to our new businesses. We also had strong operating performance in our generation facilities in the U.S. and Asia, which I'll discuss in a moment. Partially offsetting this growth, we faced challenges at our Andes and Brazil SBUs, the lower spot margins in second quarter, outages at Gener and the impact of the Eletropaulo tariff reset.","I would like to walk through the key year-over-year trends for each SBU. Given this is the first time we're discussing our results by SBU, I'll remind you of the key businesses in each.","On Slide 19, the U.S. SBU includes our 2 utilities in the Midwest, IPL and DP&L, as well as our U.S. generation business with 6,300 megawatts of capacity across the country. Overall, adjusted PTC grew by $229 million. Of this, $125 million was due to DP&L's first full year of operations as part of our portfolio. In addition, we saw growth at our plant in Hawaii and also at Southland through the temporary restart of Huntington Beach Units 3 and 4. In 2013, consistent with earlier comments, we expect a decline in U.S. adjusted PTC due in part to lower capacity prices and increased customer switching at DP&L. And also, we have planned outages at IPL.","Next, the Andes SBU on Slide 20 includes our Gener platform, which owns more than 4,700 megawatts. In addition, we have our businesses in Argentina. In 2012, Andes recorded a reduction in adjusted PTC of $139 million.","In Chile, Gener was impacted by lower spot margins due to lower energy exports from Argentina to Chile. In addition, partially due to outages in the second quarter, Gener covered some of its contracted sales with higher-cost replacement energy. These outages did not continue in the second half of 2012 as we successfully addressed the operating issues. These negative impacts were partially offset by the addition of our Angamos plant with an adjusted PTC of $11 million, and also efficient reservoir management at Chivor in Columbia.","Despite the shortfalls of 2012, Andes is positioned for growth in 2013, driven by Chile. Campiche, or Ventanas IV, reached full load in February and should achieve commercial operations in the next few weeks. In addition, we expect to benefit from higher availability due to the maintenance performed in 2012. Going forward, Gener's contracts are aligned with its efficient generation capacity so it's less exposed to the volatility in spot prices.","On Slide 21, our Brazil SBU includes 2 generation companies and 2 utilities. In terms of generation, Tiet\u00ea has roughly 2,600 megawatts of hydro, and Uruguaiana has over 600 megawatts of gas-fired capacity. On the utility side, Eletropaulo and Sul distribute power to S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio Grande do Sul, respectively.","In 2012, adjusted PTC from Brazil declined $94 million with the largest impacts from the tariff reset at Eletropaulo and the depreciation of the real. We expect growth in '13 with the initial restart of operations at Uruguaiana and recovery at Eletropaulo.","Next, in MCAC on Slide 22, we have our generation businesses in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. A key driver for adjusted PTC growth of $82 million in '12 is our new contracted hydro plant, Changuinola in Panama, with an adjusted PTC increase of $80 million. We expect adjusted PTC from this SBU to modestly increase in 2013, reflecting the 5-year tariff reset Andres mentioned in El Salvador.","In EMEA on Slide 23, we primarily have our generation businesses in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Again, our new business, Maritza in Bulgaria, accounted for most of the growth with an adjusted PTC contribution of $90 million. Onetime arbitration settlement at Cartagena in Spain also drove some results, as did higher dispatch at Kilroot in the United Kingdom. In 2013, we expect a decline in this SBU due to the non-recurrence of the Cartagena transaction and the impact of the sale of the Ukraine utilities.","The Asia SBU on Slide 24 is primarily comprised of our 660-megawatt Masinloc facility in the Philippines, a 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong II project under construction in Vietnam, as well as modest contributions from our 420-megawatt OPGC plant in India. We recorded an adjusted PTC increase of $102 million, primarily due to higher demand and favorable spot prices at Masinloc.","At the end of last year, Masinloc entered into a 7-year contract, which effectively hedges 85% of its output. Contract includes a fuel pass-through, and the revenue is denominated in local currency as indexed to the U.S. dollar. It should reduce the volatility from selling in the spot market, but at somewhat lower prices. With the decline through our China asset sales, we therefore expect a reduction in adjusted PTC from Asia in 2013.","Going now to Slide 25. We've covered each of the SBUs, representing $2.1 billion of adjusted PTC. Offsetting this, we have corporate charges, including interest expense on our $6 billion of AES debt and most of our G&A expense. Year-over-year corporate charges increased slightly due to increased interest expense, which was partially offset by G&A reductions. In 2013, we expect a decline in interest expense as we continue to repay debt. In addition, through our SBUs, we're driving cost reductions as we achieve $145 million in annual savings by 2014.","After adjusting for corporate charges, our total AES adjusted PTC came in at $1.4 billion. Adjusted EPS benefited from lower share count as a result of our 2011 and 2012 share buybacks. However, our adjusted effective tax rate in 2012 was higher than in 2011. Importantly, the 2012 tax benefit applicable through the retroactive extension of the CFC look-through rule will be recorded in 2013 results, in line with the early January 2013 enactment date of the legislation. This benefit is about $0.015 for the first quarter of 2013.","Now turning to Slide 26. The trends in proportional free cash flow were similar for the year with the result of $1.2 billion, roughly 1\/3 increase over 2011. The U.S. SBU accounted for most of this increase due to DP&L's first year of contributions as well as improved operating performance and lower environmental effects at IPL. The Asia SBU also increased due to the strong performance at Masinloc. Offsetting these trends, cash flow from Brazil declined as a result of higher working capital requirements and the impact of the Eletropaulo tariff reset.","Turning to Slide 27, capital allocation. I'm pleased to report that we delivered on the capital allocation commitments we made last year. First, on the sources side, we collected $600 million of asset sales proceeds during the year. We also generated $500 million in parent free cash flow. During the year, 82% of our discretionary investments were allocated to debt repayment, share buybacks and dividends. In addition, we invested $195 million in our subsidiaries, which is $67 million less than we projected on our last call.","Now I'll address our 2013 guidance on Slide 28. We're narrowing our guidance to 3 metrics: adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow and consolidated net cash provided by operating activities. We believe adjusted EPS is the most useful indicator of the ongoing earnings power of the company. On the cash flow side, proportional free cash flow is the most relevant cash metric as it measures AES' ownership and operating cash flow after maintenance and environmental capital expenditures. Proportional free cash flow could be utilized for debt paydown, share repurchases, growth investments or other purposes at the subsidiaries and the parent. In addition, we're providing consolidated net cash provided by operating activities to reconcile with U.S. GAAP. We hope this simplifies our targets for investors.","In 2013, we're projecting an adjusted EPS range of $1.24 to $1.32 per share. I'd like to point out a couple of factors to consider when looking at this guidance. It includes about a $0.05 of dilution from the $500 million of potential asset sales that we're targeting this year, including the $113 million Ukraine sale which was already announced. Impact of specific transactions can obviously vary, but we thought it was appropriate to include an estimate in our guidance.","In addition, we've taken a closer look at the hydrology situation in Brazil, included a modest impact in this guidance range. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we do expect to show a year-over decline in the first quarter due to the $0.06 onetime benefit in Spain during the first quarter of last year. Therefore, we're anticipating earnings growth the rest of the year more weighted towards the second half of the year.","Bottom line, adjusted PTC at the SBU level is growing modestly, is offset by assumed asset sales. In terms of other EPS impacts, we expect a benefit of about $0.03 from the impact of our capital allocation efforts. In addition, we expect a lower effective tax rate this year as the CFC look-through rule was extended for '13. Further, our 2014 exposure to this rule is about $0.01 to $0.02.","For proportional free cash flow, we're forecasting a decline of $300 million, of which roughly $200 million is due to increased environmental CapEx at IPL and Gener. The decline is also driven by lower operating performance at DP&L and increased working capital requirements at Gener. We would expect this trend to reverse in 2014 and beyond as operating cash flow increases due to capacity additions and operational improvements.","Due to our parent capital allocation plan for 2013 on Slide 29, we had approximately $300 million in cash on hand at year end. The slide reflects proceeds from announced asset sales of about $180 million, primarily Ukraine. Again, we expect to see almost $400 million more in asset sales this year to reach our $500 million target that Andres referenced. But we won't add them to the plan on this page until specific transactions are announced. We additionally expect to generate approximately $400 million to $500 million of parent free cash flow. Therefore, based on announced transactions, we're projecting discretionary cash of roughly $1 billion to $1.1 billion. In terms of uses, we plan to use $350 million for debt reduction and about $200 million for investments in our subsidiaries. That leaves about $220 million to $370 million to be allocated later in the year. Our deployment of this cash will likely be a combination of debt repayment, growth investments and share buybacks. As Andres noted, we currently have $300 million of the share repurchase authorization fully available.","Finally, I'd like to briefly discuss our total return expectations for 2012 to 2015. We continue to be comfortable with the 6% to 8% expectations we discussed last quarter. This includes annual EPS growth of about 4% to 6% and a dividend yield of about 1% to 2%. The midpoint of our 2013 adjusted EPS guidance reflects about 3% growth, which is slightly below the 3-year trend, consistent with our communications last fall.","And the drivers of our earnings growth in this period is projects currently under construction, listed on Slide 30. Andres has addressed the returns from the platform expansion projects that will complete construction in time to contribute a full year of earnings in 2015. Collectively, we expect that these will add approximately $0.05 per share in 2015. Our Mong Duong project comes online in late 2015. In addition, Mong Duong will be subject to lease accounting, where cash returns are better than book income in the early years. We do expect significant cash distributions beginning in 2016 and throughout the life of the project with cash return in 2016 of about 19%.","In summary, we had a number of good achievements in '12 that provide a strong foundation for the future. We're very encouraged by the commitment of AES people to deliver value to our shareholders. And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Tom. Let me summarize our key messages on this call. Despite the significant headwinds we faced in 2012, we delivered 22% adjusted EPS growth and 33% higher proportional free cash flow. We are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives in 2013, and we'll continue executing on our strategy. To that end, we will continue to cut costs and improve the profitability of our portfolio, de-risk the company through deleveraging and narrowing our geographic and business focus through asset sales and allocate capital in a manner which maximizes shareholder value creation.","Before taking any questions, I would like to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day on Thursday, May 9, in New York. We look forward to seeing you there and in the coming weeks. Operator, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question does come from Jon Cohen of ISI Group.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. So the $400 million of targeted asset sales, have you identified yet what those might be? Or is that something that you want to talk about?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Sure, Jon. I would say that in the past, we have not given -- talked about specific assets until the deal is signed. And the reason for that, obviously, it affects the morale of the people or could also affect certain other things they're undergoing. So what I would say is that what we will be selling are those where we -- give priority to those where we have sort of one-off assets in a country or where we don't really see that we have a strong competitive advantage or the opportunity for profitable expansion. The other thing is that we will be looking at really the total cost of running those businesses. So in terms of is it a business that drives a lot of overhead here for the particular characteristics of that business. So I can't say much more than that but that we've been continuing to work on that. And two, what we will do will be very much aligned with our strategy, as we've outlined and as we've done to date. Now we're not going to do any sort of fire sales. I think we've been very judicious to make sure that we got the best value possible from these sales.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one other question. I was wondering if there's any way if you could frame for us the sort of swing factor in DPL based on what you filed and what the sort of status quo could be. So what's the sort of plus or minus in terms of EPS estimates in 2013 and beyond?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. As I said in my talk, we're in the midst of the filings right now. We also have intervenors. But I really can't give you any color at this stage beyond what I've already mentioned.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. And I also wanted to thank you, Tom, for these new disclosures. I think this is exactly what we needed. But the -- there's a placeholder for $200 million of additional investments in subsidiaries. I think in the past, I presume a lot of that is going to Chile and into the Gener expansions. You had talked about equity -- raising equity at the subsidiary level. How do you think about that just given where the AES stock is trading relative to Gener?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","That's a fair question, John. A lot of good work by the accounting team, the IR team and the people in the businesses to try to help our disclosures be more user-friendly. The $200 million that's on the chart, the capital allocation chart that I touched on, that does not include Gener. That's really spread out amongst a number of businesses. The -- I think 80% of it is in the top 5, little bits of telco. We do have an energy storage project that we expect to do but is not closed yet. And then we do have investment in Turkey. And probably the largest one is the Jordan project that started construction last year. That's about $60 million. So the $200 million is pieces of a number of things. With respect to Gener, Gener may do an equity offering. They would do that or may need to do that if they do both Cochrane and Alto Maipo and both of those close this year. Just the size of that, those 2 projects may have them do that. I should point out that Gener's not made any plans. They're still in consideration of doing that. I don't want to get too specific because they're a public company, and I don't want to front-run their own dialogue down in Chile with their public investors. That being said, to the extent they do an equity offering, our pro rata piece, which would be 71%, could be up to $200 million. It could be less than that, but our pro rata piece of that could be in the $150 million to $200 million range. So we'll essentially assess the value of us participating in that versus the -- versus our own stock. We're bullish on both stocks, so it's a relative bullishness analysis. Obviously, our stock trades cheap. At the same time, the Gener business has very good growth. So those are the kind of economic trade-offs, we'll say, that we'll go through. The only other thing I'd say is that we own 71%, and for some various governance issues, it's beneficial for us to stay above 2\/3. It's not a requirement, but there's some modest benefits. So we'll take that into consideration as we do our thinking.","Operator","Our next question does come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question here, just talking about Ohio, I suppose, how do you think about that business structurally beyond resolution of the ESP? I'm thinking '13, '14, '15. You've seen some of your peers in that state kind of reevaluate their ownership with merchant, et cetera. I know it may be too early to tell, but I kind of wanted to throw that out there.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, okay. What I would say is that there's not too much we can comment on. Maybe Andy can just talk a little bit of sort of the plans between generation and distribution down the road.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Andy Vesey. I think you're right. There's not much we can say because, clearly, we're in the middle of both settlement discussions and preparing for a potential case. What you do know and I think is quite clear is that we have made a commitment in our initial filing to putting forward a plan for the separation of our generation assets in 2017. That said, once we either get a settlement stipulation or we get a rate order and we can evaluate where we stand, we will be very focused on how we're going to operate going forward. As you'll remember and I think we've said many times before, we sort of have 3 levers with Ohio. One is the -- having the right regulatory outcome, which we're close to being at the end of that. Second is making sure that we build our retail capabilities so that we can efficiently place our generation. I think we are doing that. And the third really is, once we see where we land, to make sure that we're optimizing around cost. And we'll be examining that once we get the outcome of the settlement or the case.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then if you could talk, broadly speaking, just timing on expense of settlement, like what window specifically here could we be talking to?","Andrew Martin Vesey","I'm having trouble hearing the question. Were you asking about...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","As to the Ohio ESP, what kind of timeline are we thinking about here for a fully litigated case versus a settlement? Just...","Andrew Martin Vesey","Yes, a couple of things or comments about -- let me say that actually today, we're actually having a settlement meeting that's ongoing today. But regardless, the current procedural schedule of March 1, this Friday, intervenor testimony is due. We've actually put that back 4 days from the original schedule to give more time for settlement. The same with staff testimony, which is due on the 8th of March. The evidentiary hearing remains scheduled for the 11th. Now depending on where we go, if we have a stipulation to deliver by the 11th, then we could see a decision as early as the first half of May. If we go through a fully -- the full case, then we're really looking about most likely concluding the hearings by the middle of April and looking for a decision in the late June, early July time frame. By statute, the commission is required to make a ruling on a filed case 275 days after its filing. So we would be seeing a ruling by the commission on the case no later than July 6.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then, Tom, going back to the financials here, if you will, when you talk about debt paydown, and you talk about a minimum level that you described in the slide deck, how do you think -- how do you weigh moving forward with the authorization that you've laid out today versus increments of debt paydown, and particularly as that relates to asset sales in '13?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, it's a balance. I think the minimum debt paydown that we have on that slide was really reflecting what we thought was reasonable to continue a steady improvement in our credit profile. So that -- based on our business outlook, we thought that was reasonable. In terms of going forward, we will look at -- first, as we sell assets, we do need to consider debt paydown as part of that. Obviously, some of the assets, or really all the assets, generate cash. So to the extent -- if you were to sell an asset and not pay down debt, then that would be credit dilutive. So as a base case, we tend to look at things as a starting point on a credit-neutral basis, i.e. what's the cash flow they generate, what's the debt you should pay down to be credit neutral without that asset. That doesn't say that's the rule where you end up, but that's at least a starting point. That does, though, leave you with what we believe is still meaningful cash. And we will look at that maybe consistent with a question I got earlier on share repurchase versus investment in Gener, I mean, those are the things that we look at in terms of valuation of the stock, in terms of what the attractiveness on a risk-adjusted basis is of the investment, be it in a subsidiary or be it in a new asset. Now kind of bottom line, I think we have room for all of them. Especially if we load on more asset sales, I think we have room for increasing the debt paydown, increasing the growth investments above $200 million if they meet the standards of being a good investment and also being able to implement some of our share repurchase.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And just to be clear about this, when you think about asset sales and break down, would you roughly think 50-50 -- a 50-50 split between debt paydown and equity? That's fair?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes. No, that's a fair approximation.","Operator","Our next question does come from Ali Agha from SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Andres, perhaps firstly for you. The -- just to be clear, you had mentioned, I think, that there was, I think, about $0.03 of accretion you assumed in your '13 guidance from capital allocation. I want to be clear, is that all assuming debt reduction? Or are you assuming any share buyback in your '13 guidance?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","It's really -- Ali, it's really a function of what we've done as well as what we'd expect to do. But it's frankly more a function of what we did in '11 and how that's already hitting us from the start of the year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So no share buyback incremental out of the $300 million is assumed in your EPS range. Is that fair?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, we do assume some capital allocation. So we -- yes, we assume, as we get cash, we're not going to put it in the mattress. So we do assume some balance of -- that the cash is earning, either from paying down debt, some share repurchase and\/or investments. I would say it's a -- that if we do share repurchase, it will be more back-end loaded as our cash -- some of the cash distributions we get tend to be more back-end loaded. And, obviously, to the extent we're getting things with asset sales, those would close and cash coming in the door more in the latter part of the year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Andres, the news flow coming out of Brazil has generally been negative for the last several months, apart from obviously the hydro, but just the government statements, the President's positions and statements. Now you guys have been clear that your concessions are not impacted. Just in the sense of impacting the valuation of your holdings and, hence, your own stock price, clearly every time something comes out of Brazil, it takes -- your stock takes a hit here. I'm just wondering, are you really looking at Brazil? I mean, what's your view right now on Brazil under the current administration? And is it a bit less attractive perhaps now given what we're hearing out there?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, yes. I think that -- put it this way. First, if you think of what we've done in terms of portfolio management in Brazil, we have sold a significant portion of our holdings in Eletropaulo. We started in 2006. We spun off to telecom. So if you look at our holdings today in Brazil, the 2 largest components are, quite frankly, first, Tiet\u00ea, and the second one is Sul, actually. We have a larger value, we believe, in Sul than we do in Eletropaulo. But we do get a lot of, let's say -- we have to react a lot to the news in Eletropaulo because it's a large publicly listed company. And of course, we are trying to maximize the value for all shareholders, including those of, of course, of Eletropaulo shareholders. But having said that, I think that in Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of contracted hydro. We have a challenge in terms of what we do past 2015. We're working on a commercial strategy there. We also had the opportunity, for example, of restarting Uruguaiana, and we've done that successfully. Now what we have to have is a permanent solution. So I do think there are opportunities for us in Brazil. I think of Brazil -- if you think over the medium term, it's going to be a growth market. And again, I think we're well positioned. Now again, I -- if I think back, I think our strategy of focusing more on Tiet\u00ea and trying to grow generation and reducing our position in Eletropaulo, for various reasons, was the correct one.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And last question. You seem to be on track for the 4% to 6% EPS growth you're now highlighting in '12 through '15 -- or '13 through '15. You've also said in the past that your goal would be to get you back to the 6% to 8% that you had previously been targeting. How confident are you of perhaps getting to that higher level? And where -- I mean, what would drive you to that higher level? What -- I mean, new projects that are not there? I mean, how would you get from the 4% to 6% to 6% to 8% if indeed that is still an aspiration?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, certainly, we're going to work very hard, as we've said in the past, to get back to the 6% to 8% growth. What are our levers? Well, some that I can talk about right now are we continue to have the cost cuts, we continue to have the efficiencies of a simplified portfolio. And that includes also better use of our synergies. And we also have our own sort of internal Six Sigma light APEX Programs, which are also contributing a lot. So I feel -- on the operational side, I feel that we're doing a good job, and that will add additional profitability into the future. The second, if you noticed when I talked about platform expansions, our new investment, we are basically expanding from our existing platform that takes less time. They have higher returns and especially risk-adjusted returns. So again, we feel very good about what we're going to do going forward. However, we feel also that in terms of the guidance that we are committing to today, we're staying on that 4% to 6% rather than the 6% to 8%. But we're going to really push to get there.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","These things you talk about in expansions and maybe cost reductions, these are things that could actually help you in the '13 through '15 period? Or are you really talking about longer term beyond '15?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, it depends. I think when we're talking about the efficiency of the overall portfolio, it includes our G&A and it also includes our cost of goods sold, those are immediate. So -- and it depends on the type of extension we're doing to the platform. If it's a 20-megawatt battery storage, that's going to impact in 18 months. On the other hand, if it's building a significant addition to a new plant, well, that's more sort of in the '16, '17 framework. But realize we do have things like IPL's environmental CapEx, where we do get a tracker, and that's also short term. So it's a mix of things. And as we've said, we're going to -- we really feel that we're hitting on all cylinders in terms of looking at all the levers that we do have to fulfill our commitments.","Operator","Our next question does come from Charles Fishman of Morningstar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Argentina, what got the additional gas there? What is it more supply? Was it better hydro conditions? What changed?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, we've been doing a number of restructurings at Uruguaiana in terms of the contracts that it had over the past couple of years. But the main driver right now was the poor hydrology that they had was in Brazil, which made it more of interest to get the plant up and running. So we've had the plant up and running now. But as part of this, we are working on a long-term solution to get -- receive capacity payments at Uruguaiana. And we -- again, we think we're well positioned. Again, we took advantage of our presence in both countries and our relationships in both countries to get this. So the -- what we really came up with was a win-win-win solution, which is win for Argentina, win for the Brazilian electricity sector and a win for us and BNDES and Uruguaiana.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So what I think I just heard is it was more -- it was also due to getting a better energy and capacity price, as well as the gas being available.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Again, it was partly driven by the situation that -- we took advantage of the drought situation in Brazil. I don't know, Andy, do you want to add something to that?","Andrew Martin Vesey","Yes, just for clarity, there hasn't been a change in the gas situation in Argentina. This was an initiative between the Brazilian Government and the Argentinian Government to sort a near-term problem that Brazil was having from the drought. This is Brazilian gas being injected. It's LNG that's coming into Argentina. It belongs to Petrobras, the Brazilian company, and what the Argentinians are doing are facilitating its transmission. They're regassing it, and they're sending it to Uruguaiana. So this is Brazilian gas using the regas and distribution and transmission network within Argentina. That's really the answer to the question that you asked. This is not Argentinian gas, this is Brazilian gas. And then...","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then the 650-megawatt CCGT in Indiana that you were talking about, would 100% of that be regulated and under IPL?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Masinloc, the second unit you mentioned there that you potentially start on, would you look to get a PPA before you began construction on that based on the fact you just signed a 7-year hedge on that one?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, yes. If you look at most -- almost all of our project, I mean, we're not building, with the exception of Turkey, any sort of merchant projects. And that's just the characteristics of the Turkish market. But other than that, all of our projects have PPAs, and we do require very high levels of contracting before we start on a project.","Operator","Our next question does come from Maura Shaughnessy of MFS Investment Management.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","A couple of questions. First, just on the IPL situation. In terms of the environmental spend, the $500 million fix-up and the combined-cycle plant that was just discussed, what is the -- you mentioned that the environmental filing looks to be done by the second quarter. Are these 2 discrete filings? Is -- what's the process in Indiana from...","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","These are discrete and separate.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","And so when should we hear about the plant?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Andy, do you want to give the details?","Andrew Martin Vesey","Sure, Maura. It's Andy Vesey. Right now, it's still a process, and the process within Indiana requires us essentially to go after a sort of an all-source competitive bid, who can give us the least-cost solution. One of those is our own option that we're contributing, which is this combined-cycle self-build. There are a number of others. All those are under review right now. We will be providing a testimony in the first half of '13 going along with our filing of the CPNC (sic) [CPCN]. So that's the new generation piece. But the typical process is you file an application for a certificate of public convenience and need, and once that's approved, you go ahead because that's our certificate that requires that whatever cost we are incurring, we're going to be allowed to recover under a regulatory process. So for maximum...","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","Okay, great. It's integrated?","Andrew Martin Vesey","Yes.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","And so remind me again what IPL is earning on a regulated basis that both the environmental piece and potentially the gas plant would earn today if they were approved?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, Maura, it's Tom. In the immediate set-up, with -- the MATS is -- would be a part of a tracker. So you get immediate recovery on it, and the CC [ph] would be more traditional. The IPL current ROE is a product of a settlement that's less than 10 years old. And it was...","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","Right. So it's more the black box?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, it's a package deal, exactly.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","Okay. So we don't need to discuss that, right?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Right. So that would be -- the tracker does have a return consistent with that package deal or black box, as you say. The new plant, if approved, would then ultimately be subject to a rate proceeding closer or at the time when it went in service. So that's out a number of years. And that would then be at -- ROE is consistent with Indiana practice at that time. So you probably can see some of the standards. I'd be cautious about pointing to a specific precedent, but it would be generally consistent with Indiana ROEs at that time.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","Okay. Let me jump to Brazil. So we sort of had the hydrology freak show, November, December, January. I guess spot prices averaged in the 400s in January, and February in the 200s. So things have chilled out a little bit. But as I understand it, the government is trying to potentially continue to run some amount of thermal throughout the year, which, given the amount of hydrology base, it probably makes some sense. So I was just wondering, is there a chance that this deal with Petrobras via the Argentinians gets extended? Or your -- or the hope is that you get this one-off capacity payment, which -- yes, so I'm just trying to understand that.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Sure, Maura. I'll say first, it is your right. I think the government, until the reservoir levels reach higher levels, I think they're at 37% of capacity, they will run -- continue to sort of force more thermal production. In terms of Uruguaiana specifically, our intent here is to really have a long-term solution. And as Andy mentioned, what we're really doing is tolling the gas through Argentina because that's where the pipeline reaches, so right now, it's -- Petrobras is delivering the LNG at Bahia Blanca, but then we have other options going forward. So what we really want is to have a long-term solution there, and we're working on that. And so we would have options to where to source the gas where the Argentinians would get its a tolling agreement and the Brazilians would get the additional capacity. So that really is the sort of long-term solution. So there is a short-term component, which is the current hydrological conditions which facilitated this. Then there's a secondary component, which is having a long-term solution to Uruguaiana. We're working on that. We aren't in a situation to announce that yet.","Maura A. Shaughnessy - MFS Investment Management, Inc.","And so in terms of at least for February and March, do I assume that Uruguaiana, however you say that, is being sold at spot prices, since you hadn't obviously contracted on that since it hadn't been operated for a while? Is that a fair...","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","No, no. We're not making the spot margins on Uruguaiana. We are basically getting capacity payments on it.","Operator","Yes, our last question does come from Brian Chin from Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just with regards to the situation down in Southern California and the [indiscernible] situation, can you just get us a little bit more up to speed on what's going on with Southland? A lot of headlines between yourselves, Edison, JPMorgan. I just want to make sure we understand where we're at on that.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay, I would say, first, some of the headlines are that we're trying to get the plant expansions permitted. We have a unique footprint there, and we believe that they will have to be repowering up those plants sometime over the next 10 years and that nobody is going to be able to permit new plants. So those locations are very valuable and very critical for its stability. The second part of your question has to do with JPMorgan, right, and the tolling agreement. I don't know how much we can say there.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, no, I'd just say there is a smaller project, a synchronous condenser project that we're trying to put in place for the summer that would be quite constructive to the area and provide some good stability and some additional power. We're working through some waivers in process with our toller. And also, the [indiscernible] is also involved in that dialogue. I believe those discussions have been going quite constructively. So we're hopeful that we can get that all tied up and then get our synchronous condenser project operating this summer.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And then lastly, just latest thoughts on timing of when you're going to revisit the dividend again.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I would say that, again, as we get more results under our belt, we will look at it periodically. I don't really want to commit to anything at this point in time.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","With that, I'd like to take -- I'd like to turn the call back to Ahmed.","Ahmed Pasha","Okay, we thank everyone for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you. Today's conference has ended.

I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ahmed Pasha, Head of Investor Relations.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Effie. Good morning, and welcome to the first quarter 2012 earnings call of The AES Corporation. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. They are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me today this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Victoria Harker, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings call. Since our last earnings call in February, we have continued to meet with many of our investors as we visited Baltimore, New York and London. We had some great meetings, and I appreciate the direct feedback on our plans and strategy.","Today, I would like to highlight some of the progress that we've made since our fourth quarter call. First, we're off to a good start with our first quarter results. And despite some headwinds, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. Second, we're encouraged with the progress we are making at DP&L, including their market rate option filing and the likelihood of reaching a constructive outcome in a timely manner. Third, we have closed 2 more asset sales, Red Oak and Ironwood, for a total of $227 million in proceeds to AES. We have also signed an agreement to sell our interest in 379 megawatts of hydro assets in China subject to customary approvals. This represents additional equity proceeds of approximately $48 million. And fourth, we remain committed to using a balanced approach to capital allocation in order to deliver on our 2013 to 2015 total return goals. To that end, we have increased our current share repurchase authorization by $180 million, so we now have authorization of $302 million. ","Now turning to our first quarter 2012 financial results. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we reported $0.37 in adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter, a 54% increase over the first quarter of last year. Similarly, our proportional free cash flow grew 51% during the first quarter. Victoria will discuss the drivers of our performance in more detail, but I am pleased with our results, which puts us in a strong position for the year. We delivered this healthy performance despite having had an extremely mild winter in the U.S., one of the warmest in recent history, which affected us doubly through low natural gas and energy prices, as well as lower demand.","The second topic I'd like to address is DP&L. During the first quarter, we continued with our plans to integrate DP&L with the rest of AES' portfolio. We named the new President and CEO of DP&L, Phil Harrington. Phil has more than 20 years of industry experience, which includes managing a competitive power business. His experience and skills are well suited for today's dynamic Ohio marketplace.","At DP&L, our focus is threefold: Obtaining a constructive outcome in the rate proceedings for 2013, executing on our retail strategy and achieving operating efficiencies as a business.","As you may recall, DP&L's current generation rate expired in December of 2012. To establish the tariff for 2013 and beyond, DP&L filed a market rate option or MRO with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio at the end of March. Under the proposed terms of the MRO, DP&L will transition customers to market prices for generation over the next 5 years. We are working closely with the Ohio commission, customers and other interested parties to arrive at a constructive outcome for all stakeholders in a timely manner.","The staff's comments were issued last Friday, and they were very productive. We are where we expected to be at this stage of the process.","The team at DP&L is also focused on enhancing their retail capabilities. Customer switching trends at DP&L for the first quarter of 2012 were in line with our guidance for the year as 3% of the load switched during the quarter. As of the end of March, 53% of the total retail load had switched to ultimate suppliers, but DP&L's retail arm was able to capture 78% of those switched loads. The reduction in DP&L's gross margin in the quarter as a result of customers switching is approximately $27 million, up $18 million from the first quarter of 2011. DP&L's retail arm is now not only aggressively working to retain customers in its service territory but it is also branching out to attract new customers in Illinois and other areas of Ohio. DP&L's retail subsidiary, MC Squared, recently won a competitive bid auction to supply several North Shore, Illinois communities with electricity for up to 3 years.","We are also taking a careful look at ways to improve our operating margins at DP&L and our North American portfolio in general. Due to current low natural gas prices, the near-term outlook for DP&L is challenging and admittedly disappointing relative to our expectations at the time we announced the acquisition. However, forecast for DP&L are still within our guidance range for this year and consistent with our earnings growth rate targets for 2013 to 2015.","Thirdly, I'd like to update you on our asset sales program. We continue to make good progress on narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling select, nonstrategic businesses. Since our last call, we closed the sales of our Ironwood and Red Oak plants for a total of $227 million. In addition, today, we announced that we signed an agreement to sell 100% of our interest in the 379-megawatt small hydro assets in China. On a proportional basis, we will sell 72 megawatts. Proceeds are expected to be approximately $48 million, and we believe this transaction will close in the second half of 2012. Including the transaction announced today, we have closed and signed asset sales totaling $804 million, about 40% of the potential $2 billion universe of nonstrategic assets that could be sold. The average P\/E multiple realized on these sales was more than 20x 2011 adjusted earnings. These sales have also led to the deconsolidation of $1.7 billion of non-recourse debt from our balance sheet.","Finally, as we laid out in our fourth quarter earnings call, we're executing a balanced approach to capital allocation, which aims to balance strong total shareholder returns with profitable growth.","Now let me review the primary sources of available cash that we will allocate this year. In addition to our asset-sale proceeds, we expect to generate approximately $600 million of parent free cash flow. This will bring our total net discretionary cash for the year to approximately $1.3 billion.","Now let me lay out how we plan to use our available cash. We intend to use approximately 2\/3 or $920 million to delever the company and buy back stock. To date, we have already paid down $197 million of expensive non-recourse debt in Brazil, and we have used another $285 million to repay borrowings on our corporate revolver, which we drew on to fund the acquisition of DP&L. As I mentioned previously, our Board of Directors has increased the outstanding authorization for share buybacks from $122 million to $302 million. We have not repurchased any shares since the fourth quarter of 2011 because we used our liquidity to fund the acquisition of DP&L and then, in the first quarter, to pay down associated borrowings under the revolver. Nonetheless, at current prices, we see share buybacks as a value accretive investment. In addition, starting in Q4, we will be paying a $30 million quarterly dividend. With respect to the remaining 1\/3 of our discretionary free cash or approximately $360 million, we intend to utilize the sum to grow our portfolio or to further invest in our balance sheet. ","Before making any final determination, we will apply the capital allocation framework we discussed in our last call with the goal of maximizing risk-adjusted total returns for our shareholders. To that end, we will provide you with an update on our capital allocation plan as we make progress on asset sales and realize the free cash flow being generated by our existing businesses.","Now let me provide you with an update on our development projects. We are only proceeding with those projects that meet our investment criteria in markets where we believe we have a compelling, competitive advantage. We are giving preference to those projects that expand upon existing platforms and use pools of local liquidity, either debt or cash. Our goal is to significantly improve on our overall capital efficiency and return on invested capital.","In Chile, we are making good progress on our 2 most advanced development projects, Cochrane and Alto Maipo. Cochrane is a 532-megawatt coal-fired plant adjacent to our newly commissioned and successful Angamos project in the northern grid. And Alto Maipo is a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro plant near the load center in Santiago. Alto Maipo is an expansion of our existing 209 Alfalfal run of the river hydro facility. We have already received a number of critical milestones on both projects, including securing the necessary environmental permits. We are currently working on the power offtake agreement, construction contracts and financing. Given our large position in Chile, we expect the equity needs of the 2 projects to be -- or supplied through the local Chilean market or through cash being generated at the AES Gener level. ","We're also making good progress in the Philippines, where we had a 630-megawatt coal-fired expansion project adjacent to our existing 660-megawatt Masinloc facility. Recently, the Philippine government approved this project for various investment incentives, such as an income tax holiday. The project team is now focused on offtake agreements, EPC contracts and non-recourse financing with the view to close in 2013.","In India, where we have strap cash in our joint venture with the state government of Orissa, we are making progress in deploying that cash towards a tripling of capacity at our OPGC facility. ","Our initial equity contributions to the platform expansions in India and the Philippines are unlikely to occur before 2013 as the projects can self-fund early stage development activities.","In addition to these platform expansion projects, we're making steady progress on building on our wind development pipeline in Poland and the U.K. and the development of 2 thermal projects, one in Colombia via Chivor, a 1000-megawatt hydro owned by AES Gener, and one in Turkey via our joint venture with  Ko\u00e7. We're also moving forward with smaller but highly profitable platform expansions, like a 20-megawatt lithium ion battery facility related to the Angamos facility in Chile, to Ingetec [ph] , a 20-megawatt expansion of our hydro plant at Chivor in Colombia, and closing our open cycle Los Mina gas plant in the Dominican Republic. We expect our equity investments in all of these projects in 2012 to be modest. ","Our larger construction projects are also progressing well. In Chile, we expect the 270-megawatt coal-fired Campiche plant to be commissioned in early 2013. And in Vietnam, our 1,200-megawatt coal-fired Mong Duong plant remains on track for commissioning in 2015.","Overall, I am pleased with the growth prospects that we have across our portfolio. We have not seen any negative effects from our reduction in business development expenditures. Our greater focus on platform expansions has lowered development cost and is yielding projects with higher average returns and greater capital efficiency, which we define as net present value over AES equity investment. Even so, in all cases, the value created by development projects must beat the value creation opportunity we have through share buybacks and debt repayment. As I mentioned on the last quarterly call, we will implement our capital allocation framework with the goal of achieving an average 3-year total return of 8% to 10% from 2013 through 2015.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Victoria to discuss our strong results in the first quarter in greater detail.","Victoria D. Harker","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the following topics: our first quarter results in key drivers of growth margins; earnings per share; cash from operations and free cash flow; parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.","First, let's review our financial results for the quarter. Our proportional gross margin increased by $172 million compared to the first quarter of 2011. This was driven by the contributions of our new businesses, including Dayton Power & Light in the U.S., Maritza in Bulgaria, Angamos in Chile and Changuinola in Panama, as well as strong volume growth in Latin America. In addition, gross margin benefited from settlement of several prior period claims at Cartagena in Spain. These disputes were resolved earlier this quarter, allowing us to record a proportional pretax benefit of approximately $67 million.","However, we also experienced some headwinds during the quarter. At AES Gener, lower spot pricing reduced margins in the SING in the Northern part of Chile. This is a significant trend we're experiencing this year, which I will cover in more detail when I discuss our full year 2012 guidance expectations. Beyond this, as many of you know, the tariff reset process for Eletropaulo in Brazil is still underway. However, on April 19, the regulator there issued a preliminary tariff proposal, which is lower than previously expected.","To reflect our updated projections of the tariff reset outcome on AES, we increased our pretax regulatory liability to $162 million for the quarter, which includes a catch-up liability of $29 million for the second half of 2011. Relative to our previous expectations, this equates to an incremental ongoing $5 million impact to proportional gross margin per quarter as AES owns 16% of Eletropaulo.","Turning to adjusted earnings per share. First quarter results increased by $0.13 to $0.37. The new businesses contributed $0.06 during the quarter, and higher volumes in Latin America added $0.05. Lower prices primarily related to the tariff reset expectation in Eletropaulo in Brazil and spot prices in Chile reduced earnings per share by $0.04. Beyond this, outages at our plants in Northern Ireland and Panama impacted the quarter by $0.02. Repairs in those locations are nearing completion, and most of those plants will be back online later this quarter. In addition, our Esti plant in Panama is also scheduled to the back online early in the second half of 2012. Finally, the settlement at Cartagena added $0.06 for the quarter. In total, the trends affecting gross margin added $0.11. Lower G&A cost and other factors contributed $0.02 in the quarter compared to the same quarter last year. When compared to a year earlier, diluted or GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations increased $0.14 to $0.44 for the quarter, driven by an increase in gross margin and a gain on the sale of Cartagena, but offset by impairment losses, which are excluded from adjusted earnings per share.","Now turning to cash flow. The same operating trends also drove our cash flow performance for the quarter. We recorded year-over-year gains on both a consolidated and a proportional basis. On a consolidated basis, our net cash from operating activities increased 6% year-over-year. Our proportional free cash flow increased 51% to $235 million for the quarter. ","These positive cash flow trends also benefited parent liquidity during the quarter. Not only did we generate $229 million from the close of the sale of our business in Cartagena in Spain, but we also realized $176 million in subsidiary distributions from ongoing operation. Finally, as Andres mentioned, we repaid $285 million of borrowings under our corporate revolver that have been previously drawn during our acquisition of DP&L in late 2011. As a result, we ended the first quarter with more than $900 million of parent liquidity, up from $693 million at year end 2011, significantly strengthening the parent balance sheet.","In summary, we report a strong quarter across most financial metrics. Further, we're on track with our cost-cutting initiatives as we expect to achieve $50 million of savings in 2012 and cumulative cost savings of $100 million by the end of 2013. With all of these levers in hand, we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments in 2012 and beyond.","Now let me give you an update on our 2012 guidance. We are reaffirming our full year guidance for adjusted earnings per share and all cash flow metrics based on the trends we currently see. However, we are lowering U.S. GAAP earnings per share guidance at this time from a range of $1.28 to $1.36 to $1.22 to $1.30, reflecting the $0.06 of noncash impairment recorded during the quarter.","Now let me discuss trends impacting our guidance metrics in greater detail. Since our last call, there have been both positive and negative developments that have had an impact on our 2012 forecast.","Starting with our earnings per share. As I mentioned earlier, relative to our budget, we experienced a decline in spot market pricing in Chile during the quarter. Lower spot prices in Northern Chile were primarily driven by the temporary market pricing impacts of fuel supply dynamics at competitor plants. AES Gener's exposure to lower spot prices in Northern Chile reduced adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.04. However, in June, contracted capacity at AES Gener's new Angamos facility will increase from 65% to 90%. So the exposure to this market pricing factor will be reduced during the second half of the year. ","In addition, the Eletropaulo tariff reset is still pending, and it's expected to be finalized by June of this year. Relative to our previous 2012 guidance, we now have to absorb a $0.02 reduction in adjusted earnings per share, consistent with our Q1 regulatory liability accruals. We will, of course, update you once this important tariff change is finalized.","Another factor affecting our 2012 operational outlook is the loss of earnings from the Red Oak and Ironwood plans due to their sale, which is approximately $0.01. As these asset sales are now closed, we have reflected this in our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range.","On a positive side, since December 2011, foreign exchange and commodity price forward curves have moved in our favor. We've updated our guidance to reflect the forward curves as of March 31, 2012. This resulted in a positive impact of $0.06 in adjusted earnings per share. Finally, we're projecting a $0.01 benefit from investing our discretionary cash in planned debt paydown and share repurchases in the second half of 2012. ","Further, as previously noted on our last call, our adjusted earnings per share guidance assumes the extension of the U.S. income tax deferral benefits originally enacted under TIPRA. This is reflected in an effective tax rate for 2012, which remains generally in line with our 29% tax rate for 2011. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year, but it has not as yet been passed. As a result, we've been hard at work this quarter developing tax mitigation strategies to reduce the full year estimated earnings impact from approximately $0.12 to $0.02 to $0.03 this year should TIPRA not be extended before year end. Recall that this is a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss balance of approximately $2.1 billion.","Considering all of these factors, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 for 2012. ","In terms of our cash flow guidance, we expect 2012 to come in near the lower end of our range for both consolidated and proportional measures. This is largely due to higher working capital requirements in Brazil, higher environmental CapEx anticipated at AES Gener, as well as the loss of cash flow from asset sales.","Note that our current guidance includes only the impacts of asset sales that have closed as of April 2012, including Red Oak and Ironwood. We have not yet included the impact of our China asset sale in our guidance, but we expect it to be minimal as this business was not expected to be a significant contributor to our 2012 financials.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Thanks, Victoria. In closing, we are executing on our commitments to our shareholders. A strong first quarter puts us on track for our 2012 target. We continue to sign and close asset sales, and we are achieving good valuations for shareholders while we simplify and streamline our operations. We are well on our way to achieve $50 million in cost reductions for this year and a total of $100 million by the end of next year. We have increased our authorization for share buybacks to $302 million and remain committed to an average 3-year total return of 8% to 10% from 2013 through 2015.","I look forward to continuing our dialogue with investors and analysts, and we will be providing timely update on our progress. ","Operator, we will now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question here, if I heard you right, Victoria, you mentioned a reduction in the TIPRA impact. I would just be curious, what happened there to drive that?","Victoria D. Harker","Without going into a huge amount of detail on the call, we effectively looked at a number of the countries that generate the TIPRA related tax impacts for us and we have looked at changing some of the treatment relative to that from a reporting standpoint. It's not recurring in terms of the benefit, but we do believe if we don't get the extension, we can effectuate that in year, taking the impact from $0.12 to about $0.02 to $0.03.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And on the DPL side, the first question, MRO versus ESP. It seems like the staff or PUCO Bradley wanted to -- seems to desire an ESP. Can you still settle the case even though you have an MRO in front of you? And how would that work just kind of logistically?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Julien, I'd like Andy to answer that.","Andrew Martin Vesey","It's Andrew Vesey. As you know, we did file the MRO because we believe that it was the best way to get a good consolidation of a lot of the interest that our MRO will deliver lower tariff rate to our tariff customers over time, including in 2013. It lines with the statutes in Ohio and advances the public policy to its competition. And for us, it really protects the financial integrity of the company and, importantly, allows us to emerge in this transition period as a viable competitor in the market. That said, the staff comments basically had indicated that they believe we could get all those outcomes with an ESP and, in fact, advised that we consider. And I think the words in their comments were strongly advised that we consider it because it had more advantages to us. But we're entering the technical conference -- the pre-conference hearings next week. We've had a very open engagement with interveners and with staff. I think our view is that there's enough commonality of interest that settlement is a possibility. And my sense is that as we move towards the evidentiary hearing in June, probably the best time to find some common ground. So we are open to the comments. We're open to proposals. Our view is that if we were to consider moving forward from an MRO to an ESP, we would only do so if it gave us the same benefits as the MRO does. And if the staff is correct that there are greater advantages, we surely would consider heading down the road of a settlement. And our view is that the settlement could be done in a timely way within the schedule laid out by the commission. So I think that's the way we're seeing it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then looking at the SG&A and integration of DP&L, just on the cost front, clearly executing on that, but for the balance of the year and as you look into 2013, how does that kind of pan out for you guys? Maybe Victoria?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Go ahead, Andy.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Julien, it's Andy again. When we announced the acquisition, I think we said that we were looking to up -- somewhere around $40 million over time for that. We're making progress. I have to say since November, since we've got it, we've done a lot of work looking at all the cost, analyzing the opportunities and we've started to pull up some synergies. I think what will be helpful to us as we get through the case and we see how we come out, it will give us a better sense of the platform that we'll have and we're going to drive. My view is that within the next 2 years, we'll make substantial progress on that. As Andres had said, the approach at DP&L is 3-pronged and they're almost in series. The first thing we have to do is we have to get the case completed. We have clarity in a lot of the issues. At the same time, the next thing is to really continue to drive on the regulatory strategy. We've made a lot of changes. Adding Phil Harrington is a very important step for us with his competitive experience. We've integrated MC Squared into the retail function broadly at DP&L. We're doing a lot of operational sharing between our other businesses. And that will lead us then to such really drive cost out for 2 reasons: One is because I think across the business, we should do that. We have the capability at AES to do that. But secondly, because it will make us the much more able competitor in the marketplace. The answer to your question, I think we're on track with the synergy as we're looking at them and they will materialize over the next 24 to 36 months.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","And Julien, as we said, really looking at it from a portfolio point of view, so a dollar saved is a dollar saved regardless of where it comes from. So we really want to bring -- to bear our synergies, economies of scale and operating know-how, but we really think of it from a portfolio point of view.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And just a quick last one here, Argentina, there have been some clear news events about nationalization, just first, with regards to any read-throughs. And secondly, from a distribution perspective, the expectation had been fairly minimal regardless, right?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Yes. I mean, first -- regarding Argentina, we have good relations with the government. We've done a number of high profile projects, such as burning biodiesel, the president came to see it, and the CCGT, and certain other high tech. We have exited our distribution businesses, which is the most regulated. As you know, we sold 3 distribution businesses over time. So I think our situation is different from that of a YDF [ph], which has caused a lot of the news and had some particular circumstances around it. Now regarding the importance of Argentina to our portfolio, from the distribution from Argentina this year of $25 million and to put that in perspective, that's about 2% of our total. So we don't expect the material impact of any possible developments in Argentina. But as I said, we have a very productive relationship with the government.","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays Capital.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering if you could hit TIPRA again just in terms of the offsets that you found, sort of what happens to the potential offsets if TIPRA is extended? Would you use those in later years? Or -- and I think you also said it was a onetime benefit, if I heard you right?","Victoria D. Harker","Yes, and I think we can -- it's probably not worth going through a huge amount of detail on this call, but it's relative to our tax filings relative to those particular countries that tend to generate the income for us that are TIPRA related in terms of the tax effects. So once we move down the path of doing that, it's not a duplicative set of benefits that we get if the TIPRA legislation is enacted later this year, but it's -- we don't have it on a recurring basis. It just would occur this year. And again, it would take a full year impact to about $0.02 to $0.03 from about $0.12 that we had anticipated before.","Ahmed Pasha","I think -- this is Ahmed. I mean, these are tax strategies, Gregg, I mean, that our tax group has implemented and they always do that. I mean, this is a tax planning at the end of the day that has helped us to write $0.06 to $0.07 in potential impact.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Well, I think it's important. I mean, we expect TIPRA to be extended. And what we're doing in no way affects sort of the -- it does get extended. There's nothing that we have lost as a result of these actions. We do realize that if it weren't to be extended, we could change the way we upstream cash from these big businesses in -- mainly the big businesses in Chile and Brazil as a result of this. But it's -- as I said, we said from the very beginning that we expected it to be extended. And we also said that we were working on offsetting strategy if just in case it wasn't extended. So we're fulfilling, I think, exactly what we said and we still think it's going to be extended just like it was in 2010.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, that's good to find. In terms of the buyback, if you could, Andres, just kind of clarify what you were saying there about coming back to us on capital allocation later in the year. I wasn't sure if you were meaning to say that you weren't going to be buying back stock in the quarter for one reason or another because the cash wasn't available.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","No, not at all. What I said is that -- as you know, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we're quite aggressive on our buybacks. We did not do any buybacks in the first quarter of this year. And the reason for that, as we said, is that we had to complete the acquisition of DP&L and then we wanted to pay the outstanding balances on our revolver. Going forward, as I said, we believe that at these prices, it's good value for us to do buybacks. What I did mention there is that all of the available cash that I had mentioned, the $1.3 billion, is not included in the additional asset sales. I think if we do additional asset sales and as we see the new projects progress, that 1\/3 of the total amount, which is approximately $360 million without additional asset sales, they will be coming back and giving a greater clarity in terms of where we'll be using that money. So I hope that addresses it. I'm not saying at all that going forward, we would not be doing any stock buybacks at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Andres or Victoria, I wanted to be clear on your 2012 guidance update. And in your updated slide, I did not see any mention of the $0.06 that you picked up for Cartagena this quarter. So to be clear, are you excluding that from your guidance? Had that already been budgeted in the original because I don't recall that? So how should we be thinking about that? And should we look at $0.37 as kind of the starting point to get to the $1.26? Or should we be really looking at $0.31?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Okay. Let's start back. I mean, first, the Cartagena, $0.06 that was part of our guidance from the start. We've also had some onetime costs associated with the acquisition of DP&L. So it's not just -- our run rate, I don't it's fair to say just the whole $0.06. There were some offsetting a couple of cents in the opposite direction, so no. That has been part of our guidance from the beginning. And then the numbers that we're giving you, you're starting from the $0.37 for the numbers that we have given for the full year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. I'll follow that offline as well. Second question, with regards to the projects and development that you laid out, can you just remind us the -- for the big one that you laid out, what is the equity contribution and to order from AES? When would those projects start contributing if they follow the schedule you planned? And what kind of return on that equity should we be thinking of in terms of potential earnings power from those projects?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Okay, that's a big question. Let me see and sort of put in pieces. I think when you're referring to the big budgets, you're not referring to like Mong Duong and Campiche because those were fully funded, right?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I'm talking about the projects in your slide that you had laid out in the development bucket.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Okay, the new one. So you're talking about Cochrane, you're talking about Alto Maipo and we're talking about Masinloc 2?","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Okay. Cochrane, the way to think about it as sort of cookie cutter, it's another Angamos. The -- right next door, and probably have the same equipment and maybe, say, contractor, similar offtake agreement with the mining company, one or more. So just think of the repetition of Angamos. In terms of the NPV created, for example, at Angamos, to give you an idea -- and again, I can't give you an exact number, we have target for Cochrane, not until we send all the PPAs and finalize the contract, but the NPV created at Angamos was about $300 million. And we're also expanding on the Angamos facility by putting a 20-megawatt battery, lithium ion battery facility there. Alto Maipo would be a very profitable project. It's a large project. It has a -- even though it's run of the river, there's a lot of construction involved. So that would -- if we -- starting now, this is a project which would come onstream around '15, '16. And so those are the 3 main projects. I think when you look at them from a -- so the other one, of course, is Masinloc 2. We -- so let me go back a little bit. So thinking of the 2 Gener projects, you're talking about probably equity needs of around $400 million over the next 3 years and that would come from -- locally through Gener's cash flow and other means. And then if we look at Masinloc, Masinloc does not have the same sort of support, which we're basically looking at a 630-megawatt expansion of the existing, current Masinloc facility. So you're probably talking about -- maybe half that amount, about $200 million. And that's a little bit less advanced than the 2 projects that are in Chile.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then given your comments on the share buyback and capital allocation, Andres, and if I heard you right, you should be looking for more share buybacks over the course of this year and beyond. In the past, you talked about some headwinds and the timing of projects coming on that may cause '13 to perhaps not be on the same path as the '12 to '15 guidance you've been talking about. Should we now see that not necessarily to be the case and perhaps share buybacks could be one way for you to keep '13 on the same path that keeps you going, the 8% to 10% total return, '12 through '15?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","What I was just following, if you look at this year, 2012, it's about a 20% increase in adjusted EPS from 2011, and that's obviously due to acquisitions plus new plants that were commissioned. When we look at '13, we obviously don't have that amount of new plants coming online. So it's not going to have the same sort of growth rate and nor have we said that our target is 8% to 10% every single year. Now we do think that if we -- executing on the share buybacks will help smoothen that path. But there is some inherent lumpiness in this business in terms of when the projects come online or when you execute on acquisitions, and also how quickly we can reinvest to the capital allocation process, additional funds from the asset sales. So what I would say here is that we're on track for 2012, and we're on track for the average growth rate from '13 to '15, and we'll update you as time passes. But we're not committing to an exact 8% to 10% every single year. And of course, that also includes our dividend payments. So that's -- we're really looking at a compounded annual growth rate in earnings, excluding dividends, of 7% to 9%.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Fishman of MorningStar.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just if you could explain some comments you made on DPL switching. The $27 million, was that year-over-year in the quarters due to switching? Or it was -- I didn't understand that $27 million.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","That is in the quarter. Yes, and that's sort of the year-over-year comparison. So that was the -- let's say, looking at had there been no additional switching, what it would have been? So we look at a year ago quarter, then we're saying that it's up $18 million from the reduction that we had from switching a year ago.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you are recapturing 78%, I believe I heard you say, and as...","Andres Ricardo Gluski","That's correct.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","If memory serves me, you were up on the high 80% level end of 4Q. If those numbers are right, is there an explanation for that? Is the competition tougher? Is -- can you add any color about what's going on?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Well, I can again -- I think that in general, there is more competition today than there was in the past and there's also aggregation. I think Andy can add some color on that.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Yes. Charles, Andy Vessey. You're right, when we think about it, what you're dealing with now is residential customers. And looking at a large commercial, industrial customers initially, we had a higher capture rate because we had a much tighter relationship they were in franchise. We had relationships ongoing. We had a high rate, not significantly high. We're still pretty good. So what you see is 2 things: One, you're seeing different classes of customers now. And now the competition is fully over at residential customers and they're coming either into markets or aggregation or sort of one-off door -- knocking on the door and getting an opt-in customer. The competition is increasing, so that's why the numbers have dropped slightly in the recapture. So our overall capture rate, if you work off the numbers that Andres has given us, is about 87% still affiliated with the DP&L brand, which is critically important because having that brand affiliation will help us with being able to place that generation going forward. So that's why it's very important for us to actually capture customers. I think one of the issues of aggregation, what we've seen here, is that it's going as we expected. There's been a little slowdown in the aggregation rate, meaning that actions haven't happened as quickly as we can, but we still think aggregation will move as we plan and as we expect. So that's -- it's pretty much playing out the way we're seeing it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Brian Chin of Citigroup.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on Slide 13, the AES Gener spot prices in Northern Chile. In prior Ks and Qs, you guys have identified that for 2012, you guys were expecting extra generation units in Chile to come online and that would suppress power prices in Chile. I had kind of assumed that you had baked that into your guidance, but when I see Slide 13 and you've got an extra $0.04 being there, that suggests that the impact from those plants coming online was a little bit bigger than what you guys had expected. Is that right? And is there further continued expected volatility in that, potential downside risk? Or can you give a little bit of extra color there?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Yes. That's not exactly right. What we're talking about was the fuel prices. I'll pass it on to Ned to provide more color, but that's really what's different from expectations.","Edward C. Hall","Brian, it's Ned Hall. The units did come online and they did impact the market as anticipated. As you know, we long-term contract, the majority is somewhere between 70% and 90% of all of our capacity or reliable capacity. As Victoria pointed out, in this year, we have a step-up cover in Angamos from 65% to 90%. So we still have the market exposure. And what's changed in terms of the spot pricing in the northern grid is a number of people who -- or utilize gas signed up for take-or-pay LNG contracts. And they have modified their bidding behavior to reflect the fact that those are take-or-pay contracts, which lowered the overall clearing price in the market as a result of that. Those -- our understanding is most of those take-or-pay contracts expire in the last quarter of this year. We don't anticipate that people will make that decision going forward. So in addition to us stepping up into a higher contracted position to 90% of Angamos, we also think that spot market prices and exposures that we do have out, over time, will improve as well. Then this period, where we're 65% contracted in the spot price, came down, reflecting that bidding behavior. It costs us the $0.04.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So I guess, the right interpretation of that then is if the bidding behavior has adjusted to sort of a different level now in that space due to the remainder of the year, then your guidance would remain on track at about $0.26.","Edward C. Hall","Yes.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then -- I'm sorry to beat a dead horse on this TIPRA thing. But in the event that TIPRA is not extended and you guys are able to put in those mitigating treatment mechanism, is that just a timing issue? Does that just push out the effect of TIPRA into 2013 or 2014 and avoid it having to hit '12? Or is there more of a permanent effect that, that treatment has on long-term?","Victoria D. Harker","No. It's a temporary impact for 2012. If TIPRA is not expended, we would, as Andres said earlier, need to be taking broader actions relative to the - to subsidiary dividends that we get from the countries that generate that tax impact. So it's a temporary measure relative to that. It has a onetime, end-year impact for us. And obviously, if it's not extended, we will continue to look to ways to find to mitigate the $0.02 to $0.03 remaining, but it doesn't -- it's not a permanent solution to the -- a lack of a TIPRA legislative approval by the Congress late this year or in the future.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Yes. The thing is, if it wasn't extended permanently, then we'd have to take some other actions. But obviously, we're not going to ever take a $0.10 to $0.12 hit.","Operator","The last question comes from Tom O'Neil [ph] of Green Arrow.","Unknown Analyst","Just a question on DPL, if I could. I was just wondering if you could decompose the switching by customer class that you saw this quarter. And I just wanted to clarify the absolute value of gross margin that you're talking about associated with that?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Okay. I think I can give you the breakout by customer class. I don't know by the quarter though.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Well, I mean, if you think about customer class, I mean, the fundamentals of the C&I customers have switched. You're not going to see much for that. That's being well saturated. What you're seeing is that what's remaining is that of our small commercial, about 52% have switched to date. And really -- where the action is really around the residential customers. As of the first quarter, only 21% or 22% of those customers have actually switched to alternate supply. So most of the competitive battle now is really for the residential customers and that's driven by just a lot of aggregation. In terms of the second question you asked, I really don't have those numbers in my mind. And so what I would suggest we do is that this is something we could talk about on -- I could get back to you with those after the call.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.","Ahmed Pasha","Okay.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Ahmed Pasha, you may begin.","Ahmed Pasha","Thanks, Alice. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to, Andres. Andres?","Andres Gluski","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Today, we reported second quarter EPS of $0.25 and proportional free cash flow of $62 million and we are reaffirming our 2015 guidance ranges for all metrics despite facing increased headwinds from foreign currencies.","Before Tom and I provide more color on our results for the second quarter and first half of the year, allow me to review our progress on the priorities for 2015 that I provided on our earnings call in February. First, we are making good progress to reach closure on key pending issues that could impact some of our businesses.","At Eletropaulo in Brazil, we have had a reasonable outcome in our four year rate case. At Maritza in Bulgaria, important milestones have been reached towards the resolution of our outstanding accounts receivable.","Second, we are executing on our construction program and leveraging our platforms. In April, we commissioned our 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong plant in Vietnam six-month early and under budget. Our remaining $7 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and we expect to bring 6 gigawatts online by the end of 2018. In July, we also broke ground on three new energy storage projects, including our first two in Europe.","Third, we are expanding our access to capital through partnerships at the project and business level. Today, I\u2019m very pleased to announce that we are forming a new 50\/50 joint venture with Grupo BAL to invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico.","And finally, regarding capital allocation, we have delivered on our commitment to invest at least $325 million in share repurchases. Today, we are announcing that we intend to utilize the approximately $100 million left on our buyback authorization during the remainder of this year.","In 2015, between buybacks and dividends, we will return $700 million to shareholders or approximately 8% of our current market cap.","I will provide more detail on these achievements in a movement, but now I\u2019d like to briefly discuss our financial results and our expectations for the remainder of the year on slide four. Our year-to-date 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.50 is in line with our results of last year and our proportional free cash flow of $327 million is well ahead of first half 2014 results.","Our earnings and cash flow are typically weighted towards the second half of the year. We expect our second half results to benefit from improved availability due to less plant maintenance, better hydrology in Latin America and higher collections in Bulgaria and the Dominican Republic. Although, there is still a lot of work to be done to deliver on stronger cash flow in the second half of the year, we remain confident that we will achieve our financial guidance for 2015.","Now, let\u2019s discuss some key issues at our businesses in Brazil on slide five. As we discussed on prior calls, we have seen a decline in electricity consumption in Brazil, which is the result of the economic recession and higher energy prices. Today, economists are projecting a 2% contraction of GDP for 2015.","In addition, dry hydrology is leading to high electricity prices by requiring the dispatch of more expensive thermal energy. As a result, we are forecasting a 4% year-over-year decrease in volume at our Brazilian utilities in 2015. Nonetheless, we have already factored in the softness in our prior forecast. As a reminder, every 1% change in volume in our Brazilian utilities has a $7 million pretax impact on our bottom line.","Turning now to hydrology on slide six. In Brazil, we have seen rainfall improve more than expected since our last call. In July, rainfall was 156% of the long-term average and reservoir levels are projected to be 37% by the end of August materially higher than the 20% levels at the beginning of the year. Improvement in hydrology in Brazil is reflected in spot prices, which are now around 120 reis per megawatt hour significantly lower than last year.","We now see the risk of rationing electricity in Brazil in 2015 as remote, but we continue to expect a negative earnings impact of $0.07 per share from poor hydrology this year. In Panama, we are observing a return to normal hydrology and spot prices are about $100 per megawatt hour, one-third of the prices we saw last year. In Colombia, our 1 gigawatt hydro plant Chivor is experiencing stronger inflows close to the historical average. While in the rest of the country, inflows are 90% of the long-term average.","Turning to slide seven, we have received approval for Eletropaulo\u2019s four-year tariff reset. This outcome sets a strong foundation for predictable cash flow and earnings from this business through 2019.","Lastly, we have successfully negotiated the restructuring of Brasiliana, where we own various businesses in partnership with BNDES, the state-owned development bank. Through this restructuring, we are separating our generation business, Tiet\u00ea, from other businesses under the Brasiliana umbrella. This separation will give us more control of operations and capital allocation decisions at Tiet\u00ea. Once this transaction is completed, we will be in a more favourable position to grow Tiet\u00ea by tapping into approximately $500 million of debt capacity at this business.","Turning to slide eight, as you may recall, in April, Maritza signed an MoU with its offtaker, NEK, whereby Maritza would receive a full payment of all arrears, which as of June 30 were $281 million in exchange for a reduction in the capacity price of the long-term PPA.","Since our last call, we have secured the required approvals from the project lenders and from the Bulgarian regulator. At the same time, the government of Bulgaria has taken concrete steps to improve NEK\u2019s financial position. Parliament has approved the energy sector reforms to support NEK through a new 5% tax on generators income as well as allocating all proceeds from the sale of the state\u2019s CO2 allowances to NEK.","Finally, the regulator announced an increase in the tariff of up to 20% for certain classes of industrial users and reduce NEK\u2019s commitment to procure more expensive renewable energy. These steps will strengthen NEK\u2019s financial position and allow the Bulgarian public sector to raise the necessary financing to pay their outstanding receivables. We expect to sign a binding agreement and collect on all arrears in the second half of the year. Collecting from NEK will be an important contributor to the improvement in our free cash flow in the second half of the year.","Now let\u2019s turn to our progress towards our strategic objectives beginning with construction on slide nine. Our construction program is the most important driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth in free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth in cash flow is the foundation for our commitment to a 10% annual dividend increase as well as all other capital allocation decisions.","From 2015 through 2018, we expect to commission 7 gigawatts of new capacity in comparison with roughly 600 megawatts we brought online in the three years from 2012 through 2014. Through June, we\u2019ve already brought online 1.3 gigawatts, which is nearly 90% of the capacity we plan to commission in 2015.","Moving onto slide 10, our remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction are progressing well and remain on time and on budget. As you can see on the slide, roughly 80% of this new capacity is in the Americas. As a reminder, total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but the AES\u2019 equity commitment is only $1.3 billion and all but $400 million has already been funded. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of more than 15%.","Turning now to slide 11, as we discussed on our last call, we achieved commercial operation on our 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam six months early and under budget. The plant is operating at full load and will help meet Vietnam\u2019s rapidly growing demand for electricity and provides us with a solid platform in the country.","Moving on to slide 12. We are the world leader in battery-based energy storage with 86 megawatts of installed capacity. We are seeing growing regulatory support and greater acceptance by utilities in our markets. As a result, we recently broke ground on three new energy storage projects totaling 40 megawatts in three countries.","We are consolidating our global leadership and now have a total of 70 megawatts of energy storage under construction that we expect to come online through 2016 and 200 more megawatts in late stage development. We are very well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' portfolio and eight years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage.","Turning to the new joint venture we are forming in Mexico on slide 13. Today, we announced that we signed an MoU with Grupo BAL, a Mexican business conglomerate with a market cap of $11 billion to pursue new power desalinization and natural gas projects.","Grupo Bal is one of the largest and most respected business groups in Mexico and one of Grupo Bal subsidiaries, Grupo Penoles is the off-taker of our TEP plant in Mexico. As you may know, Mexico is in the process of implementing new energy sector reforms, which will allow for greater private sector participation.","Over the next 10 years, it is estimated that Mexico will need 25 gigawatts of new or replacement generation. We have owned and operated a successful generation business in Mexico for more than 15 years and now with Grupo Bal we\u2019re poised to take advantage of the opening of the energy sector.","Turning to slide 14, looking at growth opportunities beyond our projects currently under construction, all of which we expect to complete by 2018, our future project mix is likely to be heavily weighted towards natural gas and renewable, while using our platforms to provide energy storage, desalinization and LNG related services. In particular, in arid and semi-arid regions such as Chile, where our plants on the coast are already providing desalinization for their own needs, long-term desalinated water contracts can be an attractive business.","Using existing infrastructure and permits significantly reduces the cost of providing desalinated water to third-parties such as municipal water authorities, mining and industrial customers. Based on all of the opportunities we see across our portfolio, we believe we can invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in attractive growth projects each year, which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing to our growth projects.","This amount of equity investment is quite moderate considering the strong growth in our free cash flow. In addition, we can use the debt capacity at our existing businesses such as Brazil, Chile, the Philippines and the Dominican Republic to fund growth projects.","Recycling capital has been and will remain an integral part of our strategy. Over the past four years, we have raised $3.1 billion in asset sale proceeds and another $2.5 billion in partner equity at the business and project level. These actions have permitted us to reposition our portfolio, pay down our debt, improve risk adjusted returns, and accelerate our growth profile.","Before turning the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize that as we have demonstrated to date, we will continue to compete all new investments against share repurchases in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.","To that end, as you can see on slide 15, we are returning $700 million to our shareholders in 2015, which is 8% of our current market cap. We have returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders since September 2011 and reduced parent debt by $1.5 billion or 25% while significantly lessening it\u2019s average tenure.","With that I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter and year-to-date results and full-year guidance in more detail.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Thanks Andres and good morning everyone. Our first-half results and the reaffirmation of our guidance demonstrate the benefits of our proactive actions to mitigate the impact from currency devaluation in other macro factors we\u2019ve experienced over the last several months.","Today, I\u2019ll review our second quarter results, including adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU, proportional free cash flow by SBU, then I\u2019ll cover our 2015 guidance and our 2015 capital allocation plan.","Turning to slide 17, second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was $0.03 lower than second quarter 2014. At a high level, we were negatively impacted by the following, $0.04 operating impacts, including timing of plant maintenance of certain businesses, as well as lower demand in contracting strategy in Brazil.","These were offset by favorable hydrology in Panama, in Colombia and new businesses coming online. We had a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar, which appreciated roughly 20% against the Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso, and the Euro. Finally a $0.02 net impact from other adjustments, primarily the favorable reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Kazakhstan in 2014 offset by the favorable reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo in 2015.","On the positive side, we benefited $0.04 from a lower tax rate of 30% this year versus 40% in the second quarter last year and a $0.01 from capital allocation net of asset sales, which resulted in 13% lower Parent debt, and a 4% lower share count relative to last year.","Now, I\u2019ll cover our SBU's financial performance in more detail on the next six slides beginning on slide 18.","In the U.S., adjusted PTC decreased by $24 million, due to planned maintenance in Hawaii and an IPL, as well as lower wind generation at Buffalo Gap in Texas. Proportional free cash flow was roughly flat, reflecting working capital recovery and lower interest at DPL.","In Andes, PTC decreased $23 million, primarily due to the timing of planned maintenance in Chile and Argentina, as well as a weaker Columbian peso. Proportional free cash flow declined by $37 million, due to lower earnings and higher tax payment at Chivor in Colombia versus last year.","In Brazil, PTC decreased $74 million. In addition to the $17 million impact from the depreciation of the Brazilian real, the decline was driven by approximately $13 million net impact from liability reversals in each period at our distribution businesses Sul and Eletropaulo.","You may also recall that last year our generation business Tiet\u00ea benefitted from spot sales at favorable prices, due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of a timing issue as Tiet\u00ea had to purchase in this spot market in the second half. This year, Tiet\u00ea's contract levels are flat in the first and second half, so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Last but not least, Sul has been affected by lower demand and higher costs.","Proportional free cash flow decreased $18 million, primarily driven by lower operating income at Tiet\u00ea as I just discussed. In MCAC, PTC increased a $11 million, largely driven by improved hydro conditions in Panama, where we generated more this year versus buying in the spot market last year. Panama also benefited from the commencement of operations of our 72 megawatt thermal power barge. Proportional free cash flow improved by $12 million, primarily driven by improved operating performance.","In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by $32 million mainly due to lower energy prices and the timing of planned maintenance at Chilvers [ph] [0:18:16] in U.K. Despite the decline in earnings, proportional free cash flow was up $3 million, largely by improved working capital at Maritza.","Finally in Asia, PTC increased $7 million, resulting from the early commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam, partially offset by the sale of minority interest in Masinloc in the Philippines in 2014. Proportional free cash flow was roughly flat.","Turning to slide 24, overall, we earned $251 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $89 million from last year and we generated $62 million of proportional free cash flow, an increase of $15 million.","As you can see on slide 25, year-to-date adjusted PTC declined $80 million, largely driven by lower demand and contracting strategy in Brazil, a stronger U.S. dollar, as well as the net impact from reversal of liabilities in Brazil and Europe.","These negative impacts were largely offset by the contributions from new businesses that came online earlier this year in our capital allocation decisions. Our proportional free cash flow increased $151 million to $327 million, primarily due to higher contributions from the U.S. and MCAC, including higher collections at DPL and improved working capital in Puerto Rico.","Year-to-date adjusted PTC and proportional free cash flow by SBU are in the appendix of today's presentation.","Now to slide 26, comparing our first half results to our full-year guidance, our earnings and cash flow tend to be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. Consistent with our prior expectations in the second half of 2015, we expect EPS to benefit from improved availability as a result of planned maintenance that was completed earlier in the year in Chile, the Dominican Republic, and the U.S. Improved hydro conditions in Panama and Colombia, seasonality related to contract generation businesses in the U.S. and Chile as well as IPL, the previously expected benefit from tax opportunities at certain businesses and finally contributions from Mong Duong in Vietnam which came online in first half of the year.","Regarding proportional free cash flow, improved results in the second half of the year versus the first half are driven in part by higher operating performance in the second half consistent with our earnings profile. The remaining increase is largely attributable to lower pension and fuel payments and IPL in the U.S., timing of income tax payments and VAT collections at [indiscernible], higher collection of receivables in the Dominican Republic and collection of receivables in Bulgaria, a portion of which will be used at the business for deleveraging and fuel payments.","Bottom line is that, we have to execute on our plan, we feel confident in our ability to meet our objectives for the year and we are reaffirming our guidance on all metrics. Our reaffirmed guidance is based on forward curves as of June 30 reflecting a benefit of couple of entities relative to our prior guidance which is based on March 31. Client curves as of July 31 were effectively back to where we were as of March 31. Our gains also assumes the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations and an unchanged full year tax rate of 31% to 33% versus year-to-date 2015 rate of 31%. Assumptions in sensitivities for our guidance are in the appendix of today\u2019s deck.","On to slide 27 in our parent capital allocation plan for the year, sources in the left hand side reflect total available discretionary cash for 2015 of roughly $1.65 billion which is $70 million higher than our last call. As a reminder, we previously announced asset sale proceeds in the sale of a portion of our interest in IPALCO and Jordan as well as the sale of the Armenia Mountain Wind farm. Today, we are also announcing the sale of our solar assets in Spain bringing our total asset sale proceeds this year to $573 million. We are also expecting an additional $45 million in return of capital from operating businesses which along with our parent free cash flow provides us with nearly $600 million available for dividend payments and growth, incremental share repurchases and other potential investments.","In terms of incremental sources of discretionary cash, as Andres mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate additional asset sale opportunities which could be $200 million to $300 million annually on average, but maybe lumpy year-to-year. Now to uses on the right hand side of the slide, we plan to invest about $350 million in our subsidiaries, 60% of which is at IPL and is already been funded. We\u2019ve invested $345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt leaving us with only $180 million in parent debt maturities through 2018. Finally, in addition to dividend, we are investing $420 million in our shares, which is $100 million more than we committed to on our last call. This brings total cash returned to shareholders through buybacks and dividends to $700 million for the year. We will continue to beat various investment opportunities to maximize per share value for shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andres.","Andres Gluski","Thanks, Tom. To summarize, we continue to make steady progress on our objectives specifically we are pulling all levers to achieve our financial objectives despite the headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil, lower foreign exchange and commodity prices. As I noted, overall hydrology in Latin America is improving as a result of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomena. We have achieved a number of milestones towards resolving Maritza\u2019s outstanding receivables after signing an MOU with NEK in April. We expect to collect outstanding receivables in the second half of the year.","We have completed the 1.2 gigawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam six months ahead of schedule and we are making good progress on the remaining 5.8 gigawatts under construction. We are bringing in financial partners to leverage our platform and maximize overall returns by forming a joint venture with Grupo BAL, a strong partner with significant presence in Mexico. And in 2015, we are investing than a $1 billion in returning cash to our shareholders and debt pay downs, in addition to the $350 million we are investing in profitable growth projects.","In conclusion, in line with the plans we laid out on previous calls, we continue to leverage our platforms and allocate our discretionary cash to maximize risk adjusted returns for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019d like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Andres Gluski","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Great quarter. Your commitment to capital allocation should be \u2013 is best-in-class. So thank you very much and I know your shareholders are certainly very happy. The question \u2013 sort of an open ended question firstly, there are so many moving parts to the guidance. I know you are on track to hit earnings guidance for the year and doing a little bit better on proportional free cash but if you look at and for the balance of the year versus the plan you laid out in March, is there any specific areas where you\u2019re a little bit ahead or little bit behind of where you would expected? I know overall you are still within the channel.","Andres Gluski","I would say that one of the key drivers we have as I mentioned on cash is Maritza and we had said that we would get this in the second half of the year. So we\u2019ve really achieved the important milestones. We are quite impressed with the commitment of the Bulgarian government to fix the electricity sector and parliament approving some \u2013 important reforms. So I think that\u2019s the key component, so we are on track there. I would say hydrology in July was quite frankly a little bit ahead of what we expected. And FX is more or less in line with what we expect. I think if anything, the demand in Brazil is softer \u2013 perhaps a little bit softer than we had expected even though we had those numbers in. So overall, we are kind of on track. I think the main points are that we have some seasonality and some of it in terms of collections, we tend to collect more in the Dominican Republic, we have Bulgaria, those are two discrete factors in the second half. And then we had a number of planned maintenance in the first half which won\u2019t happen in the second half. So that\u2019s sort of overall, it\u2019s not too far from our expectations I would say on a case-by-case basis.","Greg Gordon","That\u2019s good because one of your competitors in Brazil had a big disappointment in the second quarter as it pertains to their business. So I think there were some trepidation coming into your call that you might see a downward revision. Thank you. The second question is just to be clear, when you gave the first quarter guidance, you based your projections on March 31 index, so Tom, you\u2019re basically saying that if we roll forward to the end of July, we look a little more or less like we looked like at the end of March, so obviously still inside the guidance range.","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, that\u2019s correct. If you have asked us five weeks ago, we would have said we might be $0.01 or $0.02 up but I think we lost that in the last five weeks. So basically back to where we were end of March.","Greg Gordon","And then final question from me, the 104 to 204 of discretionary cash to be [implicated][ ph], if the stock price doesn\u2019t respond you guys continuing to execute at what point would you go to the Board and potentially allocate that to further share repurchases?","Andres Gluski","Greg, as we\u2019ve said in the past, our Board has been very supportive of our share buybacks and we\u2019ve always been able to go back and get a share repurchase authorization when we felt we needed it. So I think that there is \u2013 our sector has that have been hit in the last month by negativism and certainly that\u2019s been reflected in the stock price and certainly that affects our capital allocation decisions as we are comparing the value of buying back shares with our new projects.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you, guys. Thanks again for a great quarter.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Andres Gluski","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning. Andres, first question to you on Brazil, so as you said the hydro situation appears to be improving but you still have the FX headwinds, the economic and political outlook there continues to be very challenging from what we can tell. I just wanted to get a sense what is your tolerance level to absorb all of this. I mean are you there indefinitely for the long haul regardless of how old this place or how are you thinking about that relative to all the other jurisdictions where you have better opportunities perhaps?","Andres Gluski","Sure. I think a lot of our countries have cyclical patterns. Right now Brazil in on the \u2013 certainly not at the peak of one of these patterns. I will remind people I think of two, three years ago. Lot of questions I would get on these calls is why wasn\u2019t I investing more in Brazil and that we were slow. What we did at the time and continue to do today is we only invest when we see long term value. And we really see the value not quite frankly get caught in the trends. I think, you know Brazil is having a recession this year. It will probably have a flat 2017 and is expected, 2016, sorry and expected to pick up in 2017. Brazil is a big market, it is a country which has great potential and I think that us as a company of the Americas we should have a presence in Brazil. ","Now of course all of our assets we look at, what we consider their long term value. What we could sell them for and how they contribute to a balanced portfolio. So, overall what I would say is that I agree that the economic situations look challenging in Brazil, but realize this is a country with tremendous potential that could come back and we can\u2019t come in and out on a short-term basis. ","And the final thing is look we have been very prudent about again investments in Brazil, we still have $500 million of debt capacity at Tiete. So, growth in Brazil will come from leveraging the Brazilian businesses. So, I hope that answers your question, but I think that the point is that they are cyclical patterns; Brazil has a lot of capacity to rebound and as always when times were very good in Brazil we were always looking at what is the value and I would remind people that we sold a lot of Brazil at the peak. We sold our telecom business there for billion dollars. We also sold 50% of our holdings in Eletropaulo back in 2005. So, we will continue to make those adjustments as we see fit.","Ali Agha","Okay. The second question, I wanted to just clarify the capital usage plan going forward. If I heard you right, Andres, you were saying you may be investing $300 million to $400 million a year in new opportunities on an annual basis. Your dividend is consuming about $300 million of your cash and that's going to grow at 10% every year. So, where is the cash coming from? Because I'm looking at Parent cash and I think these investments and the dividend, I don't think there's any cash left. So am I missing something here or how is that being funded?","Andres Gluski","Well, yes, what you are missing from the equation is what Tom mentioned that we will be selling about $200 million to $300 million in our existing asset platform. So, if you include that the equation does close and realize that as our new plants come online they will be generating more cash as well.","Ali Agha","Okay. Got it. And then, lastly, to clarify your point, you benchmark everything obviously against share buybacks. So, are you seeing those opportunities out there that can still give you greater returns on a risk-adjusted basis than buying back your own share, that you're confident you can spend $300 million to $400 million a year on new projects?","Andres Gluski","Yes, we do. It really gets back to utilizing our platforms. So, I did mention the example, for example of de-sal. If you \u2013 basically we are upgrading our plants to use reverse osmosis technology and once you have the permit for intake of salt water and discharge of saline and you can basically put these in a modular fashion. These are very attractive opportunities. We are also seeing it in other places where we can add-on energy storage and the new projects we are engaged in. So, what I can tell you is that we are seeing above 15% returns on equity from our projects on average. So, yes, we are seeing a lot of attractive opportunities. Of course we are being very selective with our stock at these prices.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure with JPMorgan, your line is open.","Chris Turnure","Good morning, guys. I wanted to get a sense of the potential for GSF reform in Brazil and to get your opinion on the potential for that in general and then the potential structure if it does materialize. And then also, on the flip side, have you sought an injunction for Tiete there? And how would that work if others are successful with injunctions in penalizing of you and the remainder of guys out there that don't get injunctions?","Andres Gluski","Okay. Let me take the first one. This year, GSF will be between 17% and 19% and it\u2019s a considerable cost to the generators. I believe the total is somewhere above BRL 20 billion that people are paying. There has been discussions between the government, the Ministry of Energy and mines and the association such as [indiscernible] as well as you have a [indiscernible] and there has been talk about capping the GSF. The exact amount is being negotiated. Let\u2019s just give a hypothetical so it\u2019s capped 10%.","The generators will be compensated for that difference between 7% or 8% additional to the cap for example this year by an extension of their contract so you\u2019d receive a regulatory asset, especially of their concession, you\u2019d receive a regulatory asset equivalent to that amount. So, there is nothing set as of yet. There\u2019s certainly interest from the government interest from the regulators and we\u2019ll keep you informed.","In terms of the probability, I think on the previous call I was quite let\u2019s say prudent about this thing, we will see, I think the chances of something like this happening have improved. Regarding the injunction, Tom.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","I just see the \u2013 I haven\u2019t got all the details here, but there was initially compensation to one or small group of generators that was actually detrimental to the rest of the generators and we did participate with the larger generator community and saying that any \u2013 any decisions, any compensation should be consistent across the sector. That was some time ago and I believe the discussions are now focused on sector reform as Andre said it goes into compensation that really gets into concession renewal, or mind you our concession is well after [indiscernible] it is 2028.","In the GSF of 17 and 19 that\u2019s the number that we\u2019ve had now for a number of months. There is some possibility we\u2019ve seen thermal dispatch come down recently from about 19, I think 15.5 gigawatts which may indicate there could be some greater thermal generation i.e. a little bit of improvement on the GSF, but it\u2019s still far too soon to tell that just news over the last couple of weeks.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And then, switching gears, I just wanted to get an update on your Argentinian businesses or business down there. It's a little bit tough to break out in and of itself, how have earnings maybe trended the past couple of years there? And are those trends a function of regulatory changes to power prices? And how do you think about that business going forward, with the potential maybe for other regulatory changes to those power prices? And how do you think about things post the election?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","I think that\u2019s a great question. I\u2019d say of course if you take a longer-term view in terms of the past coming to the present you know pricing has deteriorated in Argentina, no question about that. On the other hand, I think we have fared very well from a regulatory position because as you know until last year we are exporting energy from Argentina to Chile, through our TermoAndes plant. We also have the only coal plant in the country. So, we have been selling energy under, in TermoAndes under the [indiscernible] which in the past was more favorable than it is today, but I\u2019d say in general you know we have always been making positive earnings in Argentina. So, even though they\u2019re less to say than they were four, five years ago, they continue to be positive. We have been receiving 96% payment on our accounts receivable, some of these are Fannie Mae bank bonds, these bonds are dollarized, they pay interest and for example like Guillermo brown plant where we have a considerable number of these bonds are basically being used to fund that plant. We\u2019re going to receive that plant, our proportion of it, very soon, it\u2019s being commissioned. So, I think overall in Argentina despite the challenging economic circumstances we\u2019ve done well that the one thing is we haven\u2019t been able to pay dividends out of Argentina for the last two years. Now, looking forward what do we see? I think the elections in October, the two leading candidates either one would be favorable. I think you\u2019ll have a gradual return to market-based pricing and a listing of the exchange controls. So, we have a tremendous asset base in Argentina. Of course, we\u2019re not putting any new money in at this stage, but I think we\u2019ve handled it well and I firmly believe that within a year or two we\u2019ll be paying dividends out of Argentina. It is basically considerably developed country and quite wealthy. So, it\u2019s again, I think it\u2019s probably on the rebound at this stage.","Chris Turnure","Okay. Would you characterize what you\u2019ve embedded in your long-term EPS and cash flow guidance as incorporating a lot of upside there or you remain conservative there?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","We\u2019re always conservative. So we never embed big upside. So, what I can say is we do expect sort of a continuation of what we\u2019ve been doing there, which I think is managing the situation quite favorably.","Chris Turnure","Great. Thank guys.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Stephen Byrd","Good morning.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Good morning Steve.","Stephen Byrd","Wanted to echo Greg\u2019s comments on capital allocations, very clear and I did want to take a little further into that following up on all these questions on the $300 million to $400 million in growth, in addition to asset sales and when you think about all of the other levers at your disposal in terms of just retain cash flow at the country level, the project level or other leveraged capacity etcetera, should we be thinking that those levers are quite significant and therefore could further reduce the amount of true equity at the parent or those more discretionary and not something that we should be thinking of as quite significant offsets in terms of the amount of equity needed at the parent.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yes, Steven, certainly as we look for growth, we do look to drive as much as we can out of the businesses as possible, I think there are big growth drivers, certainly Hahn Air has been a big driver. They\u2019ve brought in partners, they\u2019ve done project finance and the only equity that's been done in the last few years is a 150 million totally at the Hahn Air level. We did our 70% contribution. So that\u2019s a great example of a multi-billion dollar construction program and instruction in the Hahn Air balance sheet, and Hahn Air cash flow growth as much as possible. I think Andres has mentioned a couple other examples, Dominican Republic, we have some unused debt capacity that\u2019s currently being used to fund a facility upgrade and we look around the business to do that as much as we can.","IPO has been growing quite a bit also that really grows in more of a classic utilities down that we maintain a capital structure 55, debt 45, equity 30, more came to the normal utility, but we do that and we\u2019ll continue to look for leveraged capacity at the business, look to see whether a partner for a project or a business can come into help increase the value of the business and or bring in more effectively priced capital and then lastly if you will we\u2019ll look at up to the parent.","And the $300 million to $400 million is just a general range. I think that\u2019s the number we\u2019ve been at the last couple of years, you go back I think three years it was more in the mid-twos, so it\u2019s just a general indication.","Stephen Byrd","Understood great. And then just shifting over to your announced joint venture, can you just discuss at a high level the nature of the arrangement, is this effectively exclusive on both sides, are there other elements of the joint venture in terms of more specific targets or anything else that you can just a little bit further color on the JV would be appreciated.","Andres Gluski","Sure, Grupo BAL is one of the most reputable business groups in Mexico and it has a long tradition having been established around 1901 I believe. They\u2019ve been our off-taker at the TEP plant in \u2013 for the last 10 years and we\u2019ve been very pleased with us. They have another small joint venture with EDP for some wind projects and we have our existing plants of TEG, TEP and [indiscernible] which will be outside this joint venture. However, going forward, it\u2019s exclusive on both side that we\u2019ll exclusively look at new deals. There\u2019s no sort of target that we will invest X amount, it\u2019s really that we will look at these projects together, we both bring strengths, we bring the global size, our successful E&C experience, our ability to manage these plants and they bring the local component and knowledge of the sector. So, Mexico is opening up the energy sector, there are I think going to be a considerable number of bids for power plants not only of CFE, but also of private sector clients and also with our strategy of using our platforms for adjacencies such as desalinization or energy storage or for example LNG services, we can add those on. So, this is a - going forward it will be exclusive 50-50, we both have to agree to make an investment. If one partner does not agree with the investment the other one can make it on its own. So, this is I think very favorable for both sides. It gives us a lot of flexibility and it\u2019s really aiming to leverage off our strengths and the good thing is that we know each other, we\u2019ve been working together for more than a decade.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie, your line is open.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. I wanted to talk about Eletropaulo. So, you have just concluded a rate case there. What kind of load assumptions do you have embedded in that rate case and secondly is the restructuring of Brazilian having any impact on Eletropaulo?","Andres Gluski","Okay. I would say in terms of growth and as we said we\u2019re looking at a decline in growth and this - the numbers we gave are weighted average for Sul and Eletropaulo. The decline in demand is stronger in Sul than it has been in Eletropaulo. I think we\u2019re looking at pretty much flat demand for next year and then growing moderately after that. I mean the long-term growth in Brazil is what you normally expect is about 3% to 4% has been the historical average over the last 10 years. The second is how Brazilian affecting Eletropaulo. As you know in 2005 we sold down 50% of our holdings both us and B&DS of Eletropaulo and we basically took that money and de-levered the company. Then in 2011, we spun off the telecom Achimos [ph] and sold that. So, right now, between the two of us, we have about 32% that is Braziliana has it, we have 16%, roughly a little bit more than 16%. I don't really think that the Braziliana structure has been affecting Eletropaulo directly. I think that the distributors have been I think more fairly treated over the past six months than they had before and that's why you\u2019ve seen a recovery in the place. I mean Eletropaulo\u2019s stock should be up I believe about 70% in dollars this year and in fact the sector it\u2019s been the best performing within the sector by a considerable margin. I think part of that is perhaps it was dropped also more strongly because some of the let's say decisions against us, but we got a good decision on a regulatory asset base, the WAC has been raised over 8%. So these are all favorable things. Now unquestionably other than the regulated part, which as I said the market is recognizing, it\u2019s making certain investments to continue to improve quality of service and it will depend on the recovery of the Brazilian economy.","I believe that the Brazilian government is doing the right things at this time and taking some very brave decisions, including cutting spending, raising interest rates and that these will have good long-term effects, but certainly they\u2019re very tough in the short-run, but I really commend their bravery. So, I don\u2019t know if that answers your question. I mean what we see in Eletropaulo is a tough 2016, I\u2019m sorry a tough 2015, a more moderate 2016 and a recovery more in 2017, 2018.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Thank you, just one more, on Mong Duong, so the plant came online six months ahead of time, the hydro conditions across the board seem to be in line with expectations, everything else is in line with expectations. So, should we just see this plant that\u2019s potentially moving you beyond the midpoint of your guidance or what\u2019s the potential offset if it\u2019s not the case?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","What I would say is that at this stage we are reaffirming the guidance ranges. I think there are - that\u2019s not only earnings, but cash flow. Certainly, on cash flow depending on where we\u2019d be in the range, the payment at Maritza is obviously a big mover because you talk about the range of a billion, 1.4 billion, 1.350 billion and 280 million will make a difference. On the other hand, right now I would say that we remain within that guidance range. Certainly, we don't see in the five months that are left something that would likely move us outside of those ranges to the upside.","Angie Storozynski","Fantastic, thank you very much.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill with Barclays, your line is open.","Gregg Orrill","Yes, thank you. Was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the potential of caps on rationing exposure in Brazil and how that might affect that regulatory asset, might affect you either in magnitude going from the 10% to the 17% to 19% maybe how those things might be recorded financially? Would that help you from an earnings perspective as well as cash flow?","Andres Gluski","Let me answer the first part and then Tom can answer the second part how we\u2019re looking. We see - the probability rationing this year is very low. And there are two drivers; one, the government has done a very good job of basically running thermals and saving water, and the rains did come in considerably stronger. Quite frankly as of mid July, the reservoir levels were at 41% which is very high. You should be quite frankly declining at this time of the year. So the likelihood of rationing this year not to say it\u2019s impossible, it\u2019s very remote and if rains continue as expected, it\u2019s not very likely in 2016 again assuming the government continues this policy. In addition to that, you\u2019ve had a decline in demand. So you put those two together, again it\u2019s a much stronger position vis-\u00e0-vis having rationing this year and next than it was before and this year is substantially less. In terms of the regulatory asset, I mean that\u2019s a considerable number but I will leave it to Tom in terms of how much we would actually book.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yes, Greg. I think you\u2019re ahead of us. If there is something that allowed for Tiet\u00ea concession which is now ends in 2029, allows it to get extended, going to valued the economic value, does it turn into a regulatory asset that we would record, we are still early on to understand the detail. Certainly we\u2019ll look at that from a GAAP standpoint, but I think it\u2019s early to think \u2013 too hard about that.","Gregg Orrill","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar Equity. Your line is open.","Charles Fishman","Good morning. In 2016, I see in slide 53 that you\u2019re still seeing flat to modest growth. With what\u2019s going on in Brazil with maybe your tax rate returning to a more normalized level, you won\u2019t get as much incremental benefit from Mong Duong because it fortunately came on early. What gets you to the modest growth for next year, realizing its flat to modest growth, the guidance doesn\u2019t change.","Andres Gluski","I think that the positives, we have the Cochrane coming on. This is a 552 megawatt construction project in Chile and that\u2019s proceeding very well, and we also have rate based growth at IPL. We completed the 2,400 megawatts of upgrades and then of course you mentioned Mong Duong, but we have a full year. And the other thing is of course capital allocation and it will also depend on hydrology. If we have continued good hydrology and specifically for example in the case of Chivor, Chivor typically has a very \u2013 it\u2019s a very good base that is in. So it tends to have less volatile hydrology than the rest of Columbia. So when you have right now, El Nino, it\u2019s getting \u2013 the rest of Columbia is dry and actually Chivor is at average. And so then actually you get better prices for the energy you sell that you haven\u2019t had contracted. And finally, we expect some normalization of the currencies as well. So all sorts of things that can cause this now.","I agree 2016, if we look out the next three years, 2016 is on top this year because 2017 and 2018 we have a lot more projects coming online. The other thing is we realize that on some of these adjacencies such as energy storage or desal, these can be operational in a very short period of time. And desally will depend quite frankly, we have to build a pipeline to a client but some of those cases we don\u2019t. So those are additional things that could help.","Charles Fishman","Okay. And then second question Andre, I realize you got a lot more going on in the U.S. but the clean power plant seems to have more benefit towards renewable. I would think that would be good for your storage business. Is that correct?","Andres Gluski","Yes, absolutely. I think that the clean power plant let\u2019s say increase because it\u2019s basically what they had laid out before, but accelerates it \u2013 increases the market for energy storage and California has really led the way requiring 1,325 megawatts of utilities to have by 2020. So this I think accelerates the adoption of energy storage.","Charles Fishman","And so you\u2019ve got Ohio is going for storage and then California and Europe under construction, is that correct?","Andres Gluski","We are not under construction yet in California. That will be in 2019 when we start, but we have 100 megawatts with Southern California.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Thanks.","Andres Gluski","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mitchell [indiscernible]. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. Could you discuss a little bit on some of the core outages, [indiscernible] mentioned some of its plans that are coned by you, experienced high outage rates in the second quarter and just wanted to get some color from you if you saw that at all of your plans or if it was just like [indiscernible] and what went on and how you guys are working on hopefully fixing that.","Bernerd da Santos","Hello, this is Bernerd da Santos. Yes, that plan is [indiscernible] beginning of the year. With the management we have implemented 180 days plan that is ongoing. We have already 30 days. We have our next preview with the team 50 days from now. I was present with the management team two weeks ago in Stuart and we have seen improvement. So we expect that we\u2019re going to calculate whether it was the force outage rates in Stuart by the end of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","So you are finding it specifically to add Stuart?","Bernerd da Santos","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Unidentified Analyst","And is this going to impact your ability to get into the capacity performance Stuart planned.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","No, we\u2019ll factor that in. [indiscernible] are factored in but we would expect as Bernerd said an improving Ephod [ph] overtime.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning guys. Just checking in here, in terms of the next accretion, you guys are talking about for the asset sales and talk about share buybacks in place. What\u2019s the net benefit of the $200 million to $300 million in asset sales you\u2019re contemplating for this year relative to the share buybacks, break even or positive accretion?","Tom O\u2019Flynn","That\u2019s probably little positive. I think the overall PE of our sales about 13, we do split that between debt pay down and share buybacks. So net-net, it\u2019s probably about maybe a breakeven \u2013 positive of breakeven.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, excellent. And then can you just update us on what are the pending finalization of the issues in Bulgaria? From what I understand, that should be happening very soon. Or just is there anything really in the way there to make that happen?","Andres Gluski","At this point, we really have all the approvals necessary, so now it\u2019s a question of the Bulgarian public sector raising the funds for the payment. So there is no sort of pending important approval at this stage as basically they have to do the market operations to get the funds and to pay us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Great. And then lastly in terms of deleveraging the business in South America, what\u2019s the timeline there, just the FX or so I mean how quickly should we expect these asset sales to come up and ultimately what\u2019s your interest in these assets. I presume it\u2019s pretty real [ph].","Andres Gluski","Basically we will look for real value before we leverage up today as we have in the past. When you mentioned asset sales, perhaps I think you\u2019re talking about Petrobras and hydro who may be selling some assets. We certainly look at them. What I want to say is that, we will never grow for growth sake and these really have to makes sense, and they have to make sense which should they in terms of a portfolio, there have to be things which would decrease its hydro risk. So it will depend on their contract position and other thing, so there is nothing really short term on this. We are looking at the possibility of doing something like [indiscernible] for example in Brazil as we did in Panama. But I think the main point is [indiscernible] not AES.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just remind us what the target leverage at [indiscernible].","Tom O\u2019Flynn","Yeah. We looked at debt-to-EBITDA but right it\u2019s quite unlevered and its dividends are restricted by earnings. So it\u2019s not possible to do a recap and bring money upstairs. So if you want to use the leverage capacity it will be for growth within Tiet\u00ea. And as Andrew said, the growth would be within Tiet\u00ea funds rather than AES.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. And what\u2019s the target leverage for GFA just to get a sense of how much capacity there is today.","Tom O\u2019Flynn","We will use about $400 million to $500 million U.S. dollar capacity, that\u2019s back into that \u2013 yeah, there will be capacity so you could obviously gross that up to the extension buying an asset that comes with cash flow, you could use a larger number. And that\u2019s exactly goes upon the coverage ratio.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you guys.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Sir, you may begin.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Veronica. Good morning, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call of The AES Corporation. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, we continued to execute on our strategy. And despite facing headwinds at some of our businesses largely due to very high dry hydrology in Latin America, we're on track to deliver on our guidance. We earned $0.39 of adjusted EPS this quarter, which brings our year-to-date total to $1.01 or 79% of the midpoint of our 2013 guidance. Regarding cash flow, we expect to achieve the high end of our proportional free cash flow and more importantly, the high end of our Parent free cash flow guidance. We remain focused on the long-term objectives that we laid out 2 years ago, which will be the key to our success. To that end, to improve profitability, we are increasing our cost savings target by $55 million. To simplify our geographic footprint, we have closed or announced $475 million in asset sales proceeds or 95% of our target for 2013. And to bring our dividend in line with our policy, we're raising our quarterly dividend by 25%.","Let me now provide you with some details on each one of these initiatives. First, turning to Slide 5. I will discuss our efforts to improve our profitability. We expect to achieve 93% of our prior cost savings target of $145 million, originally set for 2014 this year. We are therefore raising the bar by $55 million and are committing to sustainable cost savings at the AES level of $200 million by 2015.","To achieve this goal, we're taking a number of additional steps, including moving our back office tasks to lower-cost locations, reducing the number and size of our corporate offices and making greater use of global sourcing and synergies. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to improve our bottom line as part of our overall leadership agenda.","Next, turning to Slide 6. I will provide you with an update on our asset sales, where I'm pleased to report that we continue to make good progress. As you may have seen, today, we announced 3 asset sales, including our Cameroon business for $220 million in proceeds to AES. We're also cleaning up our wind portfolio by sending older units or those in markets in countries where we do not have a significant platform. To this end, we recently sold 39 megawatts of a wind project in Gujarat, India, allowing us to focus our efforts on the platform expansion projects in the Indian state of Odisha, where we do have significant growth opportunities.","We also just announced the sale of our Polish Wind development projects as the necessary market reforms in Poland had been indefinitely postponed. All of these transactions are consistent with our commitment to exit those markets where we do not feel we have a sustainable competitive advantage.","Since September 2011, we have closed or announced the sale of 21 businesses for total proceeds to AES of $1.4 billion. Including today's announcements, we will have exited 8 countries and will be down to operating in 20 from 28 2 years ago. We see an overall universe of potential asset sales proceeds exceeding $2 billion by 2015, including the $1.4 billion in asset sales already announced.","Now turning to Slide 7. I will provide you with some color on our third objective, optimizing capital allocation. We believe that capital allocation is a critical tool for creating shareholder value. We expect significant improvement in our Parent free cash flow over the next few years, allowing us to grow discretionary cash available for investments or to be returned to our shareholders. This growth will be largely driven by contribution from new businesses, reduced operating costs and deleveraging at the businesses. Tom will provide details on our uses of discretionary cash. But as we've demonstrated year-to-date, we will use a balanced approach to capital allocation, making sure that we compare all possible uses, including stock buybacks, dividend increases, debt paydowns and platform expansions.","To that end, since September 2011, we have prepaid $1 billion of debt, including $820 million of recourse debt, reducing our Parent debt by nearly 15%. With this debt reduction and our growing cash flow, we have made significant progress in improving our overall credit profile.","In terms of share buybacks, which have been and will remain an integral part of our capital allocation framework, since September 2011, we've invested $453 million in repurchasing 39 million shares at an average price of $11.58 per share. We currently have remaining buyback authorization of $237 million.","Finally, our total return commitment to shareholders includes a modest dividend, which we initiated last year. We have said that we plan to grow the dividend over time. And to that end, our board has approved an increase in our annual dividend payment of 25% to $0.05 per quarter, beginning with the payment in the first quarter of 2014. This implies a total annual dividend payment of $150 million or 30% of our sustainable Parent free cash flow, up from 24% previously. This increased payout is in line with our 30% to 40% payout ratio target that we announced at our Investor Day in May of this year.","Turning to Slide 8. I will now provide you with a few updates on some of our larger businesses, beginning with Bulgaria, where we own Maritza, a fully contracted 690 megawatt lignite-fired plant. As we discussed in our last call, NEK, the offtaker, has been facing liquidity issues. Our receivables balance has grown modestly since our last call, but 90% is still less than 90 days overdue.","Over the last couple of months, the Government of Bulgaria has passed new laws, which once implemented, should help improve NEK's financial position. We are closely monitoring the situation and we will update you if there are any significant developments.","Now I will discuss DP&L where the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, or PUCO, has ruled on the Electric Security Plan, or ESP. In this order, the Commission approved $110 million in annual Service Stability Rider through 2016 which provides certainty in the near term, while we continue to work with the Commission to address challenges in 2017 and beyond. Nonetheless, we have filed for a rehearing of certain elements of the order. In particular, we have challenged the conditions attached to the $45 million Service Stability Rider that can be recovered in 2017. We expect the Commission's response in the near future, and we anticipate that the rehearing process will take 6 to 9 months.","Finally, as you may know, the ESP order required us to separate DP&L's 3,300 megawatts of generation capacity by May of 2017. We will be filing the generation separation application by the end of this year. Subsequently, we will develop a plan that will allow for separation of the generation business by May 2017.","Beginning on Slide 9, I will provide you with an update on a few other key initiatives that will contribute to our future earnings growth. First, as you may recall, last quarter, we talked about our plans to bring on partners at our existing businesses and growth projects. Consistent with that approach, we have brought on Google as a partner in the 266-megawatt Mount Signal Solar project, which is under construction at our joint venture, the Silver Ridge Power Corporation. Under this agreement, Google will invest $103 million in Mount Signal, and we expect that about half this amount will come back to AES in 2014 as discretionary cash. Commercial operation of Mount Signal is expected by the second quarter of 2014.","Similarly, last quarter, we signed an agreement with Antofagasta Minerals, a large Chilean mining conglomerate, allowing them to participate as a 40% partner in our Alto Maipo hydro project. We continue to look for similar opportunities across our portfolio to optimize our exposure on specific projects, maximize our overall returns and augment the discretionary cash available for other capital allocation purposes. Year-to-date, we have signed agreements for $500 million in equity participation from partners at the project level.","Second, in my view, AES has an unmatched footprint in many attractive markets where demand for new generation is expected to grow for the foreseeable future. While expected demand growth is low in some of our markets, particularly the U.S., we continue to see robust growth and demand for new generation in many of our markets such as Columbia, Chile, India, Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam, where we see demand growth in the range of 4% to 8%. We're also complementing our investments in larger scale plants with smaller scaled platform enhancements and adjacencies, such as fogging technology for gas turbines, energy storage, desalinization, to maximize returns from our existing footprint and asset base. While individually, many of these projects will be relatively small, they provide significantly higher risk-adjusted returns, and in the aggregate, may become meaningful over time, particularly, if we can achieve economies of scale given our global presence.","As a recent example of this, we brought online a 40-megawatt energy storage resource at DP&L in Ohio, to provide essential reserve capacity at PJM. This project brings our total energy storage resource to more than 200 megawatts, equivalent to 100 megawatts of interconnected capacity, making us the world leader in using lithium-ion batteries for energy storage and grid stability.","While we see this particular business line as an attractive area for investment as we can earn solid returns on projects that require significantly shorter construction time, and unlike most of our assets, can be redeployed should expected returns at original site not materialize as expected. The need for energy storage will grow as the contribution of energy from renewable sources increase. For example, California is recognizing the value of fast, flexible storage resources as an integral part of a robust power grid. The 3 large utilities in California have targets to procure at least 1,325 megawatts of capacity between 2014 and 2020. Our existing facilities in California have all of the necessary infrastructure and are ideally located to support competitive development of energy storage. We plan to selectively add energy storage solutions to our existing platforms where their services can be adequately remunerated as a way to better serve our customers while increasing our return on assets.","Another adjacency that we are pursuing is desalinization, where we see a number of potential opportunities in some of the markets we serve. This week, we signed an MOU with Abengoa to develop a $26 million, 800 cubic meter per hour water desalinization facility, adjacent to our Angamos plant in Chile. This facility will use our existing water intake, discharge infrastructure and permits. Once completed, this project will provide raw water to Angamos and third-party customers.","Turning to Slide 10 and conventional platform expansions, such as rate base growth at IPL, we have commenced construction of a $500 million project to upgrade 2,400 megawatts of coal-fired capacity to comply with environmental regulations. The equity investment in this project is expected to be slightly more than $200 million and will be invested over the next 3 years. IPL will be eligible to earn a cash return on the investment during construction.","I would also like to provide you with an update on our 531-megawatt Alto Maipo, run-of-the-river hydro project in Chile. Together with our 152-megawatt Guacolda V and 532-megawatt Cochrane coal-fired projects, Alto Maipo is one of the few development projects in the growing Chilean market under construction or in late-stage development. We now have all of the key permits in place and Anker mining offtaker is a 40% equity partner, civil work, tunneling and the electro-mechanical EPC contract signed. We're also making good progress on Alto Maipo's financing, which is the last remaining major milestone. We expect to achieve financial close and begin construction before year's end.","Last but not least, I'm pleased to report that all of our 2,231 megawatts of construction projects are progressing on time and on budget.","With that, let me turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Let me first off cover our Q3 results, including adjusted EPS, adjusted free tax contribution, or PTC, by SBU and cash flow. Then I'll touch on our 2013 guidance, drivers by SBU and our capital allocation plan. Finally, I'll cover the longer-term outlook, including our expected growth rate for the next couple of years and some drivers for 2014.","Turning to Slide 12. We had a solid third quarter, and our adjusted EPS increased by $0.04 or 11%. The impact of dry hydrology on several of our Latin American businesses was offset by higher margins in United Kingdom and Dominican Republic and lower interest expense on recourse debt. In addition, we benefited from a lower effective tax rate of 26% versus 33% a year ago, which added about $0.03.","Before I go into the results, let me summarize hydrology. As you can see on Slide 13, several of our Latin American markets, including Chile, Colombia and Panama, have experienced very dry hydrology. In fact, 2013 is the driest year in more than 4 decades in Panama, and it's very unusual to have dry conditions in all these markets at the same time. Consistent with our second quarter results, unfavorable hydrology had a negative $0.04 impact in the third quarter and $0.12 on a year-to-date basis. For the fourth quarter, we're expecting only a modest impact of $0.01, as hydrology has stabilized across our portfolio.","Spot prices in Panama, Chile and Brazil have declined by 30% to 40% from unusually high levels over the last few months, which is helpful because we've been recovering some of our shortfall in the spot markets. In Panama, water inflows at our Changuinola plant are improving after the rainy season. In recent weeks, water inflows have recovered from about 70% of historical averages to about 80%, and we expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter. In Brazil and Colombia, reservoir levels are about normal for this time of year. Overall, we expect normal hydrology next year. We've also taken actions to minimize impacts from dry hydrology, such as modifying our contracts in Panama to reduce our overall exposure to the spot markets.","Now I'll briefly review third quarter PTC at each of our SBUs, beginning on Slide 14. In the U.S., we reported a decline of $17 million, driven primarily by customer switching at DP&L as anticipated. As of Q3, 70% of the loaded DP&L had switched compared to 57% last year.","Our outlook for DP&L since receiving the ESP order is that it should contribute roughly $85 million to $95 million of annual PTC through 2015. DP&L results should benefit from a higher Service Stability Rider, targeted cost reductions of $20 million to $30 million and lower interest expense. These will be offset by additional customer switching and a lower tariff resulting from lending under the new ESP.","Our Andes SBU was largely flat for the quarter, Chivor declined due to low hydrology in Colombia and Chile declined as a result of higher spot purchases from planned maintenance and lower contract prices. These trends were offset by higher income at AES Argentina.","Brazil was also flat for the quarter, weaker Brazilian real as compared to last year, as well as lower generation at Tiet\u00ea and higher interest expense at Sul reduced results for the quarter. These are largely offset by an increase in Eletropaulo for the quarter as a result of higher volumes and lower cost.","Next on Slide 15, our Mexico, Central America and Caribbean, or MCAC, SBU was also flat. Here, dry conditions in Panama were largely offset by an $18 million improvement in the Dominican Republic due to higher volumes and prices. Our Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, SBU increased through the quarter by $15 million, driven largely by our Kilroot coal-fired plant in United Kingdom, where we benefited from higher dark spreads. As we anticipated in our guidance, Asia declined for the quarter as a result of the China asset sales completed last year and higher contracted sales at Masinloc, which reduced its merchant exposure at the end of last year by signing a 7-year contract to 2019.","Finally, our corporate charges improved $28 million for the quarter, driven by lower interest expense from the Parent refinancing we executed in the second quarter. We also had some modest reductions in development cost this quarter. Across the SBUs and Parent Company, adjusted PTC increased $7 million for the quarter.","Since the formation of the SBUs a year ago, we've been actively managing G&A expenses on a global basis. Andres mentioned the increased target of $55 million by 2015. So far, we've largely communicated our savings in the G&A expenses line on our income statement, although we've also targeted reductions in administrative costs reported in cost of sales.","Going forward, much of our administrative cost savings will be recorded in our cost of sales line, as we reduced costs related to the management of our business units. From an Investor Relations standpoint, we'll continue to share targets and related progress against global G&A expenses, independent of income statement classification. When we reach our cumulative annual savings target in 2015, we will have reduced our G&A by at least 30%.","Now to our cash flow metrics beginning on Slide 16. For the fourth quarter, proportional free cash flow was $347 million, bringing our year-to-date results to $847 million. Q3 declined from last year by approximately $150 million, driven by low proportional operating cash flow in Brazil and EMEA, as well as $40 million of higher environmental CapEx at IPL in the U.S.","On Slide 17, with our Q3 results, we're on track for the year. As you may remember, we provided adjusted PTC ranges by SBU. The mix of contributions from our SBUs have changed, but the bottom line remains the same. We had challenges in MCAC in Brazil, primarily due to poor hydrology and lower demand. We've offset these negatives with higher contributions from the U.S. and lower G&A and interest expense, as well as a lower effective tax rate.","As Andres mentioned, we reaffirmed our guidance on all metrics. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.24 to $1.32 includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from the Ukraine and Cameroon asset sales announced this year.","During the third quarter, we recorded approximately $340 million in impairments in our GAAP EPS. Some were triggered by our asset sales efforts, including $130 million of impairments of our Cameroon businesses and our Polish wind pipeline. We're obviously disappointed with these impairments, but believe it's important to focus our portfolio and also to react to significant market changes as they occur.","Turning now to Slide 18. As Andres mentioned, we expect to be in the high end of our proportional free cash flow guidance range of $750 million to $1.05 billion this year. This $1 billion or so of proportional free cash flow is after $900 million of maintenance and environmental capital expenditures.","Our normalized maintenance CapEx is about $600 million to $700 million, but we have about $250 million of additional environmental CapEx at Gener and IPL. The IPL program is essentially growth CapEx as we earn a cash return during construction and into the future. We expect these environmental CapEx programs to be largely completed by 2015.","In terms of uses of this proportional free cash flow, over the last few years, we've used about $500 million per year to pay down nonrecourse debt at our subsidiaries and remaining cash is available for discretionary uses at AES. This debt paydown at subsidiaries creates equity value that we can capture through proceeds and refinancings for other distributions. As we said last quarter, we expect to be at the high end of our $400 million to $500 million range for Parent free cash flow, which is the key driver of our dividend capacity.","Let me now touch on 2013 capital allocation on Slide 19. In 2013, we expect to generate $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of discretionary cash, including Parent free cash flow of about $500 million that I just mentioned. Factoring in the $239 million of asset sale proceeds already received this year, we've invested roughly 60% of our cash in delevering and returning cash to shareholders. After proved investments, we'll have about $120 million to $270 million in discretionary cash remaining, which will obviously increase when we receive the $236 million of proceeds from the 3 transactions we just announced today.","Regarding the uses of discretionary cash to be allocated, much of the cash is received in the fourth quarter. We'll continue to use it to achieve the highest risk adjusted returns for our shareholders, including share buybacks and investments in platform expansions. To that end, we expect to invest roughly $100 million in the potential equity issuance at Gener to fund its growth program. We'll keep you updated as Gener's financing plans are finalized.","Now I'd like to discuss guidance on Slide 20, currently in the latter stage of our annual long-term planning process. In 2014, we see EPS growth in line with our 4% to 6% EPS trajectory, which assumes a normal year for hydrology but also a higher effective tax rate. Year-over-year, in '14, we expect moderate growth from Andes, Brazil, MCAC and EMEA, and flat to modest declines in the U.S. and Asia. Through 2015, we're reaffirming our average annual total return of 6% to 8%, which includes EPS growth of 4% to 6% and a dividend yield of 1% to 2%.","Relative to our prior guidance, the increased cost savings adds about $0.05 for 2015. That said, we have net offsets of a similar amount. For example, Brazil is down from prior expectations by almost $0.05 due to slower demand growth and foreign exchange.","With respect to cash flow, we expect the proportional free cash flow and Parent free cash flow will grow faster than earnings, as we realize the contributions from our projects under construction and complete environmental capital expenditures.","In February, on our fourth quarter call, we plan to issue specific 2014 EPS and cash flow guidance. We'll also provide an update on 2015 expectations and give some color on significant drivers for periods thereafter. We're committed to delivering compelling earnings growth over time in order to ensure an attractive total return for shareholders.","Lastly, as Andres mentioned, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.05 per share for the dividend payable in February, with an ex-dividend date of January 30. Going forward, we plan to assess potential increases in our dividend once a year. This year, we're a bit ahead of schedule. Normally, we plan to review the dividend with our board in December and communicate any changes that would be effective with our first quarter dividend.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Tom. In summary, we are seeing the results of executing on our strategy and we're delivering on our commitments.","On this call, we've just announced 3 asset sales, including all 3 businesses in Cameroon; increased our sustainable cost savings targets by 38%; and announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend. At the same time, we're executing on important platform expansions, bringing on equity partners at the project level, developing platform enhancements in adjacent businesses, all aiming to increase our return on assets over time.","AES has a diversified portfolio of businesses in attractive markets that generate growing earnings and cash flow and provide us with multiple opportunities to create long-term value for our shareholders.","Operator, I'd now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Cohen.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all on Parent free cash flow. It looks like you're going to be at the high end of the range for '13 despite some challenging conditions operationally. If I fast forward, it seems like you're going to be paying down a lot less debt in the future, environmental CapEx will be lower, you have additional cash from cost savings from the Google transaction, $700 million of asset sales. At what time are you going to be in a position to update us on longer-term capital allocation strategies?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I think that we've laid out a sort of a very clear strategy. We are very cautious about announcing investments until we get to sort of the final stages of those investments. However, when we update you, first quarter of next year, we'll be giving short of the big pools, as Tom has done, in terms of where we will be allocating our capital. I don't know, Tom. Would you like to add something to that?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Jon, I'd just say probably 2 things. We do think our cash flow will grow at a good rate, higher than the EPS growth rate for the next couple of years, and certainly, as we look into the future, we think cash flow will continue to grow at that level. That's both proportional free cash flow, as well as Parent free cash flow. I think you hit it, proportional free cash flow and which of the driver for Parent should really be aided by the reduction in capital expenditures. So going out, we think CapEx will be more $600 million to $700 million rather than the $850 million to $900 million starting in '16, that obviously excludes growth CapEx. So that will help drive subsidiary dividend capacity. And at the Parent, we think we're generally rightsized for our debt capacity with this asset mix at the Parent, so we got $5.5 million, $5.6 million of recourse debt at the Parent, which we think is generally right with this asset mix. So we think cash flow should continue to have a good growth trend.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one clarification. When you say that you expect normal hydro conditions next year, given that this year was a $0.13 headwind, does that mean that, all else equal, there should be another $0.13 of earnings from normal hydro next year? And is that fully offset by the higher tax rate, or is there some upside there?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Well, all things equal, yes, we won't have the negatives. Certainly not the $0.12 that we've had year-to-date. But having said that, yes, we will have a higher tax rate that will offset some of that. And quite frankly, the higher tax rate is one of the other reasons why our cash is going faster than our earnings over the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So firstly, on the sales, congratulations first off on getting these latest done. When you talk about $2 billion and having executed thus far on a good chunk of that, what else, broadly speaking, is in the pipeline, if you could can talk about it? And then specifically, does that incorporate an assumption around or an expectation for the Silver Ridge transaction? Is that part of that $2 billion?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, I'm not going to comment on any specific transactions, but I think what we played out and is that, again, those that we really don't feel we have a sustainable competitive advantage and are not sort of where we have our growth occurring are those that are slated for sale. And we've gone from 28 to 20 countries. I could see us getting out of perhaps another 5 countries. But as we said, this is a -- in the universe of $2 billion, the universe of potential sales is bigger. Some of them might be partial sale down. And we really think that's the best way to reallocate our capital is to sell down places at a lower rate of return to invest in higher return projects.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And would Solar be included in that?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","If we sold down Solar, it would be part of that potential pool.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then specifically on the cost cutting, you talked about, obviously, upping the expectations here. That's strictly at an SG&A at the AES corporate level. Is there another bucket here to be expected over time more at the SBU level at the businesses themselves?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Here to clarify, I mean, what Tom talked about was sort of global G&A going from really what we have sort of, let's say, in our P&L statement, and that's where we started because we wanted to be extremely transparent and help you track it. Now we're going to go beyond that and we do have efforts -- so when we're talking about the $55 million, it's looking at, for example, our hubs, how we handle our SBUs, that overheads will be included in it. Of course, we'll have other cost-saving efforts that beyond that, beyond that $55 million. Perhaps, Andy, can give a little color on that.","Andrew Martin Vesley","Julien, it's Andy Vesley. I think it's -- the question is that part of the target that we set with the $55 million does include a significant amount of G&A that we record as cost of goods sold in the businesses. So we're already starting to get into the SBUs. I think, as you know, we've had a very significant cost reduction program in Brazil. We've had it ongoing for 3 years, and we're starting to take some of those best practices more broadly into our businesses. We also, in '13, as part of going into the ESP, are focused specifically at DP&L to get those costs in line as well. What I can say, the same amount of attention that has been brought to G&A globally, we will bring to the fixed costs in the business. It's a very big bucket, as you know. And I think as we head into next year and our plans solidify, we will update everybody on our objectives there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then lastly, with regards to the dividend, I mean, just curious, what's the pace at which you get to this target range broadly speaking? And even within that, I mean, how do you think about this on a multi-year basis, particularly given the disproportionate growth in your cash flow? And maybe even specific to that, can you talk about what the growth CAGR and the cash flows are in these near years, given that it's potentially higher than your EPS?","Andrew Martin Vesley","First, what we've said is that, we said we have a dividend policy of paying 30% to 40% of our Parent free cash flow. So what we're doing is basically bringing our dividend payment in line with our stated policy, and that's what we will do. So what you can expect is it will between 30% and 40% of that number. And as that number grows over time, we will increase the dividend accordingly. Now of course, there's a range between 30% and 40%, but now we're within that range. I don't think we're, at this stage, ready to talk about sort of a CAGR or the growth rate on the cash.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Julien, the only thing I'd add is that if we're looking at a 4% to 6% EPS growth through '15, we call that mid-single digits, we would be looking at something in a high-single digits for a Parent free cash flow kind of CAGR. So that's an order of magnitude.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","A couple of things I wanted to clarify. First, very near term. I mean, my sense was, given the hydro condition, as you point out, was still a bit of a negative in the third quarter, won't be that big of a negative in the fourth quarter. Then when I look at the earnings mix for the company in the second half, seemed to me it was more skewed towards fourth quarter versus third quarter. You reported $0.39 in the third quarter, putting you at $1.01 for the 9 months. I'm just curious why, given that assumption, you wouldn't be at or even above, certainly above the high end of the earnings guidance range? What am I missing there?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Tax. So that's really the equalizer.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Tax in the fourth quarter will be higher and will be an...","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Correct. Ali, our general tax rate, if you just think about over a long-term basis, is more in the 30%, 32%. So that's the kind of number that would come in the fourth quarter, so you have -- weighted average that in and that would factor in the delta.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, on the slightly longer-term earnings outlook, Tom, you mentioned, you've got the $0.05 of additional cost savings, getting offset by lower Brazil assumptions. But at the same time, you do have -- as you said, your free cash flow is growing stronger at the higher end, you've got additional asset sale proceeds coming, so I don't know if you assumed any use in terms of buybacks going forward. But I'm just curious, when we look at that 4% to 6% CAGR through 2015 and also sort of throwing in there, Andres, your aspiration of getting back to 6% to 8%, are we getting to the high end of that? I mean, what's holding us back to -- if not getting to 6% to 8%, maybe getting to 6%, given all the positives you've talked about today?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes. Well, I'll hit it first and Andres may want to give some color, too. But I'll just say, we expect to give some more color on '15 in February. We're just trying to give folks updates on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think what we have seen is clearly the cost savings are about $0.05. There's a lot of other puts and takes, but net, net, so far, the puts are equaling about the takes. I used Brazil, not to say it's the only moving part, but it's an example of a moving part that is almost a direct offset to the cost benefits, but there's obviously things that are going positively, a number of things that we're trying to make more positive, but some things that go off in a different direction. So that's just the short-term update for '15, but we expect to give you more color in February. Andres probably has some other thoughts.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Ali, there are some conservative assumptions in terms of allocation of capital in the numbers in terms of our growth rate of 4% to 6%. Now I did mention on this call and the prior call, we are looking at ways to increase that growth rate. We want to get back to the 6% to 8% range. And that's why I'm mentioning, for example, the enhancements and the adjacencies, because right now, these are small and we don't know how much we can -- how a big a pie it can be. But we're seeing very healthy returns from these, and we think they're much lower risk-adjusted because you have the assets, so it's adding something onto the asset. So we've done a number of them. The returns are healthy, the construction times are lower and that's one of the ways that we're trying to increase our growth rate. But right now, I mean, I think it's far too early to say that we have these in the bag. So just letting you know that we are doing everything possible to get back to that 6% to 8%, and these are some of the things that we see more attractive, also like bringing partners onto our projects, we can get a promote, we can get a management fee and these are not insubstantial. I mean, this year, we've signed deals for $500 million at the project level. So this is new approaches. We're being aggressive on this. But again, we're not willing to talk about its effect yet until we really are sure that they are sufficiently big to move the needle.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So last question, just to clarify that, Andres, I mean, the time frame we are still looking at is '12 through '15. '13 is pretty much behind us. So in effect, we're looking at '14 and '15. And if I'm hearing you right, given some of the stuff that you're working on, you still think that through '15 on a compound annual basis, you could get to 6% to 8%, even though right now, you're looking at 4% to 6%. Am I hearing that right?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Not exactly. What I'd say, we're reaffirming our guidance of 4% to 6% and total return of 6% to 8%, and we're comfortable with that. Of course, these projects that we're looking at and, of course, we have to see how many of them are, in addition to the big platform expansions that we're doing, including to the sell downs on top of this, the company doesn't end in 2015, so we're going to be looking at an ongoing growth rate. So quite frankly, our focus is on making sure that we create as much shareholder value. We did give targets out for 2015. We are committed to hitting them. But we're also committing to having a strong ongoing company and making sure that we have good growth rates after that as well.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So your 6% to 8% aspiration doesn't necessarily take the '15 period. It may be over a longer period.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","As I've said, we are sticking to our 4% to 6% and we're doing everything possible to increase that. And again, our objective is not only at the '15 number, but beyond as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","This is Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Your new partner for Alto Maipo, will that mining company also take a large percentage of the output of that plant?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. Definitely, the partner, which is Antofagasta Minerals, will be a major offtaker to that contract for making the financing -- so it'll take roughly about, I'd say, 1\/3 of the output. Realize that this is a run-of-the-river, so there is considerable seasonality to it. So it's a constant contract. So we're contracted at the correct level, and we expect many years to have access to sell into the market.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I didn't hear you say anything about your big coal plant under construction in Vietnam. Is that still on schedule, on budget?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, yes. I'm glad that you mentioned that. Mong Duong, that's proceeding very nicely, and that's part of the -- a big part of the 2,231-megawatts under construction that are on time and on budget.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. and then when you say your expectations for China -- for Asia next year are down, I would've thought that the full impact of the Masinloc contract would've passed. I mean, because you redid that contract roughly a year ago, I think. And then also, the divestiture of the China assets, wouldn't that all be behind you by next year, that things would be flat, flattish, or am I missing...","Thomas M. O'Flynn","This is Tom. I think my comment was just talking about the difference between '13 and '12. So '12, China was the difference. But the biggest difference really was that last year in '12, we still had some of our Masinloc output sold into the spot market. The spot market was quite good last year. We signed a new 7-year contract that took effect this January. Those prices are somewhat below the higher spot prices from last year, but we saw it as a very favorable thing to do because it gave us a lot of stability through 2019. So it's modesty lower revenues, but with much greater predictability that we felt was a good trade that does explain the difference.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So I misunderstood that '14 -- you didn't say '14 would be down in Asia...","Thomas M. O'Flynn","No, my comments were '12 to '13. You're right, '13 to '14 should be pretty flat, and then Mong Duong comes in Q4 '15 and thereafter, Mong Duong will start to add. But '13 versus '14 in Asia should be pretty flat.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Brian Russo.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Could you just comment on the Tiet\u00ea Eletropaulo contract expiration at the end of '15, and kind of where you see pricing in '16? And then maybe considering that's likely to be a headwind, if you could maybe talk about some of the growth projects that could be positive drivers of post '15. And then the 572 megawatts that should be completed in '16, what's the equity investment in that?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Sure. As you know, yes, we do have a cliff at Tiet\u00ea with the expiration of the contract with Eletropaulo. And the drop in prices is somewhere around BRL 195, around BRL 130, in that range. We have 2 developing projects in S\u00e3o Paulo, which is Termo Araraquara and Termo S\u00e0o Paulo. We really haven't been able to participate in the energy auctions in Brazil because we haven't been able to secure a supply of gas. There isn't gas available, so that had been sort of slowing us down to build it using some of Tiet\u00ea's capacity to build new plants. So what the team has been doing in Brazil is developing a commercial arm and selling some of this energy forward to, let's say, to be ready to place this energy when this occurs. Now I'm actually very happy that we did not go ahead, let's say, and rush into, try to fill this drop in Tiet\u00ea because you've seen what happened to asset prices in Brazil. So I think we think we've taken a very prudent approach. And if we didn't see value, we did not invest. Andy, you want to...","Andrew Martin Vesley","Yes, Brian, Andy Vesley. I think the only thing I would add is just give you a status on that because this is something obviously that we're actively managing. When we think about Tiet\u00ea, there's about 1,200 megawatts of firm physical capacity to bring to market in the contract. And we've -- as of this date, 400 megawatts is already secured under contracts for deliveries starting when the EP contract rolls out. What's the good news is, is that we continue to see that market strengthening and power pricing going up. As you may remember, after the MP 579 intervention by the government, there was this great view that the whole markets would collapse and the pricing was really questionable. But given what we've been seeing, the need for more thermal capacity, the slowdowns in some of the large hydro projects, we anticipate actually a strengthening of these markets. So while we don't believe we will be able to re-contract at the levels we're contracted at now with EP, we think we have been pretty strategic in bringing the rest of this capacity to market, and this is something that we're working very diligently with the corporation. So Tom, I don't know if you would want to add anything to that?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Okay.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","And just lastly, the 572 megawatts that are going to be completed in 2016, any idea what the equity investment in that is?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","You're talking about...","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","On Slide 32, you've got 572 megawatts?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","In '15?","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","In '16.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","In '16, Cochrane is the project in 2016. I think our equity is roughly $200 million.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Brian Chin.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a longer-term opportunity question. When you talk about Indianapolis Power & Light in the $511 million investment of IPL from MATS compliance, some other utilities talk fairly frequently about coal combustion residuals, effluent limitations, guidelines, but other requirements besides just MATS, will the $511 million investment in IPL cover most of those other environmental requirements? Or can you talk a little bit about what other opportunities for growth are there at IPL for other types of environmental spending beyond just MATS?","Andrew Martin Vesley","Yes, Brian, this is Andy Vesley. Let me sort of address that. The $511 million is really the hazardous air toxic, so it doesn't cover some of the others. Some of the others which you have the 316(b), you have water effluents, the NPDES and the coal combustion residuals. If we look at IPL roughly in terms of investments and also, if you think about the national ambient air quality standards, which are actually in the development, you could be talking about another $300 million to $400 million, in that range. I don't have -- on average. So it probably is a doubling of what we're spending on the MATS out into the future, so that's about what we're looking at, and those are the significant ones that we see on the horizon that would impact our coal plants in Indiana.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then second question also on longer-term growth. A number of other U.S. utilities in the Midwest are talking a little bit more aggressively about transmission and distribution on the project. I think even Dynegy was talking a little bit of that today, this morning. Haven't really heard a whole lot of transmission and distribution growth outlooks or opportunities for either Indianapolis Power & Light of Dayton Power. Can you talk about those a little bit?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, I can at a high level. I mean let's start with Dayton. I mean, Dayton has some transmission-related investments, but they're not, what I would call, very significant. On average at DP&L and the wireless business collectively, we're probably about spending $150 million, $155 million a year. We don't have mega transmission projects. We don't have that opportunity. At DP&L, really, there is a Senate Bill 560 in Indiana, which is the sort of a way to what's really was developed for the gas industry as a way of upgrading their infrastructure. When we look at IPL, as you know, we have one of the highest reliability in the State. We've actually done a very good job at maintaining our system. So we don't see, again, these huge opportunities for massive infrastructure projects. But when we think about it, on a normalized basis, in our wires business in Indiana, we're talking about an $85 million a year ongoing investment. But again, at the moment, and this can change as we take a closer look into next year, we don't really see any of these very big opportunities to make massive upgrades in the wires businesses or new transmission investments in Ohio. So that opportunity doesn't appear to be there, but it's something we continue to look at.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Raymond Leung.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just Tom, I think you -- or Andres, you mentioned that you're happy with the leverage at the Parent level. Can you talk a little bit about, with leverage remaining fairly flat, what do you think is the optimal Parent distribution to debt number? You're roughly below 4.5x. I think in the past, you've talked about 5, 5.5x. So how should we think about that, first of all?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. I think we're in -- you're fair in terms of about 4.5x. We see our debt level as being reasonable with our existing asset portfolio. We think our coverage ratios will improve as our cash flow improves for the reasons that we talked about, both in the script as well as on a couple of the questions. So we think that we'll have an improving credit profile over the next 2 to 3 years through improving the, let's say, the numerator of our coverage ratio as opposed to the interest expense in the denominator, or the debt amount in the denominator. Obviously, that can change to the extent there are changes in the portfolio. So when we do sell assets, we generally look to be credit-neutral with the use of proceeds. Ballpark, that's using about half of the money to retire Parent debt, but it's dependent upon cash flow. Obviously, the more cash flow that would be generated by an asset, then the more you would pay down debt to be credit-neutral. And then growth would flip into the other way to the extent we're getting more growth out of business, longer cash flow in Gener and Mong Duong, which are 2 investment entities and IPL will all be significant cash flow growth entities. And that would be part of the cash flow improvement story.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","And Raymond, there's also a qualitative environment as we go forward. So if you look where we're investing in our portfolio and cash flows are growing and where we're exiting, over time, I think we also can say we're improving the average quality of our cash flow and our portfolio. So that's another important contributor.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Now I guess your midpoint for Parent distributions or sub-distributions for Parent is like $1.2 billion or so. I mean, directionally, you have new projects coming online. Should we think of that as growing -- continuing to grow or improve or remains relatively steady?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","We do expect that to grow over time, and we have big projects like Mong Duong coming online. So we expect a growth in that as well.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just another question, more subsidiary level in U.S. ops. You talked a little bit about potential cost savings. It seemed like, that was a pretty eminent item in the DP&L, ESP order. What are you guys thinking in terms of cost reductions over at DPL? And to a lesser extent, maybe if there's any opportunities at IPALCO, what you guys are thinking there in terms of cost savings?","Andrew Martin Vesley","Again, this is Andy Vesley. When we think about the NOx [ph], that was one that was right in front of us. A number of calls ago, we had said that the 3 levers for managing Dayton Power & Light, we're getting constructive regulatory outcome, so we're past that and we believe we did to some degree. The other was our -- basically our retail arm to protect our load and also make sure we could get our generation to market. And the answer on that one is, we have about 100,000 more customers under DP&L brand and we had when we acquired the company and we have about the same load. And the last one is the cost one. We had talked about a $60 million target to date through '13. We've identified about $31 million. We've taken out half of that roughly when O&M reductions, the other half when variable margin improvements, such as heat rate improvements and improve the acquisition of coal and some others, change in coal mix. What the order had left us with was, in order to get back to where we think we need, there's another $20 million to $30 million of cost reductions, which we are identifying and plan to deliver. So I think the opportunity, at least in the near term, is to bring another $20 million to $30 million of cost savings to that business in the near term. As I said earlier, that almost simultaneously, we are looking broadly at the full fixed cost of all our operating businesses, which is about something probably $3 billion. So it provides a great opportunity, and as I said, we're going to look very hard at that and talk more about that as we get into the next year.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just lastly on DPL, on the capital structure, I think at your Analyst Day, you talked about reducing debt by about $225 million at DPL. Can you sort of give us an update where you stood on that? It looked like you had about $2.8 billion of debt there, with almost $560 million of cash. But maybe, if you walk me through where you guys are with the debt reduction program there?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, the cash may be that we refinanced over the quarter end. We raised some money and I think we had a maturity on October 1 or the first few days of October. So our cash probably really looks heavy, but that was just for a couple of days. But generally, you're right, we have paid down $250 million of debt this year, and we would expect -- I think our debt at DP&L is reasonably solid. It's above $800 million, $850 million kind of range. But up at PUCO we have about $1.4 billion, and we would expect to pay down -- as I've said, $250 million this year is largely done, but we'd expect to have the ability to pay down $50 million to $70 million or so a year, largely with our new bank agreement.","Raymond M. Leung - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","$50 million to $70 million per year. And that's based on the latest ESP?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes.","Ahmed Pasha","Sure. Veronica, can we take last question, please?","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions, sir.","Ahmed Pasha","Okay. We thank everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing many of you at the conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] And I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Pasha, you may begin.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Elan. Good morning, and welcome to the second quarter 2014 earnings call for The AES Corporation. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Today I will provide a brief update on our second quarter results and our progress on executing our strategic plan.","Turning to Slide 4. Our second quarter results were $0.28 of adjusted earnings per share, which keeps us in line to achieve the low end of our guidance range on EPS despite the continuation of the drought in Brazil and Panama. Tom will provide more details on our results today and our year-to-go forecast, but a major driver of lower earnings in the second quarter was a much higher tax rate, which we expect will normalize on a full year basis. Similarly, while our cash flow results to date are significantly below last year's, this is largely due to timing issues at our utility. And we continue to expect to achieve our full year guidance.","Now turning to the progress we are making on executing our strategic plan. I am pleased with our results to date. As you can see on Slide 5, the main objectives we set out almost 3 years ago were: first, exiting those markets where we do not have a competitive advantage; second, focusing our growth on platform expansions; and third, reducing our overhead. Since then, we've added a fourth objective, to expand our access to capital through partnerships at the project and business level.","Taking one objective at a time, turning to Slide 6 and the simplification of our portfolio. In the second quarter, we announced and closed 2 new asset sale transactions. First, we brought in a minority partner for 41% of our Masinloc business in the Philippines. Second, we announced the sale of a majority of our solar business, Silver Ridge, which was not yielding adequate risk-adjusted returns on our invested capital. These 2 new transactions together represent $631 million of proceeds, implying a P\/E multiple of more than 14 from these businesses and in line with our expectation of achieving $500 million to $700 million in asset sale proceeds in 2014 and 2015. Since we began the simplification of our portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2011, we have received $2 billion in asset sale proceeds, which we have used to pay down 20% of our recourse debt, buy back 8% of our stock and invest in platform expansions. Going forward, we expect to raise $500 million in additional proceeds by December 2015, by selling all or part of our interests in certain businesses in markets where we want to exit, decrease our exposure or reinvest our capital in platform expansions. What we seek to do is optimize our portfolio by geography, technology and fuel source.","Turning to Slide 7. With regard to our focus on platform expansions, which provide us with a path for growth with higher risk-adjusted returns. We now have 4,500 megawatts of new capacity and 2,400 megawatts of environmental upgrades under construction. Most of these projects are either under long-term contracts or will earn utility-like returns. This is the greatest number of megawatts under construction ever in AES' 33-year history.","As you can see on Slide 8, we've achieved commercial operations on time and on budget at the 247 megawatt IPP4 power plant in Jordan, which has a long-term contract with a state-owned utility. We also recently broke ground on 3 new platform expansion projects in the second quarter totaling 702 megawatts in the U.S. and Chile. The 671 megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT at IPL will not only help us diversify the fuel mix at the utility, but will also earn attractive regulated returns beginning during construction. This investment, combined with the mass upgrade currently underway, will result in a 50% increase in IPL's rate base. We see additional investment opportunities at IPL, which will help further grow the earnings power of this utility.","In Northern Chile in the Atacama Desert, which has some of the best solar irradiation in the world, we recently broke ground on a 21 megawatt solar project with a long-term PPA with a local mine. Including this project under construction, we are developing a total of 220 megawatts of solar capacity next to our existing Los Andes substation. The entire capacity has environmental approval and will be developed in stages.","Turning to Slide 9. The investment in our construction program will be mostly funded through nonrecourse debt and by our partners on various projects. Our total equity contribution in these projects is approximately $1.5 billion, of which we've already funded more than $1 billion and expect to invest the remaining $450 million, largely in 2015 and 2016. We expect a 16% cash return and a 15% ROE on these investments, which will be an important driver of earnings and cash flow growth over the next few years. Furthermore, we're making progress on our advanced pipeline of development projects, including platform expansions, adjacencies and enhancements and select platform expansion acquisitions. These opportunities represent a pipeline of more than 5,000 megawatts in our core markets.","Turning to Slide 10. We have significant brownfield potential at our Southland gas-fired facilities in Southern California. We're moving through the permitting process and pursuing long-term PPAs and commercial arrangements. Furthermore, our energy storage solution and site locations position us well to help meet Californian's mandate for at least 1,325 megawatts of energy storage.","Turning to Slide 11. As we discussed in our last call, we are closing the cycle at our 236 megawatt DPP plant in the Dominican Republic, increasing its capacity by 122 megawatts. We recently signed a 6-year PPA with the state-owned utility and selected an EPC contractor. We are working on financing and expect to begin construction later this year with commercial operations in mid-2016. This 260 megawatt enhancement will be mostly funded with debt capacity in the Dominican Republic.","Moving to Slide 12. Another market where we're looking at growth opportunities is Mexico. We've been in Mexico for almost 15 years and currently own 3 power plants, making us one of the largest independent power producers in the country. Mexico is a big market, and more importantly, has the potential to increase its installed capacity by more than 25,000 megawatts in the next 5 to 7 years through recently proposed reforms to the energy laws.","Now on to Asia beginning on Slide 13. As you may know, the Philippines is currently experiencing power shortages as growing demand continues to exceed existing supply. We already have all the necessary permits for the 600 megawatt Masinloc expansion, and we're working to secure EPC and power offtake agreements. We're also developing up to 200-megawatts of energy storage projects to meet ancillary service requirements and peak demand needs for the system.","Turning to Slide 14. In Vietnam, construction of our 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project is progressing well. We recently synchronized to the national grid and achieved full load on unit 1 of 560 megawatts. We expect to achieve full commercial operations on time during the second half of 2015. In its first full year of operations, we expect Mong Duong to contribute $100 million in proportional free cash flow. In addition to our Mong Duong facility, we're assessing further growth opportunities in Vietnam, including both greenfield and privatization of government-owned generation plants.","Turning to Slide 15. A significant development that aids the execution of our strategy is our ability to incorporate financial partners at the project and business level. Since we started this initiative 2 years ago, we have closed about $2 billion in equity from partners. Bringing in partners at the project level enables us to optimize our portfolio by tailoring our equity commitments to specific projects managing our aggregate risk profile at the corporate level and improving our returns through promotes and management fees. It also gives us a mechanism to demonstrate the value of our assets in markets where there are few or no listed comps. Some recent examples of these are Guacolda in Chile where we brought in a partner to invest $728 million for a 50% stake in the business; and Masinloc in the Philippines where EGCO, a Thai company, invested $453 million for a 41% stake.","Now addressing our third objective on Slide 16, reducing our global overhead to become the low-cost manager of a portfolio of assets. We are well on our way. We're on track to realize our goal of reducing global overhead by $200 million by 2015. From 2011 to 2013, we reduced our global overhead by $143 million, and we expect to achieve an additional $57 million over the next 1.5 years. I'm pleased to report that we have accelerated our savings profile and now expect to realize about 70% or $40 million in savings this year, leaving only $17 million to be achieved in 2015. We're accomplishing these reductions through process improvements and global standardization across our corporate support functions. Therefore, in terms of executing on our strategic plan to increase shareholder value by creating a more streamlined and focused company, which takes advantage of its footprint in attractive markets to pursue high-return projects, I would say we are continuing to make very good progress. Nonetheless, we're facing some short-term challenges in a few of our markets.","Moving to Slide 17. This is the second year of drought in Latin America, which has significantly affected our results in Panama and Brazil. As we discussed on our last call, we continue to project an earnings impact of $0.07 to $0.10 in 2014.","Turning to Slide 18 in Brazil where we continue to see tight demand and supply conditions having a positive impact on forward power prices, which are now BRL 180 to BRL 210 per megawatt hour for 2016. As you may know, this is about the same price of Tiet\u00ea's existing contract that expires in 2015 and is almost 50% higher than the price we assumed in our expectations for 2016. 3\/4 of Tiet\u00ea's capacity for 2016 is contracted for 2016 at BRL 125 per megawatt hour. And with today's forward curves, we see $0.01 to $0.02 upside for adjusted EPS in 2016 relative to our expectations. Beyond 2016, on an unhedged basis, every BRL 10 improvement in power prices translates into $0.01 of adjusted EPS for AES.","Turning to Slide 19, I will discuss developments at Maritza, our coal-fired power plant in Bulgaria. In June, the Bulgarian energy regulator took certain actions concerning Maritza's PPA. The regulator announced that it had requested the Director General for Competition of the European Commission to scrutinize the PPA under European state aid rules. While the Director General has not contacted us on this matter, Maritza will defend the PPA in any assessment or proceedings initiated in response to this request. Additionally, as we've discussed in the past, the energy regulator has instructed NEK, the state-owned utility that is the offtaker under our contract, to initiate negotiations on the terms of the PPA in order to lower its payments. We have had several discussions with NEK and various government authorities concerning the regulator's actions.","Maritza continues to be engaged in resolving this matter, as well as in the recovery of our outstanding receivables. In fact, last week, Maritza signed an agreement to settle $45 million of its outstanding receivables that are more than 90 days overdue from NEK. In that deal, NEK agreed to assume $17 million representing all of Maritza's outstanding obligations to its fuel supplier and restructured the additional amount over 4 months. As of July 31, Maritza had $206 million of receivables due from NEK with $47 million not yet due and $69 million overdue for more than 90 days. As far as the resolution of these issues, it is likely that any action will be deferred until the new government is elected in October. Maritza contributes roughly 7% of our PTC. And while the situation is challenging, Maritza's objective is to preserve the value of the business through a negotiated agreement of our seeking to reinforce its rights. Our guidance is based on maintaining the value of our existing contract.","Next turning to Slide 20. Although we have not been negatively affected by the Argentine government's selected defaults, we continue to closely monitor the situation. In Argentina, where we generate about 3% of our PTC, we have a competitive fleet of 3,000 megawatts of generation capacity, which is an important source of reliable generation in the country. Additionally, we have taken steps to dollarize our accounts receivables in Argentina. Although we have factored a devaluation of the Argentine peso into our forecast, an extreme devaluation could have negative impacts on our results.","And finally, turning to the situation in Puerto Rico where our 524 megawatt coal-fired plant has a long-term contract with PREPA, a government-owned utility. As you may know, the rating agencies lowered the rating on the commonwealth and its corporations. AES Puerto Rico contributes about 2% of our PTC. PREPA is facing business and liquidity challenges primarily driven by the weak economy, along with other state-owned companies and has a high cost oil-fired generation fleet that serves 70% of the commonwealth's energy needs. We believe that our existing contract is advantageous to PREPA, particularly considering that our plant saves PREPA an estimated $250 million per year.","These are some of the key areas that we're keeping a close eye on. Having said that, we have taken actions and will continue to do so in order to mitigate any risks. In the longer term, we're addressing our exposure through selective asset sell-downs and rebalancing our fuel mix through platform expansions to create an even more robust company.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom, who will provide more details on our financial results in the second quarter and year-to-date, as well as our year-to-go forecast.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll go through our second quarter results including adjusted EPS, adjusted PTC by strategic business unit or SBU, proportional free cash flow, the 2014 capital allocation plan, and finally, our 2014 guidance.","Beginning on Slide 22. This quarter, we benefited from higher pretax contributions from our businesses and also our capital allocation impacts. However, the tax rate in the second quarter was higher than last year and above our full year 2014 expectations. We finished the quarter with adjusted EPS of $0.28 a share and expect to achieve adjusted EPS in the low end of our guidance range. Improvements in our businesses in the U.S., Andes, Brazil and also in Mexico, Central America and Caribbean SBUs together contributed an increase of $0.02, including a lower adverse impact from hydrology versus last year. Partially offsetting these improvements, outages in our Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia SBUs reduced results by $0.02. Like last year, we recognized benefits from some discrete items, the net effect of which was a positive $0.02.","We also benefited from investing in our balance sheet, which added $0.02 to the bottom line. This was driven by 2 factors: First, our share count was down by 3%; and second, in May of 2013, we prepaid $300 million of parent debt and refinanced $750 million, which resulted in annual interest expense reduction of $50 million.","Our tax rate was 40% this quarter, higher than last year's second quarter's unusually low rate of 11% producing a negative impact of $0.11. This breaks down into $0.07 related to the expected return to a normalized rate of about 30% to 32% and $0.04 due to interim timing impacts.","Before I go into the businesses, I'd like to touch on some developments at DPL on Slide 23. The commission has ruled on all pending matters in the ESP case and extended the generation separation deadline by 12 months to January 2017. Regarding generation separation, based on the PUCO staff's recent comments, we believe we are close to a consensus with the staff on material terms of separation. We expect a commission decision in the third quarter. As you may know, we ran a process to consider selling DPL generation. Although the sale would have been accretive this year, and we received reasonable bids. The offers were not attractive relative to the long-term value to AES. We therefore decided not to sell. Selling the generation would have left the remaining business with a significant amount of debt. At the same time, this high debt level increases our leverage to improvements in the energy market.","The following factors contributed to our decision: first, movements in power prices as witnessed in the first half of this year create a more positive outlook. I appreciate these curves would come off their May peaks, however, the market is still higher than what we were projecting at the start of the year. Second, we saw an improvement in PJM RPM prices which doubled, albeit from low level at the last auction and outstanding proposals to provide additional improvement. Third, we are implementing a plan to further improve the operations of the business, particularly related to improved plant performance. And fourth, we'll continue to optimize our positions through our multiyear commercial hedging strategy.","Overall through 2016 when the ESP expires, DPL is expected to generate annual EBITDA of about $350 million, of which about $80 million to $100 million is attributable to the generation business with the rest coming from the T&D business and the non-bypassable payments under the current ESP. Based on current forwards, DPL is projected to generate $100 million in free cash flow annually. And our plan is to use any excess cash to repay debt, which is currently $2.3 billion. We provided addition details on hedging and debt maturity profiles of DPL in the appendix.","Bottom line is that DPL's generation business was projected to be dilutive over the next several years. However, based on the current market, this business is earnings neutral and has earnings upside potential if we're successful in capturing the market and operating improvements that I just discussed.","Now to Slide 24, I'll discuss each of our SBUs, focusing on adjusted PTC or PTC. In the U.S., we reported an increase of $17 million of PTC. This was largely driven by the synchronous condensers at Southland and a new 40 megawatt energy storage resource in Ohio. In our Andes SBU, PTC was up $16 million. We benefited from a higher tariff at AES Argentina and lower maintenance costs and lower FX losses in Chile.","In Brazil, PTC increased $37 million for the quarter. This includes a $47 million benefit at Sul from a reversal of a prior interest expense. This compares to a $24 million reversal of a liability at Uruguaiana in the second quarter of last year. Excluding these onetime items, PTC increased by $14 million as we benefited from higher contributions at Uruguaiana and Sul.","Moving to Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, PTC declined $9 million. We benefited from the steps that were taken to offset the adverse hydro conditions in Panama, including payment from the government under the negotiated agreement to compensate for exposure to high spot prices of up to $40 million this year and $100 million total from 2014 to 2016.","Turning to Europe, Middle East and Africa on Slide 25. PTC was essentially flat versus last year. This performance was largely driven by scheduled outages in Bulgaria that were offset by higher operating performance at Kilroot in U.K. and a reversal of a liability in Kazakhstan.","Finally to Asia, where PTC declined by $17 million. Although we were anticipating a decline, our operations in the Philippines were adversely affected by forced outages in the second quarter with an impact of $13 million. These outages are the result of issues in the boiler, which have been resolved and the units were returned to service in July. In addition, we used these outages to complete some maintenance we had planned for next year.","So to summarize, as shown on Slide 26, our total year-to-date adjusted PTC is roughly $583 million or 43% of the midpoint of our expectations. For comparison, last year, we earned 46% of our full year PTC in the first half. Our year-to-date effective tax rate was 36%. We expect a lower rate during the second half of the year that will bring our full year tax rate down to about 30% to 32%. Beyond this year, we continue to expect a low to mid-30% tax rate.","Now to cash flow on Slide 27, we generated $47 million of proportional free cash flow in the second quarter, which was impacted by working capital requirements at our utilities in Brazil. This brings our year-to-date proportional free cash flow to $176 million versus $526 million in the first 6 months of '13. We recognize that this year is significantly lower than last year as we've had a $300 million swing at our utilities in the U.S. and Brazil driven primarily by working capital requirements. Specifically, in Brazil as we discussed on our last call, the system operators dispatching thermal generation to preserve reservoir levels causing higher spot prices. These higher spot prices do not affect our utility earnings due to the passive nature of energy purchases. However, there is an adverse impact on working capital as there was a lag due to the periodic tariff adjustments approved on an annual basis. Our guidance assumes that during the second half of the year, our utilities in Brazil will benefit from the recently approved annual tariff adjustments, as well as the pending government support mechanisms.","In the U.S., during the first half of the year, cash flow at DPL and IPL were affected by higher working capital requirements, outages at DPL and upfront funding of annual pension contributions at IPL. Working capital requirements at our U.S. utilities were driven by high receivables from our regulated customers as a result of higher fuel prices and energy purchases during the cold weather in the first quarter. Our guidance assumes that both companies will recover these investments through fuel and energy cost regulatory mechanisms during the second half of the year.","To summarize, with our year-to-date performance, we expect to generate almost $1 billion in proportional free cash flow during the second half of this year versus $745 million generated in the second half of last year. We do have seasonality in our cash flow. Last year, the second half represented 59% of our proportional free cash flow. This year, in addition to the seasonality factor in the second half, we expect to recover the significant short-term working capital drag that I just discussed. In fact, our utilities in the U.S. and Brazil should contribute about $400 million in the second half of the year versus negative $100 million in the first half. We believe proportional free cash flow is one of our key value drivers. We continue to believe that we'll generate $1 billion to $1.3 billion this year, and we're very focused on our businesses having a strong second half to achieve this goal.","Now to Slide 28 in our capital allocation plan for the year. During the quarter, we refinanced a $770 million senior secured term loan with an unsecured floating rate note, increasing our available first-lien debt capacity by 50% to $2.2 billion and reducing our interest expense. When taking into account the recently announced solar and Philippines transactions, we project roughly $1.5 billion of discretionary cash, including about $800 million of cash from announced asset sales as well as parent-free cash flow, which we expect to be $500 million.","We've allocated about $275 million this year for investment in a portion of our equity commitments for projects under construction, primarily platform expansions. We used roughly $500 million to $600 million of the excess cash for debt reduction, including the $320 million that we recently called and the $140 million prepaid earlier this year. About half the targeted debt reduction this year relates to our policy of using part of the proceeds from asset sales to maintain credit neutrality. The remaining half was discretionary in an effort to accelerate our credit improvement and reduce financial risks, consistent with our previously stated balanced capital allocation strategy.","Since our first quarter call in May, we've invested $47 million in our shares. This brings our overall investment in share repurchases to $758 million since September of 2011, reducing our share count by 8%. After $145 million of dividends to shareholders and a target closing cash balance of $100 million, we're projecting $300 million to $500 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year, plus any additional asset sales would increase the amount available.","In the first half of the year, our allocation of capital to share repurchases has been modest, as we've been more focused on reducing our debt and making investments, that will earn attractive returns and generate growth in our earnings and cash flow. Over the past 2 years, however, we've been returning approximately $400 million per year on average to shareholders, including dividends and repurchases. This year, we anticipate returning at least $300 million as we expect to repurchase more shares in the second half. The bottom line is that we'll continue to be disciplined and invest our cash to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders on a per-share basis.","Now to Slide 29. We are reaffirming our guidance that we expect to be in the low end of our adjusted EPS range of $1.30 to $1.38. In the first quarter call when we updated our guidance, we discussed several items that we expect that will help us to mitigate the $0.07 to $0.10 impact of hydrology. One of these offsets was an expectation of the benefits from selling DPL's generation business and removing it from continuing operations this year. Although we decided to retain this business, and therefore, will not have that benefit this year, the Sul reversal that I talked about earlier, which was not in our original guidance, allows us to stay within the low end of our guidance range.","With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Tom. In summary, although we're facing some short-term headwinds, we're taking concrete steps to lower our portfolio risks and increase per-share value. Since we set out our strategy in September 2011, we're on target to reduce our global overhead by $200 million by next year, and we are focusing on additional O&M cost reductions. We raised $2 billion in asset sale proceeds. We paid down 20% of our parent debt; invested $758 million in our shares, reducing our share count by 8%; and we are selectively investing in platform expansion opportunities that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns. Through these actions, we've laid a solid foundation and remain committed to investing our excess cash flow to grow our earnings and free cash flow per share, resulting in proportional free cash flow growth of 10% to 15% per year and a total return to shareholders of 8% to 10% by 2017.","Now, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Ali Agha.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just following-up on a few of the topics, first off on the capital allocation front. So if I looked at on the slide, this quarter versus last quarter, it appears you've paid down about an another $390 odd million of debt or plan to do that in terms of -- in terms of that bucket. What are the earnings implications of that, or have those been factored in from that incremental debt reduction?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, those are factored in, Ali.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","So is it fair to say the asset sale proceeds, the earnings going away from asset sales are being offset by the lower interest. Is that the way to think about that?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, I would say partially, yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then with regards to the unallocated bucket, and I know, Tom, you alluded to the fact you will be buying more shares in the second half, given that roughly 300 million or so number. Is there a thought of getting even more aggressive on the buyback given where the stock is, Andres? I mean just your thoughts on that, as you're investing in new projects versus buybacks looking at the valuations, how are you thinking about potentially getting even more aggressive on buybacks?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","That's a very good question, Ali. When we're looking at the investments that we're making, as I've said in the past, we compete that -- those against share buybacks. So obviously, when you look at the returns that we're projecting, 16% cash returns and a 15% ROE, we think that those are superior to what we're getting back from buybacks. So we're taking a balanced approach. We're saying that -- we said last time that we would buy back shares. We're doing that. Do realize that the cash that we received from these asset sales was also quite recent. We only received it, say, in the last month. But I think we're doing exactly what we said that we would do that we would buy back shares. But we'd also complete the new projects. And so obviously, if we're doing these new projects it's because we feel that those are the projects that maximize our shareholder value over time.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And then Andres, just coming back to DPL for a second. So the merchant, as you said, the pricing you thought was not good, so you pulled back on that sale. So should we view these assets now as core holdings and that sale is completely off the table? And related to that, as you know Duke is going through the similar process, and you do have joint ownership with them on a bunch of your plants. Would you look to participate through that joint ownership in the Duke process?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","You're right, Ali, one of the factors and one of the reasons we proceeded to go out and get a market read on these assets were that some of our partners were out there selling. And obviously, that will have an impact on these assets. It depends on who buys them, how they will be running these operations. So we will continue to closely monitor that process and see what ways we can continue to increase value there. I mean, as you know, we have a program to get more out of these plants from a performance point of view. Maybe Andy would like to just comment on some of the things we're doing there.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Thanks, Andres. We -- in keeping the plants, we have a few things that we're focusing it on, and I'll just talk to the 3. Obviously, we continue our cost reduction program. We've already achieved about $65 million in O&M reductions to date, which is currently in our forecast. We're also looking at 2 other things. One is reliability and improvements at the major stations. For our fleet at DPL, every 1% increase in -- decrease in E4 [ph] gives us about approximately $2 million of adjusted PTC. And also heat rate, which again on a fleet basis, every 1% improvement in heat rate gives us about $3 million to us. So we're focused on both of those programs. We have a lot of experience there, and we should start to see those improvement results in 2015. And lastly, one of the lessons we took away from last year's polar vortex was we really had to refocus on our commercial strategy in working with our risk flow. The operating people are trying to increase operational flexibility by improving the ability to turn down and be much more responsive to markets. So those 3 things we're going to pursue much more aggressively now. And we think we'll start to see the benefit of that in the 2015 timeframe.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","To sort of close the topic, also some of our other firms in Ohio are looking at, for example, PPAs and other things. so we're monitoring those things. And we took a decision based that we thought there was more upside at that price than selling it. It would have been a -- I think it shows our discipline in terms of executing on our strategy. I think all of our asset sales, we've executed quite well and really tried to get value from those assets. Even though sometimes we could have done things faster, I think we would have left some money on the table.","Operator","Our next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question here, could you reconcile a little bit what the assumptions are baked into your long-term growth rates? Specifically, I noticed you talk about a higher growth rate in '17, '18. What's embedded in there from both the DPL perspective as well as the hydro and recontracting perspective in Brazil?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I'm going to pass this question off to Tom. But I think that the basic assumptions -- what I can say in terms of the longer forecast -- I mean this is based on the projects that we have under construction today. A big factor is Mong Duong coming online next year, which will produce a lot of cash. We also have Alto Maipo. We have these 4,500 megawatts, which we're constructing. And in terms of the hydro in Brazil, we do assume a return to normal, but we are looking at higher contract prices.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Tom, were you going to add something?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes. Sorry, Julien. So the 5-year forecast, we look at it on an annual basis. That's when we talked in our year end call, we laid out. And that was based upon market assumptions at that time. So those were PJM forwards at that time and also Brazil numbers that were around, more like 115 at that time. So as we sit here today, DPL's probably up a couple of cents. And as Andres went through Tiet\u00ea, we'll probably be up a penny or 2 based upon the forward curves as we see them today. I think that said, we're reluctant to update 5-year guidance on a piece-by-piece basis. But just in isolation, those 2 things would be tailwinds for us. We would plan to give a wholesome 5 year update at the same time next year, which is in Feb when we announce our year end earnings.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And can you just reconcile a little bit on DPL. I think I heard you saying that it generates, perhaps, breakeven or even negative EPS prospectively. When would you think about next reevaluating this business? Is this really about waiting it out in terms of maturity and seeing what happens in terms of the market, or is it something else?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I think Julien, getting back to sort of our decision, this year it would have been accretive to sell DPL, as Tom pointed out in our last earnings call and mentioned today again. We think given current forward curves that it will be neutral to slightly accretive to have kept it going forward. Now in terms of -- we are always evaluating all of our businesses and updating it. But what I would say is that, as Tom mentioned in his speech, we're thinking about things very much in the portfolio and in terms of looking what's our aggregated risk at the corporate level. And so here, we're saying that basically, given the various factors that are happening in Ohio and the forward curves, we think there's potential upside from having kept Ohio. Of course, we have to always revalue our decisions over time.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I'll move on. On the D -- sorry, on the share repurchase side of the equation, when you're thinking about allocating the rest of the to-be-allocated capital on that pie chart, at what point in time could we see a potential revision in share repurchase? I know it's a little bit re-asking the last question, but I just want to be a little clearer about this.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","What I would say, Julien, is that again, we've said that we would buy shares at these prices, and we are doing so. And I don't think that at this stage, we have a number of interesting projects. And we also have the opportunity to pay down debt, which we've announced. I think we've -- Tom stated that we wanted to be a solid BB, and we're keeping our credit metrics within that range. So we'll maintain that balanced capital allocation, say, philosophy going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then could you talk a little bit about the expansions here? Again kind of with respect to the guidance there, I assume this isn't in there. But the Dominican Republic expansion, how much does that contribute in EPS? And then also Mexico, given increasing competitive pressures, I mean is this something that is attractive to you? How are you thinking about your own participation, and how soon could that come?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay. I'd say let's take first the Dominican Republic. This is in our forecast in terms of -- so we expect this to come online mid-2016. So this is in our forecast. This is an attractive project. We have a very good portfolio there in the Dominican Republic. I would say that in terms of Mexico, we have a great brand name there. We have a very good brand name because of the turnaround that we did on 2 pet coke plants. They're [indiscernible] and Tiet\u00ea. And our offtakers were Grupo Penoles and CEMEX . And so we have a good brand name. People want us to build more plants there and would like to be our offtaker. We have some potential projects. We have to see if those pan out. But I think that the -- it's an attractive market for us. We've done well there. I think it's a market very correlated, let's say, with U.S. risk, in terms of the economy itself. So we're well positioned. We're looking at the opportunities. And let's see if some of these projects are concrete, and we can announce them.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Turnure.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Could you give us a little bit more color on the drivers of the increase in solar power prices in Brazil? And then give us some color as well on how you're thinking about contracting going forward? We see the slide today that shows where you are now, but has that changed? Have you been more aggressive given the power price increase, et cetera?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","What's interesting in the case of Brazil -- I mean what is driving it? You had medida provis\u00f3ria, MP 579, which let's say, reduced some of the concession life. Some of the company did not renew their concessions on some of the generation assets. And there was somewhat of a slowdown in new construction. Because of that, there's also been a delay on some of the mega hydros on the tributaries of the Amazon. So put that all together, I think that's partly what's driving the higher prices. There's also been the drought in Brazil. But really, when you\u2019re talking '16 onwards, I think it's -- the bigger effect is MP 579. Our strategy was when we had the sort of, cliff falling off in our contract. We actually took a conservative approach and didn't contact everything right away. Had we done so, we would have re-contracted at the then going price of 95 to 100. We thought that it was likely the market would get tighter, of course, based on our conditions. So -- and that has come true. So I think that in terms of our contracting strategy going forward, we're going to continue to take advantage, let's say, of these higher prices and contract more. But it's a little bit sort of a rolling average. So as you go out over time, we're less contracted. It's also you can't get that many long-term contracts in Brazil. It's going to be these sort of 2 to 3-year contracts.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is there any chance that 2 consecutive years of dry hydrology have actually impacted the outer years at all, even though that's, by definition, a short-term phenomenon?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I don't think so. I really don't think so because I think that everybody expects the droughts to reverse and enter more into a normal cycle of El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a-type phenomena.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My second question is on cash flows in the back half of the year. Could you just walk us through how the Eletropaulo kind of true-up works with the regulators there, or with the government subsidy or help plan that they give you? And then kind of how much of a percentage of what you have to make up for in the back half of the year that actually equates to for overall AES?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I'm going to ask Tom to take this question. But basically, the essence is that in both cases, we have higher energy prices that first, we have to pay for the energy and then we bill clients.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, so it's really 2 things. There's tariff adjustments. Both Eletropaulo and Sul have had major tariff adjustments that would capture some of the shorter-term costs, such as purchase power, which is the largest one. And then also there's been a government funding mechanism by the regulator that provides, I think, about $1.2 billion to collectively EP and Sul that allows some direct payment of those higher cost power payments. For us, the big swing factor is Sul. Eletropaulo, we only own 16% of it. It's a more modest amount. But of the $400 million swing that I talked about, of all the utilities, which is down 100 -- or $500 million swing, I'm sorry, down $100 million to plus $400 million from first half to second half, a, about 70% of that is coming out of the U.S. And for us, the lion's share of the Brazilian portion is coming from Sul.","Operator","Our next question is from Kit Konolige.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","So just to get back to DPL, at least, briefly. Obviously, there have been a few questions on the withdrawal of the capacity for sale. Do you -- can you give us any idea of what you're kind of looking for or what kind of timetable you're looking at that might lead to a remarketing of that capacity, or is that really not in the cards at this point?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I would say at this point, it's -- we're not in the cards. I mean we've taken a decision. We expect to improve the performance of those assets. And we think that there are several factors, several different avenues to significant increase in volume in the future of those generation assets. So of course, we don't know exactly how the future, but we think there are several paths where this could have significant upside.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And when you looked at the bids that were coming in and looked at your process for putting those plants up for sale, what's your conclusion, in retrospect, about the difference between your expectations and the bids you got in? I mean what were the buyers seeing there? Was this just too small of a fleet for people to want to buy into? It would have seemed like a pretty good environment with prices having run up some?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, I -- again, I can't get into the minds of the potential buyers. What I would say is that the run-up in forward curves in the better outlook for the RPM capacity also helped us in terms of what we consider our whole value would be.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Kit, it's Tom. I'd just add that obviously, we've done a lot of asset sales around the world, many billions of dollars that have brought $2 billion of cash back to AES. So we've shown an ability to transact. I guess that said, at any -- for all those transactions, when we looked at where the numbers were finally coming down to, we made a judgment ourselves and the board as to whether the assets were worth more to us or more to somebody else. So at least in this case, through a whole lot of factors, it was a tough decision. It was a -- certainly had a lot of discussion. We looked at it hard. We did get real bids from real players, so it certainly was transactable. But it was -- we just thought it worth more to keep than to take the money now.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","And then one other area that I'd like to touch on. You sold your position in some solar assets that you had. And you're investing in other solar assets. Can you give us an idea -- I mean you mentioned for the ones that you're selling that you weren't getting adequate returns. And obviously, for the ones that you're going to invest in, you're expecting to get adequate returns. Can you give us an idea what the difference was? In other words, what was wrong with the solar investment that you made previously? And why is the future one going to be better?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, the big difference is that going forwards, we're really looking at geographic markets. So we're building solar where we have an existing business. So when I mentioned we have 220 megawatts of permitted solar in Chile, we already have a substation there. We already have all of the infrastructure. So it's far less expensive to operate. It's far less expensive to do the development. So that's really the big change in strategy. What we're looking at is the total cost of doing the project and taking advantage of our platforms. So what we did was exit a number of countries. We had relatively small number of megawatts operating them. And what we're doing is we will build solar in the future because we do many types of energy. We will do the energy -- type of energy that is most attractive and makes the most sense for that market, but that also compliments our portfolio. So that's the big difference. We're going to where we have assets, where we can do the development and operations much cheaper than going into markets where we don't have a presence.","Operator","Our next question is from Stephen Byrd.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's actually Rajeev Lalwani on for Stephen's team. 2 questions, the first, just as it relates to Latin America. We've seen some issues in Puerto Rico and Argentina. How concerned are you that, that could spread to other regions? And then likewise, as you look at the Middle East and Russia and places like that, there's been some more headlines. How can that impact your operations? And then a follow-up.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay, talking about -- I think the situation in Argentina is particular to Argentina. I really don't see that spreading. That was a selective default. I'm sure you followed the court cases in New York. And we have 3,000 megawatts of terrific assets in Argentina. They're cash positive and have very little debt on them. They have about $180 million debt for 3,000 megawatts. So [indiscernible], we'll continue to monitor the situation, but we've had really no effect whatsoever to date. If you look at the case of Puerto Rico, it's a case where you do have the commonwealth, as you know, has been downgraded twice. And the reason I mentioned it in my script, we think we have a very strong operation there because we're selling energy at $0.095 per kilowatt hour to PREPA that would cost it $0.20 for itself to self-generate because these are inefficient oil-fired plants. So we have a good contract. It's in our interest. So we're just highlighting that because we wanted to make sure that we covered all of the things that were potential risks. So I don't see those particular situations spreading. Puerto Rico is very unique. Argentina's guys [ph] is very unique. Chile is a very strong economy. Mexico is doing well, Colombia, these are our main other businesses there. Of course, we've already discussed Brazil. So I don't see any contagion. Now moving to Eastern Europe, we talked about Bulgaria. Bulgaria, is somewhat of a unique case, because it actually has a relatively small foreign debt. And so had -- was not that affected by, for example, contamination from Greece. We have been reducing our position in Eastern Europe. We sold Ukraine, you may remember, about 10 months ago. And we're very happy with that decision. How could Bulgaria be affected? Well, Bulgaria does get its gas from Russia, which comes through the Ukraine. So if there were any cut-off of gas from Russia to the Ukraine, it would affect Bulgaria. And that would make our plant even more valuable because it operates on local lignite. And the other thing I would mention about our plant, it's the only EU 16 environmentally compliant thermal plant in the country. So that this is also an important factor to take into account. Now what we've had basically is a transition from the 2 parties and a lack of a firm government. And in that you had a little -- the regulator came out with some rather unexpected statements, which we are trying to manage. So the issue really has been the liquidity situation of the offtaker NEK.","Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then maybe a question for Tom. In terms of additional asset sales, can you talk about maybe regions you're targeting and the process for looking at where you're going to sell?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes. I think consistent with our prior practice, we'd rather not talk about or speculate on things we might do. Keep in mind that some of these businesses are -- obviously have a lot of relationships with people, stake holders, regulators, et cetera, so we'd rather think through something and then announce it rather than creep it out. Andres talked about a $500 million that would be cash back to parent that may be selling entire stakes or selling minority stakes out on the Philippines.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","What I think is important is that -- what I'm saying today is that we had basically met our target for 2014 and 2015 this year. We're saying that we think there could be another additional $500 million. But that would not necessarily be exiting. That could be bringing on partners. Because what we're really focused on now is optimizing our portfolio, optimizing our position in different businesses. So by bringing in partners, this permits us flexibility to try to achieve that optimal portfolio.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Fishman.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Following-up that last question about [indiscernible]. I mean just to make sure I understand. Really, you're dealing with a plant there [indiscernible]. It's a low-cost plant under -- environmentally, it's adequate or even more than adequate. There's, to the best of my knowledge, no talk of nationalization of that plant. So it's really just a receivable from a utility that has a [indiscernible] purchase, that has what appears to be a liquidity issue at the moment. Is that a fair assessment?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I think what you said is fair. One thing I'd say is that our contract in Maritza is not the low cost in the country. Because we had a really state-of-the-art waste disposal facility, which is part of that contract. But you're right in a sense that, really the issue is the liquidity of the offtaker [ph] NEK. NEK sales of energy, it generates us well. Sells energy to the distribution company and also exports energy. Now Bulgaria actually has one of the lowest -- actually has lowest retail tariffs in the EU. So the fact is if the EU rules are enforced, that would retire about 1,000 megawatts in country and make this -- our thermal plant more attractive. And it's also a big employer because again, it uses local lignite. So you're right. I mean the essential problem there really is keeping track of the receivables at NEK and the regulator trying to find various ways to continually to lower retail tariffs. But this has not been [indiscernible] an issue with the government, per se. It's been an issue with the regulator, which is independent of the government.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then second question. [indiscernible], is that a similar technology to Tiet\u00ea?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. But we're thinking about putting in it is -- it's basically our energy storage, which are lithium ion batteries in containers. And what we really have is proprietary algorithms to help with the ancillary services. So we tested it out, we're the world leader in this. And that's exactly right.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","So it's a lot like Tiet\u00ea?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","It's virtually identical. I mean it's the same containers and it would be used in the same fashion.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And then you mentioned the opportunity for energy storage in Asia. Is that technology, or is that [indiscernible] storage or something else?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","It would be exactly the same technology. It works really well in islands where you have sort of isolated grids because you have more instability, especially as you put on more renewables. So we operate on a lot of islands, Hawaii, Northern Ireland, Puerto Rico, and the Philippines, there's a lot of islands. So this is something I spoke to with the President of the Philippines and also his Minister of Energy and Minister of Finance that they're very interested in putting more renewables in, and we could also help that, make it more feasible by putting in the same technology on various of the islands in the Philippines.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And I assume now you're -- I don't know if you're quite a year into Tiet\u00ea, but the performance has been good. And that's given you a showcase to illustrate the technology.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, you're right. The performance has been very good. And it gives us a showcase here in the States. I mean we are also operating larger units in Chile, so those were some of the first units that came out. So I think that the when you have situations like the polar vortex in Ohio, et cetera, it's very good to have a facility like Tiet\u00ea, so I think it's been a great time to showcase its abilities.","Operator","Our final question today is from Paul Patterson.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just to follow-up on Argentina and the -- you guys mentioned that an extreme devaluation might change the outlook or something. Could you just elaborate a little bit more exactly? Sort of what's in guidance, and what your comments -- what that meant?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Ahmed, you want to...","Ahmed Pasha","Paul, I mean we have assumed devaluation when we gave our forecast for 5 years outlook. We assumed roughly 20% on average annual depreciation in Argentine pesos, and it was more front-end loaded. But we did assume devaluation when we gave our outlook. And just to give you, in context, anything beyond that 20%, every 10% is roughly $6 million pretax earnings for us.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Then in terms of the DPL assets, there was some discussion, you did touch on the fact that I think FirstEnergy and AEP are looking to have PPAs, sort of for fuel diversity or stability or what have you. I'm just wondering do you see -- are there any opportunities like that for you guys? Is that any part of what your discussion or decision was in terms of retaining these?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","What we have said is that we look favorably on this because we do think that if you had a replay of the polar vortex post-'16 and you retired as many plants as would be slated for retirement, coal plants, you would have a problem in PGM and in Ohio. So we look favorably on something like that, that would help secure the stability of the network. Because again, that's the last -- how do I say, the worst time possible to be short power. And you don't have adequate transmission capacity. So we look favorably upon it, and certainly, we will be following that very closely. And it could apply to DPL's generation as well.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then just -- not to beat up on the DPL thing. But is there any potential for a partial sale of assets associated with the Duke joint ownership process that they're going under? Since you guys own some of the same plants, could some of those go with them, or how should we think about that? Or it's just too early to say?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I'd say it's too early to say. Let's see what happens with their process. What we're interested in is really optimizing the performance of those plants.","Operator","I'll now turn the call back to the speakers for closing remarks.","Ahmed Pasha","We thank, everybody, for joining us on today's call. As always the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you, and this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"800":["AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) Q4 2016 Earnings Conference Call February 27, 2017  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Ahmed Pasha - VP, Investor Relations","Andr\u00e9s Gluski - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thomas O\u2019Flynn - EVP and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie","Keith Stanley - Wolfe Research","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital","Lasan Johong - Auvila Research Consulting","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2016 Financial Review Conference Call.

Good morning and welcome to AES\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial review call. This morning we will discuss our results and our financial outlook. We will update you on key trends we\u2019re seeing across our markets and the progress we\u2019re making on our construction program and long-term strategy, including our recent announcement that we have agreed to acquire sPower, the largest independent solar developer in the United States.","The key takeaway for today\u2019s call include, we delivered on our 2016 financial guidance; we\u2019re seeing positive developments across our businesses in markets; we are on track to achieve our run rate of $350 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements through 2018; notably, we\u2019re expanding this program by targeting an additional $25 million of annual savings in 2019 ramping up to a $50 million incremental run rate in 2020.","Despite some challenges we are facing on a 3.4 gigawatt construction program, we expect to complete these projects through 2019. We exited non-core assets to bring $500 million in proceeds to AES that we will reinvest to continue to deliver sustainable long-term growth to our shareholders. We signed an agreement to acquire Spower\u2019s renewable portfolio and growth platform.","Spower has an exceptional development team and pipeline, which will contribute high-quality, long-term, and growing U.S. dollar-denominated cash flows. We\u2019re initiating 2017 guidance for adjusted EPS of $1 to $1.10. Finally, we\u2019re introducing our expectation of delivering 8% to 10% average annual growth in free cash flow, adjusted EPS and our dividend through 2020.","I will now discuss some of these themes in more detail. Starting with key trends and developments we are seeing across our markets on Slide 4. In general, we are expecting stronger growth in GDP and electricity demand in most of our markets. In Brazil, demand is expected to grow 1% in 2017 versus a decline of 3% in 2016. In Chile, demand is expected to grow 2% to 3% versus 1% in 2016.","Turning to Chile, where the regulator recently introduced new rules for long-term capacity auction. Under these new rules, winning bidders who do not develop the projects they bid will face significant penalties. We\u2019re encouraged by this development as the penalty should minimize speculative bidding and force market participants to bid with prices that include a fair return on capital.","Moving on to Argentina, where we own and operate 3.5 gigawatts. We are encouraged by positive steps being taken by the new government. This month, the government has raised electricity tariffs and linked generation tariffs to the U.S. dollar. This effectively eliminates our exposure to the Argentine peso. And the result of improved confidence in Argentina, we recently placed a $300 million seven-year bond at 7.75 utilizing a portion of the debt capacity we have in our Argentine businesses. In 2017, we\u2019ve already received $57 million in dividends from Argentina through February following $20 million in 2016.","Now, turning to our construction program beginning on Slide 5. As you know, our construction program is the most significant driver of our cash flow and dividend growth in coming years. In 2016, we commissioned capacity of 3 gigawatts, all of which were completed on time and on budget. We have another 3.4 gigawatts currently under construction, where we\u2019re generally making good progress, although, we are experiencing delays at some of our projects.","Our projects under construction represent total capital expenditures of $6.4 billion. However, AES\u2019s equity commitment is limited to $1.1 billion, of this all, but $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 70% of our investments are in the Americans, mainly in the U.S., Chile, and Panama.","Turning to Slide 6. As you may recall from prior calls, Alto Maipo, an expansion of our existing [indiscernible] power plant in Chile is by far our most complex construction project underway. Since our last call, we have made significant progress on a number of fronts. Specifically, the project is about 49% complete versus 40% at the time of our November call. This progress is in line with our expectations and we remain on track to complete construction in 2019.","Based on further validation over the last three months by independent engineers and our discussion with EPC contractors, we continue to expect cost overruns to be in the 10% to 20% range we discussed on our last call. To fund these overruns and any additional future needs, we have signed the term sheet for additional financing commitments for up to 22% of the project cost.","We also brought in EPC contractor as a minority partner. These overruns would be funded by a combination of project lenders, AES Gener, Minera los Pelambres and EPC Contractor. Although any cost overruns are disappointing these are within the range we discussed on our last call. We continue to see long-term value in the project, as expansion will further diversify AES Gener\u2019s generation mix and offers locational advantages and a long expected life.","Turning to our other projects under construction on Slide 7. As you may remember, we expected three large projects to come on line in 2017. Two of the projects are the closing of the cycle at DPP in the Dominican Republic and the IPL wastewater upgrades with a combined total project cost of $500 million. Both projects are expected to be completed on time and on budget.","The third project, the 671 megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT and IPL is behind schedule. Due to productivity issues on the part of our contractor. We now expect the project to come online in early 2018 versus our original expectation for the first-half of 2017. This delay is obviously disappointing, but manageable, since we do not expect a material impact on our forecasts.","Having said that, our EPC contractor is taking tangible steps to mitigate this delay and finish the project late this year. We have another three projects totaling two gigawatts that are expected to come online in 2018 and 2019. In summary, we remain confident that our 3.4 gigawatts of projects under construction will come online consistent with our revised expectations and continue to be the key driver of our growth through 2020, which Tom will discuss shortly.","Now, turning to our progress on our long-term strategy to deliver attractive free cash flow growth, while at the same time strengthening our credit beginning on Slide 8. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, we are primarily focusing our growth investments on natural gas and renewable projects with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts. We intend to reduce the carbon intensity of our portfolio while ensuring solid growth in cash flow and earnings. These types of projects will improve the quality of our cash flow and help us achieve our credit objectives.","Renewables represent an attractive business opportunity in light of several trends such as the dramatic drop in the cost of renewables that have made their energy production competitive. Today, renewables are the dominant type of new generation build across almost all of our markets. And long-term PPAs are available for renewables, providing predictable stable cash flows. The intermittent nature of renewables does pose challenges for the grid. We believe AES\u2019s ability to leverage renewables by integrating them with conventional energy and energy storage can meet these challenges and give us a strong competitive advantage.","Turning to Slide 9, to that end, late last week we announced that we have agreed to acquire sPower, the largest independent solar developer in the United States. sPower brings 1.3 gigawatts of installed capacity with an average remaining contract life of more than 20 years with very creditworthy off-takers and a first-class management and development team with a pipeline of more than 10 gigawatts.","This acquisition is consistent with our strategy of [indiscernible] our portfolio and increasing the mix of our revenues towards long-term contracted U.S. denominated businesses. This acquisition will provide AES with the scale to secure the best prices when purchasing photovoltaic panels and inverters for our other solar projects around the world. It will also provide us with a proven very successful and disciplined development process that can be used on our renewable projects everywhere.","Our partner on this acquisition is AIMCo, a $95 billion Canadian pension fund with experience in making direct investments in global infrastructure. This strategic partnership will help fund sPower\u2019s attractive growth platform going forward. We intend to fund our $382 million share of the investment largely from excess discretionary cash that we received from the sale of AES Sul in late 2016. We expect high single-digit IRRs from the existing assets, while the development pipeline has the opportunity to earn low double-digit returns that will help drive future growth in cash flow.","The sPower transaction, which is likely to close by the third quarter of 2017, is expected to be accretive to earnings. Although the EPS contribution may be lumpy from year-to-year due to the nature of the tax equity financing that sPower has utilized, we expect on average a high single-digit ROE, which is better than what we could earn if we use the cash to repurchase a mix of debt and equity. The stable cash contributions from this business and its long-term contract model also help make this a credit enhancing transaction.","Now turning to Slide 10, in January Tiet\u00ea in Brazil agreed to acquire 386 megawatts of wind from Renova, which has an average remaining contract life of 18 years. This acquisition is an important strategic milestone for Tiet\u00ea, as this business will not only diversify its generation mix from 100% hydro, but also contribute stable long-term cash flows.","Furthermore, this acquisition which is a 100% levered using Tiet\u00ea\u2019s existing R$1.5 billion debt capacity. This acquisition once again demonstrates our ability to utilize local debt capacity in order to grow our business and improve returns.","Moving onto the Dominican Republic on Slide 11, leveraging our success with ENGIE in Panama, our LNG supplier for our Col\u00f3n project, in December we signed a partnership agreement with ENGIE to market our excess LNG storage and regasification capacity at our Andres terminal in the Dominican Republic.","ENGIE will be able to offer competitive and flexible natural gas products, tailored to meet the needs of downstream customers and dual fuel oil fired generators in the Caribbean. As excess LNG capacity at our terminal gets utilized to meet the needs of these new customers, we will receive enhanced revenue. We see significant potential for this partnership with ENGIE to maximize the value of our existing LNG infrastructure.","Now turning to Slide 12 and our progress on our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative, in 2016 we achieved our incremental $50 million reduction target. We\u2019re on track to reach $350 million in annual savings by 2018. We are now announcing that we\u2019re targeting an additional $25 billion in annual savings in 2019, stepping up to an additional $50 million in 2020 for a total annual run rate of $400 million from our base year of 2011.","Turning to Slide 13. Our asset sales sales program has raised $4 billion in cash to the parent since September 2011. We have exited 11 markets, including the riskiest countries in our portfolio. We will continue to recycle capital and we expect to raise more than $500 million in additional equity proceeds this year. Although we can\u2019t be specific on the businesses that we are targeting for sale, our goal is to continue to optimize our portfolio and improve our risk adjusted return.","Last but not least turning to Slide 14, delevering has been and will continue to be an important part of our strategy. Since 2011, we have reduced our Parent debt by 28% and we expect to achieve investment price statistics by 2020. This will be largely driven by robust growth in our free cash flow and modest debt prepayments.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Thanks, Andr\u00e9s, and good morning. Today, I\u2019ll review our 2016 results and capital allocation. I\u2019ll also provide an update on some key business developments and conclude by addressing our guidance for 2017 and expectations through 2020. Overall, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we finished 2016 at a strong note, meaning, guidance for all metrics and setting a solid foundation for our growth to 2020.","Turning to adjusted EPS on Slide 16, full-year results were $0.98, just below the midpoint of our guidance range. Most of the $0.27 decline from 2015 was anticipated, including the impact of foreign currency devaluation, the expiration of Tiet\u00ea\u2019s PPA, and the absence of some gains that have benefited prior year\u2019s results.","Additionally, our tax rate was lower than normal in part due to restructuring completed in the fourth quarter as expected as well as some other tax items that were not anticipated that went in our favor. This was largely offset by an unanticipated $0.06 one-time reserve taken against certain reimbursements in MCAC in connection with a legal matter.","Now to Slide 17 in our proportional free cash flow and adjusted PTC for the year. We generated $1.4 billion of proportional free cash flow, which was above the top end of our guidance range and represents an increase of $176 million from 2015.","Now results reflect a receipt of overdue receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria, as well as higher collections at our distribution businesses in Brazil. This offset lower margins and a large receipt of overdue receivables in DR in 2015. We also earned $842 million in adjusted PTC during the year, a decrease of $335 million, largely driven by lower margins.","Now, I will cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides beginning on 18. In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins, including the impact of lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers at DPL, which were partially offset by higher contributions at IPL, including the benefits from 2016 rate case and environmental upgrades that came online for year-end.","Higher proportional free cash flow also reflects lower working capital requirements, including lower fuel costs associated with the conversion from coal to gas generation at IPL. At Andes, our results reflect lower margins primarily due to lower spot energy price in Colombia and the devaluation of the Argentine and Colombian pesos.","Adjusted PTC also decreased due to the restructuring of Guacolda in Chile that generated additional equity and earnings in 2015. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections in Argentina and Colombia. I\u2019d also like to note, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, the new tariff in Argentina is linked prices to the U.S. dollar, effectively eliminating our exposure to the Argentine peso.","Our earnings in U.S. dollar equivalent has now increased to 80%, up from 74% since our last call. As you can see on appendix Slide 56, in Brazil, our results reflect lower margins, namely due to the expiration of Tiet\u00ea\u2019s above market PPA at the end of 2015. As part of our rolling hedging strategy we\u2019ve had in place since 2014, Tiet\u00ea is about 80% hedged for the next two years. Proportional free cash flow increased primarily due to the recovery of high purchase power cost from prior droughts at our distribution businesses, Eletropaulo and Sul.","Last year we discussed a strategic shift away from the distribution businesses in Brazil, as evidenced by the sale of Sul. As part of this shift we\u2019re applying to list on the Novo Mercado where only common shares trade. Upon listing, our voting rights, currently above 50%, will become equal to our economic interest of 17% and we would de-consolidate upon losing this controlling interest. For guidance purposes, we\u2019ve assumed de-consolidation for the full year 2007.","In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins primarily due to lower rolling 12 month availability in Mexico and Puerto Rico which was impacted by a fourth quarter outage in 2015. Adjusted PTC also reflects the reserve I mentioned earlier. Proportional free cash flow decreased primarily due to the large settlement of receivables in 2015 in the DR.","In Europe our results reflect lower margins due to the contracted capacity price reduction following the collection of outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria, as well as a 35% devaluation at the Kazakhstan Tenge. Proportional free cash flow benefitted primarily from the collection at Maritza. In the roughly nine months since that settlement payments have been current. Finally in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and lower working capital requirements following commencement of operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in 2015.","Before turning to capital allocation, I want to provide updates on a couple of other developments beginning with our filing at DP&L in Ohio on Slide 24. As you may know, last month we reached a settlement agreement with certain interveners in our ESP case. The agreement includes riders totaling $125 million per year over five years, earmarked for debt reduction in investment in distribution infrastructure. The goal is to achieve sustainable investment grade credit metrics at both DP&L and DPL after the expiration of the ESP.","As part of the agreement we plan to either sell or shut down 2.1 gigawatts of merchant coal fired generation. It\u2019s worth noting that while reaching a settlement is a positive development not all parties have signed on in the agreement, including Commission staff. Hearings are now set for March 8th and we expect to rule into the effect at the beginning in late second quarter or early third quarter that will help reduce leverage and support the progression toward becoming a stable and growing T&D business.","Next on Slide 25, I\u2019d like to briefly discuss our views on potential tax reform. At this time it\u2019s early in the process and unclear which direction final legislation may take. However, I note that under any scenario we do not expect any material cash taxes to be paid for the foreseeable future due to our large NOL position. We would expect to benefit of course from a lower corporate tax rate, as well as from a potential territorial regime that will be supportive of tax efficient repatriation of cash. Certainly the item that could have the most negative impact will be any limitation or elimination of interest deductibility, given the capital-intensive nature of our business and the important role that debt financing plays.","Overall, the impact will be slightly positive under the administration\u2019s plan to slightly negative under scenarios limiting interest deductibility such as the house blueprint. If the reform is enacted, it would likely be a phase in period that allows to mitigate any negative impacts that changes the capital structure and other levers.","Now to Slide 26 and the progress we\u2019re making to improve our credit profile. During 2016 we prepaid $300 million in parent debt and refinanced down the $500 million of floating rate debt with 10-year notes at attractive fixed rates. Since 2011 we have reduced parent debt by $1.8 billion or 28% and reduced interest cost by 125 basis points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you can see on the top of the slide, our nearest maturity at the parent is $240 million in 2019.","Turning to the bottom of the slide, these proactive steps have helped us reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5 times to 5 times debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. We expect our credit to continue to improve, largely driven by a strong growth in parent free cash flow, as well as a modest amount of annual debt reduction. As a result, we expect to attain investment grade credit metrics by 2020. We continue to believe this will not only help to reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation.","Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on Slide 27, which is materially in line with prior disclosures. Sources on the left-hand side reflect $1.2 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $579 million of parent free cash flow, just above the midpoint of our expected range. Sources also include proceeds from asset sales, primarily AES Sul. As expected, this month the parents received $300 million, the remaining proceeds from the sale of Sul after meeting the required notice period for distributions.","Now to uses on the right-hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan, we\u2019ve allocated $400 million for investment in our subsidiaries, a majority of which is for new projects driving our future growth. We prepaid $300 million of our near-term maturities and with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share purchases, we returned about a third of our cash to shareholders last year.","Now to guidance on Slide 28, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we will no longer be giving guidance on proportional free cash flow and instead we\u2019ll report consolidated free cash flow. Our use of proportional free cash flow is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the proportional free cash flow attributable to AES after the impact of non-controlling interests. However, the use of proportional free cash flow is not consistent with the recent SEC guidance in a broader related comment process, so we\u2019ll no longer be disclosing it. Having said that, as a supplemental disclosure in our investor presentations, we provide information about the proportional free cash flow attributable to minority interest.","Today we\u2019re initiating guidance for 2017 and providing expected average annual growth rates through 2020 of 8% to 10% for all key metrics. Key underlying assumptions include FX and commodity forward curves as of year-end 2016; tax rate for 2017 in the range of 31% to 33%, in the low 30s for 2020; at least $500 million in assets sale proceeds in 2017 with $0.03 to $0.04 dilution from the timing lag for the capital that we deployed; the deconsolidation of Eletropaulo in 2017, as I mentioned earlier, and the ease for discretionary cash in line with our capital allocation framework, which I\u2019ll discuss in a moment.","Now to Slide 29, for 2017, our consolidated free cash flow guidance is $1.4 billion to $2 billion, growing at 10% through 2020. We expect free cash flow attributable to non-controlling interests to be 30% to 40% of consolidated free cash flow through 2020.","Parent free cash flow on Slide 30 is expected to be $575 million to $675 million in 2017, a 9% increase over 2016, consistent with our 8% to 10% range.","On Slide 31, our adjusted EPS guidance for 2017 is $1 to $1.10, growing at 8% to 10% from 2016 through 2020. For 2017 this represents 5% growth of the midpoint of our 2016 guidance range. As we said previously, we expected growth to be stronger in 2018 than in 2017. As I mentioned, 2017 includes $0.03 to $0.04 dilution from the asset sales due to the timing lag into proceeds that we deployed. The main drivers of growth for our cost savings plan, improved availability at our plants in MCAC, and contributions from new businesses, including closing the cycle at DPP and the acquisition of sPower.","Our tax rate in 2016 was unusually low and the negative impacted a more normalized rate in 2017, largely offset by some discrete items that benefit us year-over-year. In terms of our long-term growth, we\u2019re expecting 8% to 10% from 2016 to 2020, primary drivers of this growth are contributions from projects under construction coming online through 2019, the benefit from our ongoing cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative and capital allocation including investment in new businesses like sPower.","Regarding the profile of growth over the period, we see stronger growth in 2018 and expect to be at the low-end of our prior range of 12% to 16%. In 2018 we\u2019ll bring online 70% of our current projects under construction. In addition, we expect to benefit by allocating our discretionary cash into both debt reduction at the parent and investment in new growth projects. We also see operating improvement at some of our existing businesses.","Now I\u2019ll discuss our 2017 parent capital allocation on Slide 32. Beginning on the left, sources reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash. Parent free cash flow, the foundation for our dividend growth and value creation is expected to be $575 million to $675 million, up 9%. Sources also reflect asset sales. And as I mentioned, we expect to raise at least $500 million this year in addition to the almost $300 million received in 2017 through Sul.","Now to uses on the right-hand side. Including the dividend increase we announced in December, we\u2019ll be returning almost $320 million to shareholders this year. We expect to pay down at least $200 million to $300 million of debt, a portion of which reflects our continuing efforts to improve our credit profile and achieve investment grade metrics by 2020. The remaining portion will be to maintain credit neutrality associated with planned asset sales.","We\u2019ve allocated $382 million for acquisition of sPower. This represents our share of the $853 million purchase price plus $90 million in acquisition debt funding provided by our partner. We also plan to invest $250 million in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects under construction and in late-stage development. After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt prepayment and our current dividend, we\u2019re left with almost $300 million of discretionary cash.","Before turning back to Andr\u00e9s, I\u2019d like to discuss how we plan to allocate the discretionary cash we\u2019re generating through 2020. On Slide 33, you can see we expect to have $3.7 billion of discretionary cash, primarily from growth in parent free cash flow. After current shareholder dividends, 2017 planned parent debt reduction, as well as the investments in projects under construction and the sPower acquisition, we will have $1.5 billion available for other discretionary uses.","Our guidance assumes targeted 8% to 10% annual dividend growth consistent with parent free cash flow, modest parent de-levering to continue our credit improvement and support our goal of reaching investment grade credit metrics by 2020. And lastly, investments in attractive gas infrastructure projects such as Southland, as well as renewable growth opportunities, including harvesting the sPower growth portfolio, where we own attractive risk-adjusted returns with high quality long-term U.S. dollar- denominated contracts.","With that, I\u2019ll now pass it back to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks Tom. To summarize today\u2019s call, we ended 2016 on a high note by achieving or exceeding our guidance. We made further strides on our strategic goals by making progress on our construction program, which is the biggest driver of our near-term growth, extracting additional cost savings and synergies from our existing platform, rebalancing our business mix by exiting non-core businesses, and redeploying the proceeds in less carbon intensive businesses with long-term U.S. dollar-denominated contracts such as sPower, offering 8% to 10% growth in all key metrics, including free cash flow, earnings and dividends. We\u2019re encouraged by our performance in 2016 and the progress we are making to continue to de-risk the portfolio and deliver compelling returns to our shareholders.","Now, we will be happy to take your questions. Daniel?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you, good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning Ali.","Ali Agha","First question Andr\u00e9s or Tom, just to clarify the dilution that you\u2019re seeing in 2017 in your guidance that $0.03 to $0.04. I\u2019m hearing you right, you are saying that\u2019s a timing issue in terms of when the proceeds are invested, so when \u2013 you do end up investing those proceeds, let\u2019s call it in 2018, is the ultimate impact neutral, accretive or still dilutive, how should we think about this?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","You\u2019re right, it\u2019s $0.03 to $0.04 and it\u2019s really a timing impact. We think that the effect should be probably about neutral, be very minimal. Of course it will ultimately depend exactly on the transaction that we invest, but you know I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be strongly you know certainly dilutive.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then also clarifying, Tom, the profile that you were laying out to us, as you mentioned at the mid-point of your 2017 guidance, you are up 5%. If I\u2019m hearing you right, in 2018 you should be up like 12% over 2017, if I heard that right? And then should we assume fairly even growth in 2019, 2020 as part of your profile?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, that\u2019s fair.","Ali Agha","Okay, so those two years have mapped them out consistent?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes and actually the 12%, Ali, was off of midpoint of 2016.","Ali Agha","Is that a CAGR or is that a \u2013 I\u2019m little confused?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","We had previously said that we thought growth in 2016 to 2018 would be 12% to 18 \u2013 12% to 15% EPS, so we still think that 2018 will be at the low-end of that 12 and 12 range. We obviously want to go our path then to give investors a longer profile.","Ali Agha","Right, but that\u2019s a CAGR we are talking, 2016 through 2018 12% CAGR.","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes.","Ali Agha","Okay, and then third question, just to understand some of the assumptions that you mapped into this longer term outlook. So I\u2019m assuming, do we assume in there that the Ohio settlement is approved as such and kicks in with that $125 million number, is that assumed in there? And what FX moves have you assumed? Is it just looking at the forward curve in the outer years as well or some assumed dilution, what have you assumed there?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, we assume forward curves as always. And in terms of DPL, it\u2019s in the range \u2013 we\u2019re in discussions, so I\u2019d rather not be too specific, but it\u2019s in the ballpark of what we\u2019ve been discussing.","Ali Agha","Okay. And then lastly, the points you made about the free cash flow usage of roughly the $1.5 billion that you\u2019re left with. When you assume some investment in there, are you assuming the average ROE of 14% or what kind of return are you assuming on that excess cash?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Well, some of it\u2019s for defined projects like [indiscernible] so we got a pretty good visibility on that, but we\u2019re really looking across our portfolio based on \u2013 as we look at our portfolio, we look at risk and returns consistent with the country, the project etcetera. So it\u2019ll be a range of things from 14%, down to things in the low double-digit consistent with Andr\u00e9s\u2019s comment on the sPower sales pipeline.","Ali Agha","I see, okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good morning. Lots of things to talk about.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That\u2019s right. Good morning, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Perhaps first just a real quick question, a couple easy ones. sPower, what kind of EPS should be assuming once that closes on annualized basis. Is it simply taking a high single digit ROE from the equity invested or because of the ITC [indiscernible] something lower than that in terms of the ongoing ROE?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Hey Julien, it\u2019s Tom. It\u2019s only a few cents a year, as Andr\u00e9s said, it\u2019s lumpy, so \u2013 but generally it\u2019s a few cents a year. If you look at over longer period, the ROEs would line up with the IRRs. The ROEs in the early years are little better, because the nature of the accounting comes with the tax equity investments, obviously it\u2019s bigger if we \u2013 if it\u2019s more size \u2013 size of\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it, so it\u2019s shooting above that level in the earlier, so is there kind of a \u2013 what\u2019s embedded in 2017 guidance for instance, or as you think about 2018 with the sPower deal\u2026","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","I think...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","\u2026[indiscernible] and also the trajectory thereafter?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, few cents a year.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, just a couple cents give or take.","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yeah.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay got it. And then moving \u2013 what\u2019s the impact of deconsolidating Eletropaulo in EPS, just \u2013 I just want to make sure.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","None. Just on that\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, great.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","\u2026just on the consolidated free cash flow.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right, and also what\u2019s reflected in terms of DPL in your 2017 guide and onwards?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think Tom answered that in terms of \u2013 you know basically we are not going to discuss it, but it\u2019s within the range that\u2019s public.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. All right, fair enough. And then following on Ali\u2019s last one, the 12% to 16% well in, so that would be roughly above 24, 12% compounded, two years off of 2016\u2019s dollar?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, that\u2019s right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And then what do you think about a normalization of the effective tax rate, 31% to 33%, how do you think about that in 2018 and onwards, just as you \u2013 more structurally.","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Well, that\u2019s the rates we\u2019ve always talked about, it\u2019s sort of in the low 30s. Obviously there is talk about tax reform in the U.S. and we\u2019ll of course incorporate any changes there. I mean it\u2019s a very positive thing such as territorial tax, lower rates. On the other hand there is talk about limiting interest deductibility, and so we\u2019ll see how that washes out. So I mean basically we\u2019re looking at \u2013 we do not believe most of the proposals in the reasonable range will have a material impact on us.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And lastly, if you can elaborate just quickly, timing on OPGC 2, just on shifts, what\u2019s the latest status if I can?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I mean we are making very good progress on OPGC 2. We had talked about that versus the original expectations, we\u2019re about six months behind, we haven\u2019t lost any more time and basically the project is up and running and we\u2019ve done the related infrastructure projects, whether it be the rail or the new housing. So that project is coming along very nicely.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. All right, I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Julien.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning Steve.","Stephen Byrd","Thanks for the comprehensive guidance you\u2019re looking out. I wanted to go to your Slide 33 and think about the discretionary cash bid. When you think about the targeted credit metrics that you\u2019re looking to achieve later in the decade, can you give us a bit of color on how we should be thinking about those metrics?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Hey Stephen, so our ratio is now five, we think we need to get down the four range, obviously it\u2019s dependent upon business mix, but we\u2019ve gone from 6.5 to five and we think something in the four range would be would represent investment grade metrics. So, that will come with some parent debt reduction and also continuing growth in our parent free cash flow.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","One thing I\u2019d like to add about that also is the qualitative aspect. As we have more dollar-denominated long contracted cash flows, that is qualitative aspect, I think it\u2019s very important. So that\u2019s part of that evolution as well.","Stephen Byrd","All fair points and it looks like you\u2019ll have a fair amount of true discretionary cash even achieving those leverage metrics, so that\u2019s great. And just shifting over to sPower, when we think about how you\u2019re going to finance the growth and those returns, I assume that you laid out are levered returns. Should we be assuming that you\u2019ll avail yourself with a typical project financed debt leverage levels which you can get? And then for the equity check, will it likely be 50-50 with your partners or should we be thinking about that differently?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, you\u2019re right. I mean, we\u2019re thinking of 50-50 with our partner with AIMCo. I would say that in terms of you know how to finance them is a continuation of the mixes which you have now and obviously you\u2019ll have some phasing down of the ITC, we still see that there will be appetite from financials for tax equity into these protects.","One thing I\u2019d like to stress about the acquisition of sPower is really the effect it will have on our whole portfolio and obviously we can do solar project all over our platform and we have some very attractive opportunity, especially where we can integrate them with our existing conventional plans. We think that is a very interesting product offering that sort of load following energy that can be supplied and taking into account the sort of intermittency of renewables we can offer a better product.","So really with the pipeline that should be delivering between 500 and 1 gigawatt of new projects per year, this really is a \u2013 we\u2019ll be bale to leverage this across our portfolio whether it be purchasing. And also we think that this team has been extremely successful with a very disciplined development projects, it really has a proven track record.","So when we think about sPower, we think about the JV with AIMCo, which will continue to grow on a 50-50 basis. But in addition, there will be synergies, which will be beneficial to other AES projects, but also to the JV, because the more we buy and the \u2013 had those economies of scale, the JV will benefit from this as well.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s a great color, Andr\u00e9s. And just on the pipeline what we\u2019re talking about that it\u2019s a huge number in terms of the potential size. Is there anyway for us to get a better sense for the degree of risk or flipped around the degree of certainty that you might have in terms of pursuing this pipeline, is it some very early stage or some quite advanced and you feel quite good about your prospects, how should we think about that, just given how big it is?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well there is over 200 megawatts which already has PPI contracts. There is another over 200 which has, are under PPI negotiations. There are about 2 gigawatts which are platform expansions and those again have lower risk because you already have operating assets in those areas. And then the rest are various degrees of development. I would say that a lot of this rest upon sPower\u2019s reputation and with clients which range not only from utilities, but corporate as well.","So we see this is a very robust pipeline in general, and we will see how this develops over the following years, but it is more or less sort of commissioning 500 megawatts at first and it should ramp up to 1 gigawatt. Now I would say also that this is not, this is something we tried, when we acquired main stream power, which is more distributed energy smaller, but it is interesting. The main stream has done about \u2013 I believe a little bit less than 60, 70 megawatts in its entire history.","Last year under AES, they did 88 megawatts, and this year it could be as high as 200 megawatts. So I think this shows how bringing in sort of AES\u2019 financial capabilities, also our market knowledge can empower this. So, we see this as you know we tried on a much smaller scale and now we are going to a large scale.","Stephen Byrd","Super, helpful. Thank you very much. That\u2019s all I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So wanted to talk about the guidance for free cash flow growth. I understand the dilution on the earnings impact, the diversities and their impact on the EPS CAGR, but about the cash flow CAGR, I mean that has come down a little bit, right? You had expected a 10% CAGR in proportional free cash flow, I don\u2019t think that the controlling interest has had any impact here. Why the reduction here in growth expectations?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Angie, remember the 10% was through 2018. So we are doubling the period, going to 2020 and saying 8% to 10%, so it \u2013 I think it is still consistent with our general trajectory. We did use the base line as a mid-point of 2016 guidance. Remember that we got about 300 million from interest, so, in 2016 so you are not going to yet normalize for that.","Angie Storozynski","Okay.","Ahmed Pasha","And this is Ahmed. I think the shape will be more front end loaded because we have about $1 billion of equity in our construction projects. So those projects are coming on line in the 2018, so we will see more contribution front end loaded from those investments.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Secondly on Alto Maipo, so basically you have about 300 million in cost overruns and do you agreed on financing only 22% of it, is that correct?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Put it this way. We have the cost overruns are expected to be in the range of 10% to 20%. We have financing that we are closing on for up to 22%. So, we would cover even the sort of worst estimate in terms of cost overruns.","Angie Storozynski","Also that 22% is not of the cost overrun, it is of the entire project?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","That\u2019s correct. The 110% of the worst case of the cost overruns, it would be like 220% of the expected case.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, fantastic. And then lastly on your EPS guidance, I mean just looking at how your CAGR \u2013 I mean that would imply about $1.40 to $143 in EPS by 2020, which is probably ahead of your prior expectation for 2020 earnings. I know that you were not giving explicit guidance, but it almost seems like there is a slower earnings growth initially and then it accelerates by \u2013 and basically exceeds expectations of prior earnings growth by 2020? That\u2019s your assessment?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That\u2019s correct. Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Angie Storozynski","Okay, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Keith Stanley from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Keith Stanley","Hi, good morning. Do you think it\u2019s possible that DPL to still get PUCO Staff on board to a deal here? Do you expect the case to be fully litigated at this point?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We think it\u2019s possible to get PUCO Staff onboard, very much so.","Keith Stanley","Okay. And that would be before the March date [ph]?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah, I mean, obviously, Keith, time is running out, but we continue to have an open dialogue and open door and expect something will be figured out, sir, that\u2019s \u2013 we are certainly open to that.","Keith Stanley","Okay, great. And then at Eletropaulo \u2013 well, on the asset sales, besides Eletropaulo, I mean, do you get the $500 million, it sounds like there is some other material sales you are planning or several assets being marketed right now or at a high level how can we think about what you might be looking to sell?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, again, you know, these are ongoing businesses; we never talk about them before its close. But what I would say is that look at what we\u2019ve said as our strategy, in terms of de-risking the portfolio of reducing our carbon intensity. Those are the types of assets we have sold and we will continue to sell. Obviously, with the number of $500 million, we have something specific in mind, which is advanced for us to feel confident in terms of getting this guidance, so that\u2019s as far as I can go, but I would say that \u2013 as we\u2019ve always said, we will continue to sort of churn our assets and invest them in better -adjusted returns.","Keith Stanley","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Gregg.","Gregg Orrill","Good morning. Can you provide a little more detail or perspective around the $0.06 reserve from the fourth quarter and then thoughts on returns around your investment in wind in Brazil?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay. Taking the first one, I mean, that was basically we had a legal case, which we had \u2013 let\u2019s say the possibility of getting it funded and we did took a reserve against that, we don\u2019t want to get into more detail about that. Certainly, a close case, there shouldn\u2019t be anything more going forward.","Gregg Orrill","Okay.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Regarding the wind in Brazil, this is Renova\u2019s asset, these are contract \u2013 18-year contract in reals indexed to CPI. I think we are buying them at a very attractive price. We will remain the people that in the past when Brazil was really booming, we never bought anything that \u2013 at those prices we didn\u2019t think it was attractive, now we see this is being at attractive prices. I also think that it\u2019s very important to get Tiet\u00ea to be growing again and we are utilizing 100% of local financing for this project. So it\u2019s an attractive acquisition and it really is a milestone for Tiet\u00ea.","Gregg Orrill","Okay. So around the reserve, I think you said this, it\u2019s not an impact for ongoing earnings or how are you getting paid, I mean, it still be the case?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Absolutely not. It\u2019s a short case.","Gregg Orrill","Okay, good enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research Consulting. Please go ahead.","Lasan Johong","Andr\u00e9s, the 8% to 10% compound annual growth rate guidance, I assume has some 80% level of your vast development projects in it, can you kind of give me some color how much of your development projects outside of your vast development projects are embedded in that 8% to 10% growth rate.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think this is really anchored in the projects that we know. Southland is in these projects. The energy storage of Southland is there as well. We have the completion of OPGC 2 and the completion of Alto Maipo in 2019. Now besides that we do have some modest \u2013 we have the growth of sPower, that I\u2019ve talked about 500 megawatts ramping up to 1 gigawatt towards the end of that period. We also have some growth in terms of distributed energy as well around 200 megawatts a year. Other than that it\u2019s basically redeploying that cash, there will be other acquisitions that could be smaller ones add-ons, and there could be some additional energy storage project, again, modest energy storage project and \u2013 besides that growth. So, that\u2019s what embedded in those numbers.","Lasan Johong","So, if I may, what you are telling me is that, this is about as conservative as you are going to get in terms of your guidance going forward?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think it\u2019s reasonably conservative. I do think if some markets really pop like energy storage and third party sales or something it could be superior to that. We have other things that we are looking at from diesel to other applications, but I think it\u2019s reasonably conservative is the right approach to it. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a most conservative case.","Lasan Johong","Yes, you\u2019ve been going through a lot of restructuring, selling, buying assets, where \u2013 can you tell me where you see AES\u2019 mix of businesses, is that \u2013 what are you trying to drive towards? I mean it\u2019s pretty clear in the U.S. you want to get clean, okay, so we understand that. The rest of world, what are your objectives in terms of how you want to poster AES going forward?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That\u2019s a great question. What we see is we will continue our strategy, simplifying the portfolio. And I always said that we don\u2019t need to be in 20 countries to really have the advantages of diversification. We do see having a strong footprint in the U.S. because it gives us stable cash flows, it\u2019s also the most technologically advanced market in all regards, whether it would be energy storage, whether it would be \u2013 on the commercial sense and then we really see ourself being the bridge from that to faster growing markets. And with the big emphasis in Latin America and a big emphasis to the extent we can get dollar-denominated contracts. So that\u2019s where we see AES of the future.","Now we do see conventional energy as being an important part of this. We really see that as a great advantage to the extent you can integrate renewables into your product and service offerings to final clients. So there is a greening of the portfolio in large part because we are just seeing energy prices from renewables come down so much, also it\u2019s because you can get long-term contracts for renewables.","And finally because that\u2019s a part of the market that\u2019s growing, I mean almost 60% of new adds in the worlds are renewables. So in virtually all of our markets that\u2019s a segment, that\u2019s why we want to be there. On the other hand we see the advantages of AES as being able to integrate that into existing platforms. So platform expansions continues to be an important part of our strategy and it\u2019s one of things we like very much about sPower, they have a platform expansion strategy.","Lasan Johong","Is it safe to assume that Brazil is going to get absorbed into MCAC at some point, once you deconsolidate Eletropaulo and it becomes a really small part of your business?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, and I would say the following reason, I mean, Brazil has its own market, it has its own relations, it has its own regulatory structure, so we think they will have to continued to be managed in that way. Tiet\u00ea is also a publicly listed company. Now we are very happy to start Tiet\u00ea growing again, because I think that will have a good impact on local investors and the multiple we get for Tiet\u00ea. Remember, our SBUs are basically organized around markets, so what we would like is that the teams there face similar clients, similar regulators, similar financial institutions.","Lasan Johong","Last question, Argentina, it sounds like AES is starting to think about keeping that business unit, is that something I\u2019m imagining or is this something new that\u2019s developing?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, we\u2019ve always said that Argentina had significant upside potential and we are seeing that this year or actually started seeing it last year. I mean, Argentina, we sold it out of the distribution businesses, which were, I would say, difficult.","Lasan Johong","Yeah.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","But we are left with a very solid, excellent technically generation business, which has made money pretty much every year. We had three years where weren\u2019t able to pay dollar dividends, but Argentina is part of Andes SBUs, this is \u2013 synergies and some interconnections with the Chilean market.","Lasan Johong","Yes.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","But we are seeing a tremendous progress in Argentina, tremendous progress in our business and I think it\u2019s very much in line with what we were telling everyone before is that Argentina had significant upside potential and some of that upside potential is being realized. I think there is even more potential going forward.","Lasan Johong","Opportunities for more investments in Argentina possible?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think, if we did anything in Argentina, I would be using local leverage capacity, like we are doing in Brazil, like we are doing in the Dominican Republic.","Lasan Johong","I understand.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","And in the past when we talked about proportional free cash flow and how we were paying down sub-debt and creating opportunities, I think, between DPP and Tiet\u00ea are two excellent examples of how we can lever the local business, 100% levered and come up with attractive, in both cases very carbon friendly projects with long-term contracts.","Lasan Johong","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","Good morning. Andr\u00e9s, can you give \u2013 are you able to give anymore color on what the staffs objection was \u2013 Ohio staffs objection was to the settlement agreement?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, we really aren\u2019t. We are in negotiations now and we think we will reach the settlement, but we can\u2019t give any more color. Sorry.","Charles Fishman","Okay. I thought that would be your answer. And then the second question was just to make sure I understand this, on the way you are reporting now, if I look at Slide 29, the consolidated free cash flow growth and if I deduct my estimate, okay, between 30% and 40% for the non-controlling interest, that would be equivalent to the way you used to report proportional free cash at the consolidated level, correct?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That\u2019s right, yes.","Charles Fishman","Am I?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, you are right.","Charles Fishman","Okay, thank you. Got it. I just want to make sure I have it right. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","All right. Thank you, Charles.","Ahmed Pasha","Okay. So I think with this we conclude today\u2019s call and we thank everybody for joining us on this call. As always IR team will be happy in answering your questions.

Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thanks, Nicole. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2016 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our Web site at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There're many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2016 financial review call. Today, I will provide an update on our year-to-date performance, key market trends and our long-term strategy in the context of those trends. Tom, will then review positive regulatory developments at DPL and Ohio, and our financial results, as well as provide color on our curtain guidance.","Year-to-date we generated proportional free cash flow of $1.1 billion, representing 91% of the mid-point of our full-year guidance, and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.64, representing 64% of our full-year guidance, consistent with expectations that we communicated to you previously. These results keep us on track to achieve our full-year guidance, which Tom will address in detail.","Now turning to key market trends on slide five. At a high level, we're seeing changes in some of our markets due to the entry of natural gas and low cost renewables. However, we're generally well positioned to take advantages of these changes, because we have already begun to invest in these technologies, and because most of our largely contracted portfolio has locational and cost advantages. Accordingly, despite what we have recently seen in some markets, like Chile, we remain confident in the long-term strength of our portfolio.","We see a future with the operator who has an efficient thermal and hydro fleet, and can integrate them with the new technologies will be the winner. We're also on track to meet our expectations through 2018, which are driven by our construction and cost reduction programs. Most of our construction programs are going well with the exception of Alto Maipo, which represents 15% of the total megawatts under construction.","There's no question that the future growth across our markets will be heavily weighted towards less carbon intensive gas, wind, and solar generation. Accordingly, we've been taking actions in this regard for some time now.","For example, as we've discussed on previous calls, we have been expanding our LNG infrastructure into Central America as shown on slide six. Our $1 billion Colon project in Panama will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes a 380 megawatt combined cycle gas plant, and 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a 10 year U.S. dollar denominated power purchase agreement. This project will diversify Panama's reliance on hydro based generation, while also meeting a growing need for natural gas across Central America.","By introducing natural gas to the region, we're displacing oil fired generation in favor of a cheaper and cleaner alternative, and also serving the needs of many potential downstream customers, including commercial and industrial users and the transportation industry.","On slide seven, we see another example of how we're responding to environmental concerns about coal fired generation. In Indiana, we just completed a multi-year $550 million rate based investment in environmental upgrades through our coal plants and the repowering of several units from coal to gas. We will further shift ideal fuel mix away from coal when we complete the 671 megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana in the first-half of 2017. The combined impact of these investments will be to reduce the gigawatt hours IPL producers from coal by about 40%.","Turning to slide eight, the growth in renewables, not only provides an opportunity for direct investments in wind and solar generations but creates a market for energy storage. We plan to invest in wind and solar generation in our markets with our primary focus on U.S. dollar denominated long-term contracts. In fact, since last year, we have added more than 150 megawatts of solar with long-term contracts in the U.S., about half of which is operating and the rest will come online in 2017.","Regarding energy storage, we believe this technology will play a critical role in an increasingly renewables based generation mix. AES has been designing, deploying and operating battery based energy storage systems for almost a decade. Today, with our proprietary Advancion platform, is the world leader, with more than 400 megawatts in operation under construction on an advanced stage development across seven countries. In 2016, we have already closed Advancion\u2019s sales to third-parties, totaling more than $70 million in gross revenue. With our proven storage platform, unequaled experience, and global reach through AES and our sales channel partnerships, we\u2019re ideally positioned to capitalize on this rapidly growing market.","Turning now to slide nine, I\u2019d like to discuss what we consider to be key underlying strength of our businesses, a highly contracted portfolio and the competitive nature of our assts, even in those markets where LNG based and renewable generation are making inroads. As you can see on this slide, as a result of our proactive contracting and portfolio rebalancing initiatives, today, about 75% of our business is U.S. dollar based. About 85% of our business is either contracted generation or regulated utilities. The average remaining life on our PPAs at our contracted businesses is seven years, and when we complete our current construction program in 2020, it will be extended to 10 years.","Turning to slide 10, although that\u2019s a long average remaining contract life, there are few markets where our markets will roll-off sooner. Nonetheless, we believe that our position in those particular markets will allow us to continue to earn attractive returns after the current contracts expire. The majority of our businesses are low cost, flexible and reliable energy providers with strong locational advantages. Our knowledge of these markets and critical mass also puts us in a position to take advantage of growth opportunities, or quickly respond to changing conditions.","Let me talk about a few of these markets in more detail. In the Dominican Republic, a portion of our contracts are rolling off in the next three years. However, our plans are mostly gas-fired and we offer the lowest cost source of generation in the system, which is 54% oil-based. Based on today\u2019s relative fuel prices, our variable cost is half of that of oil fired generation, which puts us in a good position to re-contract our plans on favorable terms.","In 2017, we will complete the closing of the cycle at our DBP gas plant, which will add 122 megawatts without increasing our carbon footprint. In the Philippines, we operated 630 megawatt coal fired plant, and are building a 335 megawatt expansion. The existing Masinloc plant is more than 90% contracted until 2019, and we have already reached an agreement pending regulatory approval with the plant off-taker for an extension to 2022. In terms of the 335 megawatt expansion project, which will come online in 2019, we have already signed 10 to 20 year contracts covering 50% of the capacity.","Our plants in the Philippines will be even more competitive once the country\u2019s gas plants, which account for 25% of the system supply, move from base load to mid merit when their current take or pay gas contracts roll-off from 2019 to 2023. In California, our Southland contracts are expiring in December of 2019 and 2020, but we have already re-contracted these facilities under a 20 year PPA that will require the repowering of its assets. With the new contract, we expect to see growth in earnings and the cash flows from this business.","Now moving to Chile, on slide 11, where we are largely contracted. Although there has been a slow-down and economic growth, mainly due to the impact of the falling mineral prices on the Chilean economy, we remain optimistic about the future prospect of the country. As you may know, the recent auctions for contracts beginning in 2021 and 2022 cleared significantly below market expectations. We believe these prices reflect aggressive bidding by both new market participants and existing hydro owners.","Nonetheless, we do not believe that this will have a meaningful impact on our business in Chile in the near to medium term because AES Gener is largely hedged with an average remaining PPA life of 11 years.","So, our exposure for the next five years is quite limited with only 8% of our contracts rolling off in '21 and '22. Although, over the long-term, we do forecast some softening in prices, we do not believe this auction result is necessarily indicative of the long-term price load. While Chile does have excellent solar and good wind resources, some of the assumptions underlying the recent auction outcome may have been aggressive on capital cost declines, load factors, and all-in costs to support renewable assets with a 24\/7 load following obligation.","We see renewables, energy storage, and thermal resources as complementary in the future Chilean grid. In fact, we believe our existing portfolio will be even more important in the long-term as we see higher demand growth driven by an eventual acceleration and economic growth. Accordingly, our existing assets are well positioned to provide reliable and competitive energy to the Chilean grid.","Now turning to slide 12 to our construction program, which is the most significant driver of cash flow and dividend growth in the coming years. Since our last call, we've completed construction of our 532 megawatt Cochrane power plant in Chile, which is 100% contracted for 18 years. This brings our year-to-date commission capacity to 3 gigawatts, all of which were completed on-time and on-budget. We have another 3.4 gigawatts remaining under construction where we are generally making good progress.","The main exception to our strong performance on construction is Alto Maipo, a 531 megawatt one of the river hydro plant in Chile, which is by far our most complex construction project underway. Today, the overall project is about 40% completed. As we discussed on our last call, we've encountered geological issues while excavating some underground tunnels. After consultation with the contractor and independent consultant, our expectation is still for Alto Maipo to be completed in 2019, at a cost that is about 10% to 20% over the original budget.","We expect the additional capital cost of roughly $200 million to $400 million will be funded by a combination of lenders and project sponsors. Discussions with lenders are underway. I'd note that notwithstanding the challenges we have encountered at Alto Maipo, we have a strong track record of completing projects on-time and on-budget. In the last five years, AES has delivered more than 5 gigawatts of projects, which were completed on-time and on-budget. Accordingly, we are confident that our construction program will continue to drive attractive growth in our free cash flow and earnings.","Turning to slide 13, excluding the cost overrun at Alto Maipo, which I mentioned earlier, our 3.4 gigawatts currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $6.4 billion. However, AES's equity commitment is limited to $1.1 billion. Of this, over $250 million has already been funded. Roughly 70% of our investments are in the Americas, mainly Chile, Panama and the U.S.","Before I turn the call over to Tom, I would like to emphasize our de-risking of our Company over the last five years on slide 14. Today, we're in a strong position to execute on the strategic growth opportunities I just discussed in large part because the actions we have taken. We've exited 11 markets, including the riskiest countries in our portfolio. This week we also closed the sales of AES Sul, a utility in Brazil, which decreases our exposure to Brazilian regulatory and hydrology risk to more appropriate levels.","In total, our asset sales programs through since September of 2011 has raised $4 billion in cash to the parent. We are investing our discretionary cash towards projects that are better aligned with our strategy like LNG in Central America and renewables in the US. In Panama, our hydro assets will be more valuable by 2019 when we begin the operating the Nation\u2019s first gas fired plant and LNG facility, which will cap energy prices in times of drought. These investments not only drive solid growth in cash flow and earnings but also offer our investors a more robust and optimal portfolio.","Last but not least, de-leveraging has been and will continue to be an important part of the strategy. Over the past five years, we have reduced our parent debt by 28%. And based on the growth of our cash flow, we expect to achieve investment grades stats by 2020. We believe that in conjunction all of these actions will deliver attractive risk adjusted returns to our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas O'Flynn","Thanks Andr\u00e9s, and good morning. Today, I will review our results, including adjusted EPS proportional free cash flow and adjusted pre-tax contribution, or PTC, by Strategic Business Unit or SBU. Then I\u2019ll cover our 2016 capital allocation, as well as our guidance and expectations. Before I get started, I\u2019ll remind you of a couple of items that helped our results in the third quarter of last year, one was the restructuring of Guacolda in Chile that generated $0.06 in equity and earnings. And the other was a large receivables collection in the Dominican Republic, which led to higher than normal proportional free cash flow.","Now turning to slide 16, third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.32 was $0.06 lower than 2015. This decline is in line with our expectations that we communicated in our last call. Specifically, our third quarter results reflect positive contribution from our businesses, particularly in the U.S. where we benefited from rate based growth at our utility IPL in Indiana, and improved availability at DPL in Ohio. The impact of the Guacolda restructuring in 2015 and also the $0.02 impact from the devaluation of foreign currencies as expected particularly in Andes and Europe.","Now to slide 17, proportional free cash flow and adjusted PTC for the quarter. We generated $400 million of proportional free cash flow, a decrease of $221 million from last year. This reflects slightly lower margins and the impact of working capital in the MCAC SBU specifically to DR, where although collections remained strong, we have the large receivable settlement last year. We also earned $272 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $43 million largely driven by the Guacolda restructuring.","Next I\u2019ll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 18. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively higher margins, including the benefit from the environmental upgrades on 1,700 megawatts of capacity that came online through this quarter and from this year\u2019s rate case at the IPL, as well as higher contributions in DPL, reflecting our continuing actions to improve the availability of our generation fleet. At Andes our results reflect higher margins, primarily due to lower spot fuel and energy purchases, as well as the start of commercial operations at Cochrane Unit 1 in Chile. This was partially offset by lower spot prices and generation at Chivor in Columbia, where we replenished reservoir levels after increasing production when energy prices were at record high in December of last year.","Margins also reflect a 38% devaluation of the Argentine peso. Adjusted PTC decreased due to Guacolda restructuring, and proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of lower VAT collections in Chile after Cochran came online.","In Brazil, our results were largely driven by lower margins, mainly due to exploration Tiet\u00ea\u2019s PPA at the end of 2015. As part of our rolling hedging strategy that we had in place since 2014, Tiet\u00ea is about 80% hedged over the next two years. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins, primarily due to lower rolling 12 month availability in Puerto Rico, which was impacted by fourth quarter outage in 2015. Adjusted PTC was further impacted by lower interest income on overdue receivables in the Dominican Republic where collections have improved. Proportional free cash flow decreased, primarily due to large settlement of receivables in the DR.","In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the contracting capacity price reduction following the successful settlement of outstanding receivables at Maritza in Bulgaria, as well as the 36% devaluation of the Kazakhstan Tenge. Proportional free cash flow benefitted from higher collections at Maritza. It's worth mentioning that we continue to see improved collections in the roughly six months since that settlement and payments are current. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and working capital requirements year-over-year.","Now to slide 24, I'll provide an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio where we've seen some positive momentum on the regulatory front. We remain in active discussions with the commission staff and interveners. As you may know, last month we amended our ESP filing to propose a distribution modernization rider of $145 million per year over seven years with the aim of achieving and maintaining investment grade rating at DP&L. Hearings are now set for early December, and we expect the ruling to be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2017 that'll support the financial viability and credit profile of the business.","Now to slide 25 and the progress we're making to improve our credit profile. In the third quarter, we prepaid $180 million of parent debt, bringing our total debt pay-down year-to-date to $300 million. Since 2011, we\u2019ve reduced parent debt by $1.8 billion or 28% and reduced interest by 125 basis-points, resulting in an annualized interest savings of $180 million. As you'll see on the top of the side, we have no debt maturing at the parent until 2019, and only $240 million is due.","Turning to bottom of the slide, these proactive steps have helped us reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5 times to slightly over 5 times debt to parent free cash flow plus interest. These actions reflect our strategy to de-risk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We expect our credits to continue to improve, largely driven by a strong growth in parent free cash flow, as well as the modest amount annual debt reduction. As a result, we expect to attain investment grade credit metrics by 2020. We believe this will help us reduce our cost to debt, improve financial flexibility, and also, importantly, enhance our equity valuation.","Turning now to our 2016 parent capital allocation on slide 26, which is materially in line with our prior discussions. Charts on the left hand side reflect $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is a foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation.","Sources also include proceeds from assets sales, primarily for AES Sul, where we\u2019re estimating net proceeds of $440 million, including a sub-dividend at around $25 million, after accounting for working capital adjustments and transaction costs. Although, we\u2019ve successfully closed the sale in October, we anticipate receiving the majority of the proceeds at the parent in the first quarter of 2017 after meeting the required notice period for distributions.","Now the uses on the right hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan with 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases, we are returning about a third of our allocated cash to our shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As I just mentioned, we have already prepaid $300 million of our near-term maturities. We\u2019ve also allocated $360 million for investments in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is from new projects driving our growth through 2018 and beyond.","After considering these investments in our subsidiaries, debt repayment and our current dividend we\u2019re left with roughly $400 million of discretionary cash. This, together with our 2017 free cash flow, will provide a strong foundation to grow our dividend, continue to de-lever and earn attractive risk adjusted returns by investing in our development pipeline focused on gas and low cost renewables.","Now turning to slide 27. As reflected in our third quarter and year-to-date, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow. And our third quarter adjusted EPS was also in line with our expectations. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2016 guidance for all metrics. Since earlier this year, we\u2019ve also experienced some headwinds, including outages at two of our businesses in MCAC, as well as a slightly negative impact from reverting back to ESP-1 rates and also some dark spread compression at DPL in Ohio. However, we\u2019re expecting to offset these impacts with a couple of items, one of which would lead to a lower full year effective tax rate.","Finally, before I hand it back to Andr\u00e9s, I want to briefly discuss our expectations beyond 2016. On our fourth quarter call in February, we plan to provide guidance for 2017, as well as longer term expectations through at least 2019. At that point, we will have completed our annual budget process, and we\u2019ll be in a better position to provide more detailed guidance. Based on our preliminary view, we expect to be within the previously disclosed ranges for average annual growth through 2018.","As Andr\u00e9s discussed, the majority of our new projects are coming online in 2018, so we expect growth to be stronger in 2018 and 2017. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our previously disclosed ranges for expected growth in 2017-18 for both proportional free cash flow and adjusted EPS.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Tom. To summarize today\u2019s call, we have a portfolio of asset that is generating strong cash flow, and a construction and development pipeline that is driving growth in cash flow and earnings. We are well position to maximize shareholder value through the following. First, we are rebalancing our business mix by exiting certain businesses to reduce risk and redeploying our excess cash in growth projects with long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts, and focusing on less carbon intensive sources of generation.","Second we remain committed to continuing to strengthen our credit, which is largely driven by the successful completion of our construction program, cost reductions and de-levering. Accordingly, we remain confident that we can achieve investment grade stats by 2020. Third, we're capitalizing on our advantageous positive in key high growth markets, and we continue to expect double-digit growth in all key metrics through 2018. Furthermore, we believe that we are well placed to deliver attractive growth in cash flow and earnings beyond 2018.","With that, I would like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","So, on slide -- couple of things, slide 26, is that compared to the second quarter, so the comparable slide. I see that the only adjustment is that you're assuming that you articulated this in your script. I just wanted to be clear that some of the sales proceeds are slipping into 2017 from '16 otherwise, this slide is demonstrably unchanged?","Thomas O'Flynn","That's right Greg.","Greg Gordon","So, on the unallocated discretionary cash, you talked about one of the things you didn't talk about was significant further share repurchases, that was notably absent from the script. Is there -- was that on purpose?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, as Tom said, we see dividend as our primary way of getting cash back to our shareholders. On the other hand, we do have an approval. And we have shown in the past that if we think that's the best use of our cash, we will go ahead and buyback our shares. So, we're not taking it off the table, but we're saying our primary focus will be on paying and increasing, and growing dividend.","Greg Gordon","It's just, it's a very luxurious position you're in, and you don't have any maturities for a few years. And you're already growing the dividend at a pretty high articulated rate, and yet you still have all this unallocated cash. So, if I just, capital allocation is going to be top of mind when we quiz you at EI?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","They\u2019ll be good and it's great to be in a luxurious position. What I'm very glad is that, yes, we've been working on this for a long time because in terms of getting our debt in better shape. And we are in very good shape. And not only that, in terms of terms, length of the debt in terms of -- the majority of the debt is fixed and also it's in the currency of the operating business. So yes we will be talking about that, but that does give us options.","Greg Gordon","Two more quick questions, one I think you -- in reiterating your guidance, you've indicated that you're using curves for commodities and currencies from the middle of the year. If I add up all those, and how much they change over the course of since the middle of the year, I think the dollars moved in your favor, but commodities have moved against you. Net-net, it doesn't look like a big negative if anything, it might be a push. Can you comment on how those changes, how those curves have changed since June 30th?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Greg, you're basically right. They're basically flat. I don't know if Tom, you want to add something to that, but the net is flat.","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes, that\u2019s fair. ","Greg Gordon","And then in terms of the earnings drag associated with the Chile construction project, should we think about the earnings impact, as you\u2019re seeing the incremental cost of the debt on the cost overrun?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","This project will be coming-in in 2019, so it currently has no impact prior to that. We have to see again where we\u2019re negotiating now with lenders, how much is from the sponsors, how much is from the lenders and what are the conditions. So it really doesn\u2019t have any impacts through the 2018 window. And I would add to that Hahn Air has its earnings call later today, I think at 11 O\u2019clock, but they come out with their press release. And they had, I think, the best quarter in the last five years. So, Hahn Air is in strong position. But we have to address the issue at Alto Maipo. And as I said, we\u2019re working very constructively with our lenders and also with the construction company.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","First question I just wanted to clarify this comments you have made. When we look at the next couple of years, you have put out you said you reiterated the growth numbers well over 16% EPS growth, but this point about this being greater in \u201918 versus \u201817. Just wanted to understand that a little bit better, is the implication that \u201917 perhaps is lower than the 12% to 16%, but then you catch-up in \u201918 or that \u201917 is 12%, but \u201918 is 16%. I just wanted to understand what you were saying on that \u201917 versus \u201918 growth number?","Thomas O'Flynn","Ali, that\u2019s maybe little more fine tuning than we want to get to. At this point, we\u2019re clearly comfortable with the 12% to 16%. We think that \u201918 will be stronger than \u201917 we still think that \u201916 to \u201917 growth rate is going to be stronger and attractive. But I don\u2019t want to get into too much fine-tuning we\u2019ll certainly do that in Feb when we give formal guidance.","Ali Agha","But Tom, just to be clear, we should not assume that each year is 12% to 16%, we should assume that that\u2019s a cumulative \u201916 to \u201918 number?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes, cumulative or average, however you want to the math, yes.","Ali Agha","Okay.","Thomas O'Flynn","But there was growth just between \u201916 and \u201917 we\u2019ll put a fine point on growth each year in Feb.","Ali Agha","And then on Ohio, how concerned are you that there will be an evitable legal challenges to any approval you get, even for this distribution rider. What\u2019s kind of the basis on which you guys are confident that this thing will be sustained?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Ali, you always have a process and you have interveners. Having said that, we have the case of FirstEnergy, we just moved forward, we think our case is even more robust. So, we have a high degree of confidence of this moving forward.","Thomas O'Flynn","I\u2019d just say as it\u2019s a distribution monetization rider, we\u2019re very focused on doing it for the health of DP&L and for the T&E business. We think having a strong credit profile there is important and this will give us a trajectory to do that. And also, we do think that there is investment in the DP&L T&E business that would be good for customers and would also require capital. And that\u2019s one of the major components of and frankly uses of cash as we talk with the commission.","Ali Agha","And just to clarify the timing, you alluded to December 5th, the hearings, but you also have discussions. So is this something that potentially we could hear about a settlement before year-end, or should we expect Q1 when decisions and settlements and those kinds of things happen?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Ali, I think it's most likely Q1.","Ali Agha","Last question, Andr\u00e9s. You talked about contracts that are rolling off post '18. You've got stuff that's coming on at that time, as well. I know you'll provide more granularity in February, but just at a high level, when you look at your business over the next, call it four-five years, or 2021. You don't have much visibility and confidence in terms of -- can you sustain the growth rate that you've promised us through '18, or just high level? Or are you seeing more headwinds to slow things down?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Ali, we'll provide more color when we have our fourth quarter call in terms of expanding. But we feel confident of the growth rates that we have given, and we see continued growth rate pass that. We will get more specific into the future. But if you look at our construction programs, you have a lot of things coming online in '19 and '20. And also more discreet items like some of the renewables, such as solar, which we\u2019ll be growing and are quite frankly fully incorporated in some of the construction numbers we give, because they're much shorter periods between development and construction.","Ali Agha","Okay, thank you.","Thomas O'Flynn","Just to clarify one thing I'd said on DP&L, it's a distribution modernization rider. I think I said something other than monetization. It's a big word for me.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, can I just, maybe starting in on Ohio, following from the last question. Can you elaborate a little bit, is the structure analogous to what FirstEnergy recently approved? And then separately you talked about maintaining investment quality. What metrics that you saw going forward with the DMR and ultimately to get to those IG metrics?","Thomas O'Flynn","Just on DP&L, yes, it's similar. FE had some FFO ratios I think it was in 14.5%, it's similar to what we're using, so that's what gets us the $145 million of revenue requirements, or DMR I'll call it that we've requested. We are focused on seven years. They were shorter with an ability to extend, but we do think it's helpful to have a defined longer period, but that's certainly a matter of our discussions right now.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Turning to your longer term guidance, you talked about '18 being still intact. Can you reiterate your confidence in OPG C2, and maybe a just big uptime, as well as also just curious, Alto Maipo. I suppose it indicates back-half of '18. Is that a material contribution to '18 in terms of your confidence to hit that number?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Taking the first one, in terms of Alto Maipo, as I said, it has really no impact on 2018. So, I think the key thing is reaching an agreement with lenders and completing the project. Regarding OPG C2, we will give more information into the future. I think if we look at it as a project in India, that\u2019s overall going quite well. It's a complex project, it does have a rail tracks and coal mine. We\u2019ve got all the coal permits. We\u2019ve got most of the land permits. So in general it\u2019s proceeding well for project in India.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, you\u2019re confident in first half of \u201818?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We will update that and OPG C2. We\u2019re making overall good progress.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then coming back to Chile and just real quickly. Can you comment a little bit more about what you think -- I think your term was an appropriate level for new entry, and how you think that evolves here overtime. Obviously, the use of blocks rather than conventional PPAs really shifts the market dynamic there. Can you comment?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think what happened in Chile, it's two things. First, you have to realize that there were about $50 billion in mining projects in Chile. I\u2019d say we were looking back three-four years ago. And of those I think probably about $40 billion have been suspended. So, the growth and demand from the mining sector did not materialize, and those projects are on hold. So that really change the dynamics to give you a much higher reserve ratio in Chile than certainly any of the projections had been. So that\u2019s I think the most important thing to understand.","So, when there was this auction came in and there have been some changes to the auction process. What we saw was it was below, certainly, I think, consensus estimates. And basically came in on two sides. One was a new entrance on the renewable side. And also we believe on the hydro side, people bid lower than expected. I would say of the thermal bids, we were probably, we believe, the lowest. So we had I think a better view of that. What do we think is a sustainable level? Well, if you go to the market research in Chile today, so the sustainable level is north of $60, $60 a megawatt hour. If you look at where this auction cleared, it's more or like $47. There\u2019re issues here because you have to follow the load with intermittent renewables, and you have to put packages together.","So, we think that some of these assumptions, obviously, people are bidding for future prices of the capital investment future prices for other things. And there is a lot of assumptions here. So, we think that more in line with the consensus view overall. And one thing I would say is if these mining projects get reactivated, maybe even a third of them then the situation in Chile will change. Because you also should remember that the very high reserve margin that market had a lot of that is very old, is very old coal plant than other ones that are not efficient.","So, we think that that\u2019s reasonable. And that anyway the market moves though, I think that we are in a very good position having that existing thermal and hydro base to combine it with renewables, to be able to offer more secure load following supply.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then can you comment briefly on the Philippines and after market and this decision to pursue the expansion given, call it, broader pricing pressures that we\u2019ve seen in Chile, et cetera?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, different market. In the case of the Philippines, we saw that there was demand for our plant Masinloc and that we could add basically another unit to Masinloc and 325 megawatt is going to be super critical. And we could contract that at attractive prices. So, we started this. It's under-construction today. And Philippine market will change. What you have today is basically a lot of gas plants that are using domestic gas, which are basically first to be dispatched. So, there're base load.","When these contracts burn-off in the next couple of years, they go to mid merit. And quite frankly they may have to search for new sources of gas. So, given that this plant will be very well positioned. And basically I think that perhaps where you're going is that the new contracts we're signing for 10 and 20 years PPAs are at the same similar prices. And we basically have an extension on existing Masinloc at the same price with the off-taker. And it is pending regulatory approval, but we expect that to get approved.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Well, how contracted in the second year that you're building?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","The second year to-date is about 50%. But we expect to have it much more contracted by the time it's completed because it's not going to just one big distribution company, it's going to multiple.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lasan Johong of Auvila Research. Please go ahead.","Lasan Johong","Right now if you look at the valuation on AES, even if you ignored all the utilities, generation is trading at a $1,000 of KW, or that's what the market is telling us. Andr\u00e9s would you say this is enough, I'm going private, I'm going to take out AES and turn it into private company?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, I think that if you look at AES today, it's certainly been significantly de-risked, and certainly, I think, has a very attractive future growth profile. And I think that we're very well positioned. I think in terms of our valuation, I mean, we've had, quite frankly, a lot of headwinds over the last five years. Some external, whether it was droughts or commodity prices or FX. Now what we've done is take-out I think a lot of that risk as we go forward. So I think as we deliver on the growth prospects, and deliver on our construction program and certainly deliver on our cost cuts. Because, one of the things, we're today at a run-rate of $250 million less of overhead and general expenses that we were five years ago. So, I think all the trends are right. I certainly think that it's an issue of delivering on it and we should see valuations, which are more in line with our peers.","Lasan Johong","Tom, you mentioned that by 2020 AES should be in the investment grade metric area. Is the ambition for AES to try become an investment grade company? And if so, does that change the way AES looks at financing its business?","Thomas O'Flynn","I think we'll have a better idea of what the metrics will translate to from the agencies. We want to be careful. I don't want to be presume what their judgment would be, that's why we're trying to control, we can control. It's basically move our -- our ratios have gone from 6.5% to about 5%, and we to go to 4% or low 4s depending upon our business mix, the stability of the business. I don't think it'll materially change our business or financing strategy. I will say that we've done a lot, continue to do a lot to look ahead and refinance, take advantage of market windows, be at the parent, or really all throughout our subs.","The project finances or subsidiary finances that would be bundles. But one thing I\u2019d say is that we probably look to do bundles more than one-off deals where we can, and it still fits with the strategy. So, we\u2019re doing that in some places we\u2019ve got expansion right now in the Dominican Republic. But $250 million to close this cycle make a project thermal efficient on its gas usage. And that\u2019s being done. It's basically being bundled with our Andres plant. It\u2019s a very efficient plant. So, we\u2019re bundling those two together. So it means we don\u2019t put in equity, we basically use the equity value of the Andr\u00e9s to bundle that and alleviate equity requirements, and I\u2019ll suggest upgrade the credit packages. We\u2019re doing the same thing in the Philippines where new Masinloc is part of the credit package of the Philippines.","So, we\u2019ll look to do more of that. And I think especially as we go and look at some smaller renewables, we\u2019re doing some smaller renewables in the U.S. This year we\u2019ll do about almost 100. And those are the things that you really do bundled financing as opposed to project-by-project.","Lasan Johong","Last question, Andr\u00e9s. AES is going very deep and long into battery storage power. I\u2019m just wondering, because I\u2019m assuming battery power could be useful backup to renewables mostly, and to make sure good stability remains in place. But my understanding is that backup power is typically required for six to eight hour periods, and batteries generally don\u2019t give out too much more output than two to four hours. Is there a disconnect between what the objective of the battery is trying to do, and what actual reality is?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","What we\u2019re seeing, first, is this market is growing very quickly. So, we believe I think its next year we\u2019ll have about installations around the world around 1 gigawatt, and we\u2019re starting maybe two years ago at 200. So first it's growing very rapidly. And it\u2019s a technology that has many applications. I mean it has applications for capacity release. Those were some of our first project ancillary services. And you\u2019re right so the substituting taking plants where you have a lot of renewables. That\u2019s our big project in California. But it also has applications to the T&E business in terms of alleviating transmission constraint.","Now, part of the lithium-ion battery energy storage solutions, batteries are one component. So, we\u2019ve seen, over the last five years, battery prices were up by 65%. There is no technical reason you couldn\u2019t make it an eight hour if you wanted to. It\u2019s just a question that you have to put on more batteries and it becomes more expensive. So, we expect battery prices to continue to drop because these are the same batteries you use in electric vehicles. So, as that becomes massive fight, it should drop continually. So, we\u2019re projecting a continued drop in those prices. So, the duration is really a function of your battery price.","So, we are seeing that it\u2019s a many places the applications are more in the two to four hour today at today\u2019s battery prices, but you could extend those for a longer. And I think that, again, we\u2019re seeing a very rapid growth of demand. And again this year alone, we\u2019ve already closed $70 million in growth revenues from sales to third-parties that is sales to other people to play it on our grade. So, I\u2019m certain that this will continue to grow very quickly. I\u2019m also certain that price will drop. And what we\u2019re really trying to see is our two pronged approach where we put our Advancion product on our own platforms and use them to enhance our renewables or even enhance our thermal plant, and selling it to third-parties. Now that third-party sales we're using channel partners who have sales forces. And finally I would say that the combination of the two, whether we're driving it, we want to be the low cost provider and also quite frankly the best provider of this service. So, third party sales are helpful over the cost to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","So, first going back to the Alto Maipo project. Could you tell us how much of the capacity is going to be contracted? And if there's been any impact on your ability to contract the remainder of the project given the outcome of this August solar power auction?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, Angie. I think about 40% of the project is contracted today in long-term contract. And in terms of our ability to re-contract, I would say that obviously it will affect the price of any future contracts. When it was being built, the forecast for Chile quite frankly we\u2019re like a $100 a megawatt hour. And what we're seeing is more likely somewhere in the mid-60s, we think is probably a long-term price. So, you're right, the auction, but I think more than the auction, quite frankly, the dynamics in the market. Because, quite frankly, if you did have a rapid pick-up in the mining sector, I think that the prices would reverse.","Angie Storozynski","And now, you're assuming that the lenders basically cover the cost overruns. I mean, I am concerned here because it seems like you have fully committed your equity stake here. You've an increase in the cost of construction, and a reduction in revenues, because of the drop in power prices. So is there a scenario where you would actually consider walking away from this project?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","You're right. Certainly, the project looks less attractive today with the cost of overruns and the lower prices that it had initially. It was a very robust project to begin with. And in terms of our commitment to the project, we will look at this as in terms of what we think is the best decision for AES Gener. And obviously we have to reach the right agreement with the lenders to make this project better than not proceeding with the project. So that always remains an option and we're looking into that. But I think that mostly likely outcome is that we do complete the project.","Angie Storozynski","And then my second question is on capital allocation. So you aim at investment grade FFO to debt by 2020. So why not use the spare cash that you have, or the capital that is unallocated to actually reduce that debt in order to get to those investment grade metrics earlier? I mean, this is always an issue with the strength of your dividends that is somewhat undermined by this below investment grade rating.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think that's a great comment, Angie, something we discussed. We've been paying down the debt consistently try to take advantages of windows in the market. We also have the options of transforming our portfolio for the future, and so taking advantage of the platform. So, we have to balance those two. So obviously that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve looked at, what is the speed of the debt pay-downs that we should do. And what we think is important is to have a very clear north where we\u2019re going and to deliver on that. And as we do asset sales and as we see opportunities to add to our platform, we\u2019ll take that into consideration. But again, I think, we have a good track record in terms of consistently improving our credit profile, de-risking and cutting our cost.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Russo of Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","Brian Russo","And so 25 you guys outline the debt parent free cash flow plus interest ratios, I\u2019m just curious what kind of your 2020 target and to get to an investment grade like ratings? And are there other ratios that we should be tracking?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","This is the primary one. The target would be around 4%, but it's depending upon, obviously, business mix and those kind of things. But generally it's around 4%, it should be a combination of parent free cash flow growth, which will be the strongest contributor, as well as some continued debt pay-down.","Brian Russo","And I think you mentioned earlier to offset some of the first-half \u201916 headwinds, your effective tax rate is a little bit lower. Is that accurate, and then what\u2019s driving that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah, that\u2019s what we\u2019re -- there were two things I mentioned that would be offsets. One is a specific tax matter that would cause our tax rate to be lower. I think we had a range of 29 to 32, and the tax would be at the lower end of the range. And then the other would be specific settlement of a commercial issue.","Brian Russo","And then with your portfolio management initiatives, what regions should we consider non-core or some countries or assets that you\u2019re currently evaluating?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Brian, that\u2019s always a very delicate question for us, because we\u2019re operating in these markets. I think in the case of Brazil, when we I think foreshadowed that we had a lot of hydrology risk in Brazil. So, with the sale of AES Sul, we think it\u2019s better balances our portfolio. You may ask, why the hydrology risk, or regulatory risk at AES Sul, quite frankly, when you have droughts and you have an increase in energy prices, because they\u2019re running more thermal, there isn\u2019t an immediate pass-through to the distribution company. So quite frankly that puts pressure on our distribution companies in terms of cash.","So, we think there\u2019re main drivers of our value creations as strong cash flow, having less assets in distribution in Brazil, would make our cash flow more stable as we redeploy that cash. So, I\u2019d say it\u2019s clear with our core markets, which we\u2019re going after, I mean, the markets we\u2019re most interested in. And again, those markets where we can get long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts will have preference. I mean, we can\u2019t get it everywhere. But we want to shift the portfolio again more contracted and with a lower carbon footprint. And that\u2019s what you can see going forward.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

And welcome to the AES Corporation's Second Quarter 2019 Financial Review Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. Also note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha. Please go ahead sir.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Nancy. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2019 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior management of our management team.","With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2019 financial review call. I am pleased to report that based on our year-to-day results and our expected growth in the second half of the year, we are on track to achieve our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with the midpoint of $1.34 and our apparent free cash flow target with the midpoint of $725 million. We are also confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022.","Turning to slide four, since our last call, we have continued to make great progress on our three key strategic objectives. These are; first, becoming investment grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio. Second, positioning the company for sustained growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects, and third, improving our competitiveness by deploying innovative technologies.","Now allow me to provide some color on each one, starting with our first objective of becoming investment grade and enhancing the resilience of our portfolio on slide five. We have already achieved a key investment grade metric and we are on track to attain investment grade ratings in 2020.","Our improved credit metrics reflect the growth of our free cash flow paying down 43% of our recourse debt and an almost 70% decrease in our exposure to foreign currencies, commodities and hydrology over the past eight years. A good example of this last point is bringing LNG to Panama with the commissioning of the AES Col\u00f3n Terminal and combined cycle power plant.","This new facility has reduced our exposure to poor hydrology in Panama by 70% by providing far less expensive energy to supply our hydro PPAs in times of drought, such as occurred in 2014 and is occurring again this year. It is not only good for AES but it is expected to save Panama more than $400 million a year in imported fuel expenses.","We are further enhancing the resilience of our portfolio by decreasing our carbon intensity. This year alone we have announced the sale of 2.4 gigawatts of thermal generation in Northern Ireland, Jordan and Oklahoma.","As you can see on Slide six, as a result of our actions, we expect to reduce our carbon intensity by 50% from 2016 levels by 2022. By that date, we also expect that coal will represent less than 30% of our total generation by megawatt hour.","Now to our second objective, positioning the company for sustainable growth by increasing our backlog of contracted projects, beginning on Slide seven. We now have a backlog of 6.8 gigawatts of mostly renewable projects. This number encompasses projects under construction or with sign PPAs, all of which are expected to be online by 2023.","We are now on track to become one of the five largest renewable developers in the world outside of China. As we discussed on our last call, we expect to sign two to three gigawatts of renewables per year, split roughly 50\/50 between wind and solar, and likewise, between the U.S. and international.","So far this year, we have signed 1 gigawatt of renewable PPAs including about 500 megawatts since our last call. This new capacity includes 181 megawatts of renewable energy signed in Chile as part of our Green Blend and Extend strategy. Through this win-win approach, we preserve the value of our existing contracts, while replacing a portion of thermal energy with long term contracted renewables.","In exchange, our customers receive carbon free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, while still benefiting from reliable capacity provided by thermal generation. We expect to see meaningful progress on the Green Blend and Extend opportunity in the coming months.","Now to our projects under construction, beginning on Slide eight. Of the 4.5 gigawatts currently under construction, 43% are renewables. This percentage will continue to grow as we complete the large conventional thermal plants we started a number of years ago, while adding new wind, solar and energy storage. We are particularly pleased with the speed at which we have been able to transition projects from development to construction.","Now onto Slide nine, we are reaching key milestones on our conventional projects under construction. We have completed the construction of our OPGC 2 plant in India with one unit already on line and the second unit in the final commissioning phase.","Our Southland repowering project in California continues to progress well, and is now approximately 95% complete. We recently achieved first fire and the project is on track to come on line in the first quarter of next year, ahead of our original schedule.","I'm also pleased to announce that just yesterday the storage tank at our AES Col\u00f3n LNG re gasification facility in Panama came online, replacing the temporary floating storage unit we had been using.","Turning to Slide 10, our Alto Maipo hydroelectric project in Chile is advancing as planned, and is now approximately 80% complete. As you may remember, tunneling is the most difficult aspect of construction, and we now have completed 36 miles with only five miles to go until initial COD.","Additionally, we broke ground on a 10-megawatt energy storage project that will serve as the first virtual reservoir in the world. This innovative project is for our Alfalfal hydro plant which is part of the Alto Maipo complex. It will store five hours of energy during periods of low demand, and inject that energy into the grid during hours of peak demand, providing the run of the River plant with many of the same capabilities as a reservoir.","We have the potential to increase a virtual reservoir by another 240 megawatts of five hour energy storage at the Alto Maipo complex.","Turning to Slide 11. Another component of our contracted growth strategy is investing in LNG, which we see as complementary to our renewables business. Not only does LNG displace heavy fuel oil and diesel with less volatile cheaper and cleaner natural gas, but the investments are based on long term tolling agreements with no direct commodity risk.","I have previously mentioned that once our LNG import terminals and re gasification facilities are built, they can be scaled up at a relatively low cost, as much of the key infrastructure is already in place. We are working on expanding our LNG storage capacity in the Dominican Republic by 50 tera BTUs. We have already signed or are in advanced negotiations for third tera BTUs of this additional capacity under long term contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES and it's expected to be completed by 2022. Once fully contracted this expansion will provide $0.02 of incremental EPS. This is up and above the $0.03 of potential upside at our existing LNG facilities in the region we had already discussed.","In Vietnam, we're making excellent progress toward the development of a landmark project with 450 tera BTUs of LNG storage and 2 gigawatts of combined cycle power plants. We expect to achieve this critical milestone this year, and once completed, this project will be an important contributor to our earnings growth beyond 2022.","Now to our third strategic objective of deploying new technologies to maintain our market leading positions, beginning on Slide 12. We are complementing and enhancing our current businesses by incorporating digital capabilities and by growing in adjacent areas.","As we discussed on our last call, by applying new digital initiatives and analytics across our $33 billion asset base, this is a primary driver of our $100 million annual cost savings initiative. We are on track to fully achieve these savings by 2022.","One example of our investment in new technologies is our energy storage business. We are now the undisputed global leader in the sector, as both an owner of projects and through Fluence, the energy storage provider that we jointly own with Siemens.","Fluence has now surpassed 1 gigawatt of projects either awarded or delivered, including more than 400 megawatts of projects awarded in the first half of 2019 alone. With the current backlog of nearly $700 million and a growing pipeline of activity, Fluence is cash positive, self-funding, and has the potential to rapidly increase in value as demand for energy storage accelerates.","Now to Slide 13. Another example is our investment in Simple Energy, a company that provides utility customers a marketplace for energy efficiency products. There is great demand for digital solutions that enable energy users to be more efficient and Simple Energy has grown even faster than we anticipated.","Since our last call, Simple Energy has merged with other companies to form a new company called, Uplight. Uplight is now the market leader in providing cloud based energy solutions in the United States serving 85 electric and gas utilities with more than 100 million customers.","Through this transaction, the implied value of our equity and simple energy nearly doubled in a little over a year since our initial investment. In digital business, such as Uplift is capital light, largely self-funding and we expect Uplights annual revenue to grow significantly from its current base of over $100 million.","Finally, turning to Slide 14. AES\u2019s success as a technology leader was recently recognized when we were awarded our industry's top honor, EEI's Edison award. We were honored for our innovation in advancing round the clock renewables at our Kaua\u2019i solar plus storage project which is already operational in Hawaii.","We see renewables plus storage as an increasingly important for our sector, and AES is well-positioned to gain significant market share in this space.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail.","Gustavo Pimenta","Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Today, I\u2019ll go over our financial results, outlook for 2019 and capital allocation. Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance-to-date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.","As shown on slide 16, in the second quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.26 primarily reflecting higher contributions from the U.S. and a lower tax rates. This was partially offset by the impact of asset sales as well as planned outages in Panama and Northern Ireland.","In the second half, we expected to post stronger results as we benefit from the plant in Panama returning to operations. Our continued cost savings initiatives and two gigawatts of new projects reaching COD.","Turning to Slide 17, adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC was $240 million for the quarter, a decrease of $15 million. I\u2019ll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on slide 18.","In the U.S. & Utilities SBU, increased PTC reflects the resolution of regulated rate cases last year, contributions for new renewable projects and higher energy sales at Southland. These impacts were partially offset by the exits of coal-fired generation at the DPL and Shady Point.","Regarding DPLs DMR extension filing there is not much to report, but we remain on track for an expected ruling in 2020, and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPL recently filed a plan to transform its electric grid, while continued to meet the energy needs of its customers, with improved service reliability, efficiency and safety.","The plan calls for $1.2 billion of CND [ph] investment over seven years, with a tracking mechanism recovering 80% of this cost between rate base. AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan would be a key component of the mid-single digit rate base growth we have discussed it in the past.","A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020. At our South America SBU, lower PTC was largely driven by lower generation and energy pricing in Colombia, as well as lower volumes in Chile. Lower PTC at our Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean are MCAC SBU reflects an extended plant outage for maintenance and repairs at our Changuinola hydro plant in Panama.","Finally in Eurasia, lower results primarily planned outages achieved and the shutdown of 300 megawatt of capacity at Ballylumford in Northern Ireland. In mid-June we closed the sale of this businesses for total proceeds of $120 million.","In Bulgaria, there have been no significant developments since our last call. Our plant continues to be dispatched reinforcing its criticality to the Bulgarian grid and we are being paid on time.","Lastly, we recently took advantage of strong market demand for infrastructure projects in Vietnam to refinance $1.1 billion of project at [Indiscernible]. The issuance was four times oversubscribed and enabled us to lower our interest rate, while improving financial flexibility. This is just another example of our continued liability management effort across our portfolio, capitalizing on a low interest rate environment.","Now to slide 22, to summarize our performance in the first half of the year, we earned adjusted EPS of $0.53 versus $0.52 last year. Relative to 2018, we expect strong growth in the second half of 2019, primarily driven by contributions for new businesses, continued cost savings initiatives, and the timing of our major outages, particularly in Panama and the Dominican Republic.","As you may have seen in our press release, we are reaffirming the $1.34 midpoint of our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance. We are also nearing the range by $0.04 to $1.28 \u2013 from $1.28 to $1.40 to $1.30 to $1.38 given our confidence in the outlook for the second half of the year.","I will also highlight that we -- we are reaffirming our 2019 parent free cash flow target of $700 million to $750 million. Turning to 2019 Parent Capital allocation on slide 23. Beginning on the left hand side, sources reflect $1.1 billion of total discretionary cash including $725 million of parent free cash flow.","Sources also consider $369 million in assets sale proceeds, which include Northern Ireland, and this sPower\u2019s sell down, both of which have closed, as well as Jordan, which were expected to close by year end.","Now to uses on the right hand side, including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December, we'll be returning $361 million to shareholders this year. We expect to allocate another $150 million to parent debt paydown largely to strengthen our investment grade metrics, and we plan to invest $450 million in our subsidiaries, leaving about $200 million of unallocated cash.","Finally moving to our capital location from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 24. We expect our portfolio to generate $4 billion in discretionary cash, which is about 35% of our current market cap. About 80% of this cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sales proceeds, about half of which has been announced or closed this year.","In addition to this, we are making very good progress on the third party capital initiative we have discussed previously, and expect the formal announcement later this year. As we have said before, the goal is to provide a more systematic and cost effective source of capital that would be incremental to the $4 billion I just mentioned.","Turning to the uses of the discretionary cash on slide 25, roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year in line with the industry average. We plan to use $300 million for debt reduction, half of which we expected to complete in 2019. The other half will be used to maintain credit neutrality as we pursue the remaining planet asset sales.","We are also expecting to use $1.5 billion for our equity investments in our backlog and projected PPAs, and an additional $200 million to fund T&D investments at IPL was completed all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $470 million of unallocated cash will be used in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Gustavo. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. In the first half of the year, we made very good progress on our strategic objectives and expect to accomplish significant milestones in the remainder of the year. We are enhancing the resilience of our portfolio, and we are on track to attain investment grade ratings in 2020.","We are increasing our backlog of long term contracted projects. The sustained profitable growth, including advancing renewables and LNG infrastructure, and we are deploying innovative technologies to maintain our competitive edge and market leading positions.","Accordingly, we are confident in our ability to achieve our 2019 guidance. We're also confident that we will deliver 7% to 9% growth in cash flow and adjusted earnings per share through 2022.","Therefore, we believe AES offers a compelling investment thesis, yielding double-digit total returns that will serve our investors well for years to come. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Angie Storozynski from Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. So first on Ohio, the DMR for DPL is still being challenged at the court. And secondly, given the successful challenge of percentages, DMR. Just wondering, if there is a way to either adjust the current rider that the DPL is collecting, and also have some improvements to the one that you were requesting to have extended so that it's not just susceptible to future legal challenges.","Gustavo Pimenta","Hi Angie, Gustavo here. So just to provide a little bit of detail here. And so while it\u2019s been challenged in the court is not the legality of the DMR. So we have a very specific and narrow claim there. The discussion is around if the DMR should be included or not in the SEET test. So from our perspective and there are precedents in Ohio in which charge similar to the DMR should not be included in the seat best. So we feel -- we feel good about that. In any case, we don't think this is a binary outcome, right. So we have to run this through the SEET test at the end to see what is the final impact. And you know, our view is that decision will probably become coming towards year end. But again, it's not a challenging regarding the legality of the demand, that's a very important clarification.","The extension is a separate discussion, right. So, we've got the initial three years under the assumption that would be very specific in terms of the uses of the proceeds. So we've done, we've used 100% of the proceeds for that pay down. We brought -- we brought the complex back to investment grade, and from our perspective, it is necessary to secure the extension for the complex to maintain the investment grade, in position DPL for grid modernization.","You may recall we filed last year an investment on his smart grid and for us to continue with those investments. It's fundamental that we secured an extension. So we feel, we have a good case, but that will have to run its two process.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And moving on to your cash value of allocation. So just wanted to make sure that the $395 million of proceeds from asset sales is independent of this pending process, where you're trying to raise third party capital and on the latter, given the low and falling interest rate environment, if you could comment if that is actually somewhat beneficial to the process either you're seeing actually more demand for partial sell down of equity of your operating assets and future assets.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, hi Angie, this is Andr\u00e9s. Yes, as we said this initiative is additional. It in no way affects the $395 million. It's progressing well, as Gustavo said. And you know stay tuned for developments in the latter half of the year. I would add that this is not like if we don't do this, we\u2019ve already raised $3 billion of partner capital at very good rates. So what we're trying to do here is, do it in a more systematic and predictable way. But in either case, we have additional upside from incorporating partners into our businesses.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ali Agha from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","AliAgha","Thank you. Good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Ali.","AliAgha","Good morning, Andr\u00e9s. My first question I did want to come back to Ohio if I could. I hear the point you make that hey, you know the Supreme Court challenge for you is specific to the SEET test. Nevertheless, you know there is a Supreme Court decision in the state that you know basically went against the validity of the FE DMR. So there's a possibility that eventually something like that challenge happens to your DMR as well if it\u2019s not happening today. So can you just simply summarize for us why you think your DMR would be different and should be treated differently than the way FE\u2019s DMR is being treated?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, I think, I mean it's very objective here. We've --that's not the discussion in our case, right. So discussion again in our case is regarding the SEET test and not the legalities, so that is not in this court today.","AliAgha","I get that. I get that when I think of \u2026","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think the potential implications would be for potential discussion on the extension of the DMR, which I think it's a more fundamental discussion if the DMR should exist or not. And again, we do believe we have a very good case when we got the first, but very clearly if you read the outcome there, one of the discussion is if the proceeds are clearly defined in terms of the uses. In the case of DPL this was very clearly defined. We used 100% for that paydown, so a lot of the fundamentals that were discussed in the other case. From our perspective, our solid from a DPL standpoint and again we need that from our perspective to maintain the investment grade and position DPL for grid mode.","Gustavo Pimenta","Yes Ali, I think what's very important is also for you know for Dayton to have a grid equal to the other grids in Ohio. It needs an investment grade company and that is all wrapped together in this request for an extension of the DMR.","AliAgha","Okay, separately Andr\u00e9s can you also give us an update on what you're seeing in Puerto Rico right now with the political turmoil there any impact at all on your plant or your project out there?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes. Puerto Rico has been through you know removal of the governor and they are in the process of appointing a new governor. Look, whatever occurs will continue to be very important for Puerto Rico. We have the most reliable and by far the cheapest energy on the island. To replace our coal plant in Puerto Rico, by burning heavy fuel oil, which is what the other plants mainly burn, besides some gas would cost about an additional $300 million to $400 million a year in imported fuel bills. So Puerto would have to pay an additional $300 million to $400 million per year, which will be passed on to consumers. I think what's also very important is of the large plants. There are only two which are EPA compliant. Most of the plants in Puerto Rico because they're burning heavy fuel oil have excess emissions of sacs, so they're not EPA compliant. And for that reason the air in San Juan and Ponce, the two main cities is not compliant.","So while there's been some you know noise of about our coal ash on the island, really this this plant is very necessary. You know we're working with the PREPA to see about green blend and extend as a way of reducing total emissions, you know emissions on the island. And we'll continue to work with them. So stay tuned. And you know this plant is important. It is producing the most reliable and the cheapest energy on the island.","AliAgha","Okay. And last question Andr\u00e9s you know the 395 million of remaining asset sales. Is the goal there still to exit out of non-core assets as part of that process, or is that more driven by partial sell downs of existing assets to rake in recycled capital. Are you thinking about the remaining assets sale process?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well we have a number of objectives. So clearly, we have an objective of reaching less than 30% of our total generation by megawatt hour coming from coal. So you know that's something that we will keep in mind. We'll also keep in mind you know those markets which we think are growing most quickly and of course we've also been I think very successful in improving our returns for example even on renewables, by incorporating partner. So there's a combination of factors. But yes, obviously, reducing our carbon footprint will be one consideration in our additional sell downs.","AliAgha","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon from Evercore. Please go ahead sir.","Greg Gordon","Thanks guys. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Sorry to beat a dead horse on the DMR. I already understood that the nuances of your legal situation. But can you just tell us even though you in all rights you need this money to fulfill the capital needs of the distribution utility in Ohio, and should get the approval. Is your 7% to 9% expected earnings growth rate resilient to a negative outcome in that case?","Gustavo Pimenta","The answer is yes.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Just to compliment Greg, just to compliment, I think you may recall first Q we have announced the additional $100 million of potential cost savings from digital, which was not in the 7 to 9. So you see that now our forecast has really resilience to manage some of the negative outcome. Having said that, we expect it to get the DMR extension.","Greg Gordon","Right. And then my second question was with regard to Vietnam. You talked about how you're pleased with the movement towards potential realization of commercial opportunity there. I think, you know some of your investors are a bit skittish as it pertains to really large bets on highly concentrated investments out in Asia. So if this does come to a become a really viable commercial opportunity, do you see bringing in partners? How would you like decide that investment vis a-vis your overall capital business for AES.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes. Well you know of course we have a portfolio view of our capital and we don't want excessive concentration in any one particular market outside of the U.S. So I would say that to look at what we did with our Mong Duong facility in Vietnam, where we have been very successful. We were paid on time, it's a dollar contract. We're viewed as the premier operator and developer and builder of projects in Vietnam.","So in that case, we didn't have an over concentration of capital. So in the case of Vietnam, we may have Vietnamese partners from the get go. But you know we'll be conscious of that. But I think it's moving very well and as you know Vietnam is a place where it takes time to develop the projects, because you require government consensus from many entities. But you know we're well on our way. So we feel very confident about this project, and you know we'll obviously we'll be conscious about over concentration in one country.","Greg Gordon","Great. My last question is with regard to Fluence, I think that there was an incident where the technology had some issues in Arizona several months ago. Was that an isolated event or have there been improvements or modifications to the design of your of your offering as a result of that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes this occurred in a two megawatt facility in Arizona. We've been working with the battery manufacturer, and the utility in that case, really investigating all the root causes and looking at all our facilities. I would say that we've taken a real prudent steps based on that, realize that we're now coming out with our fifth generation of energy storage, which will be a cube and it has all the latest safety requirements. For example, the state of New York, which is it's 95 48 and in addition to that realized that you know we continue to see very strong demand for Fluence even the operator of the one unit that did have that incident, we continue to go forward.","So looking at that, we think this is something that there was some earning, we're working again with the battery supplier to really look at what was the root cause. And we're incorporating all learnings and we will have what we have, you know quite frankly, you know the safeties and most up to date units out in in operation, and in construction.","Greg Gordon","Thank you guys, have a great morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey good morning, Kim.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey. So I just wanted to follow up a little bit different from from other here. First, just with respect to Vietnam and then just what's the latest progress on an LNG contract in there? What should we be expecting going into the fourth quarter here, anything in particular? And then separately, you mentioned IPL. There have been some issues in Indiana around these RP processes of late. Can you comment about what kind of generation shifts are reflected in that 1.2 billion. Would that be potentially incremental? Are you thinking about anything? I know that some of the modeling scenarios that have been released by IPL have talked about this a little bit, so just that if you can't on those two big capital budgeting items here.","And then separately as the second question, I'll just ask you now, can you comment a little bit on the PTC contributions and the year-over-year increases from the renewables segment and how you're thinking about that scaling through the course of the year so I'll leave it there?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay let's take this multifaceted question part by part. I think regarding Vietnam, as you know when President Trump visited Vietnam, there was a letter of intent signed for this project, and it was you know I'll take one of the marquee projects that the two countries had agreed to. So Energy Demand in Vietnam is growing around 10%. Quite frankly, Vietnam is one of the beneficiaries of some of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China. So expect demand to grow even faster.","Vietnam does not have sufficient domestic LNG, doesn't even have sufficient coal, and so it's Vietnam is moving towards LNG and renewables as well. So this is a very necessary project. It's going to start supplying not only the new combined cycle gas plants, which are part of this initiative, but existing ones, which are running out of offshore gas as well. So I think it's very necessary. It's also a project, it's very important for both countries for the U.S. and for Vietnam.","So that the next things as you know expect no further progress in terms of you know announcements is a between the two countries and us that this is going to be moving forward with. And you know what Vietnamese partners are involved. Vietnam is a country of consensus as I said. So it takes time. But they move and they move in a very steady but very certain fashion. So that's what I would say sort of stay tuned, and it will of course. We have to -- we are part of the Vietnamese government's master electricity plant and that will also involve you know how much LNG is imported. And you know the phasing in of the combined cycle plants.","On the second, I will pass this to Gustavo, what I would say is a big part of the $1.2 billion at IPL is actually to \u2013 and so it\u2019s a smart grid infrastructure. So I'll pass it to Gustavo.","Gustavo Pimenta","That's right. So Julien, Gustavo here. Yes. The 1.2 is all T&D. So you're the team is looking for opportunities on the generation side, but it's not in this number yet. So this is it's in the works. On your third question, regarding their renewable contribution in this quarter was not that material around the cent. And as we bring new projects on line towards your end, then we'll have an additional contribution.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Just to clarify quickly, just on the PTC contribution for renewables, should we expect a material tax credit benefit in 4Q here to be kind of a big year of your uptake. ","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Not material, but some contribution, but not material.","Gustavo Pimenta","Yes, Julien, I -- just just remind you that remember that we were split 50\/50 between solar and wind, and we split 50\/50 between U.S. and international. So you know something like HLBV is not as important for us as it is for other people.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And just finally to read between the lines with IPL, we shouldn't expect anything too different from that 1.2 for the RFP process for the time being?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","The things we are still working on that one. So that this 1.2 was exclusively on T&D and we are looking for opportunities on the RFP and we'll come back to you as we as we get this. Put this to bed.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay. All right. Stay tuned. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","Hi. Good morning. On Fluence, its certainly an emerging technology that we're still going down the cost curve. Andr\u00e9s, would you say that your margins are holding -- per megawatt or however you measure it as this technology progresses down the cost curve.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Look I would say that the sales margin you know certainly are holding their different margins for different businesses. You know obviously we're in 20 countries today. We're selling you know for example in the Philippines where you have many isolated positions. You have different applications such as community solar, you had where frankly SunFlex, which is slightly different project product than our advancing product. So you know the margins will differ depending on the market depending on the exact product. But basically, we see the cost curve coming down, because as we come up with our next generation of product here, it's going to be more productized, it's going to be more prefab and it's going to be less customized as we've learnt more about what is optimal for our customers in different situations, so more customization will be on the software and less will be on the hardware.","So I would say expect margins to continue to improve. Not not actually go down even though you know we're seeing some you know in some cases you know people are bidding very low prices for the integration of energy storage. Basically to say that, they have an approved product up and operating in many of those cases we don't. We don't compete because you know we would do require margin from our projects.","Charles Fishman","Sure. And then one last quick question. The virtual reservoir, Alto Maipo, how is that different from pump storage, and doesn't involve any of the Fluence technology?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good question. It's absolutely Fluence technology. So basically it changes. It differs from pump storage, well pump storage you need a reservoir. You've got to put that water somewhere, and you know you have to build pipelines and you have to use electricity get it up there. And so, there's friction, just the physics of storing electrons is superior to that of storing molecules. So the virtual dam is basically the idea to combine a run of the river facility such as you know the whole Alto Maipo complex is about 750 megawatts. And then you have associated energy storage.","Now if you have only five hour storage, what I would remind people that means it's five hours at 100% discharge. If you discharge it at 50% you actually have energy storage capabilities for 10 hours. So what this will allow is you know the run of the river is constant. And what we will do doing is injecting energy into the grid when the prices are best.","That's basically it. And really providing capacity. I mean the one big issue with renewables is that they don't really provide you around the clock capacity. So this will provide us you know our run of the river does have actually run around the clock capacity, but this will allow us to inject that energy when it's most needed. So this is a very exciting technology and it will be I'm sure copied. And if we end up with a 250 megawatt five hour facility at the Alto Maipo complex, that makes the economics much more attractive.","Charles Fishman","That is fascinating. I would think that in the U.S. with the hydro and all the hydro we have but the limited opportunity to expand that might be a potential market if you can drive the Fluence cost down. Is that correct?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, that's absolutely correct. I mean, we actually are have people looking at the virtual Hydro in places like India, because realize that nowadays getting the environmental permits to construct a reservoir you know that often means forest clearance. That means relocating people, is very difficult. These you can install you know within 12 months.","So you know really the only barrier is getting the regulations in place as many on getting the proper capacity payments for this to work in and of course it works best in situations where you have a big penetration of solar for example. So you have that really that duck curve that you can take advantage of.","Charles Fishman","Okay. Thanks Andr\u00e9s. I can see why you're so excited about Fluence. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I do.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Horn in Russia for any closing remarks.","Ahmed Pasha","Thanks everybody for joining us on today's call.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, if you are listening to the webcast please mute your computer speakers before asking questions. Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Brendan. Good morning and welcome to AES's second quarter 2017 financial review call.","Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2017 financial review call.","Today, I will discuss our financial results and provide updates on our projects under construction, capital allocation, and cost savings. These actions are the foundation of our expected 8% to 10% average annual growth in earnings and cash flow. Since our previous call in early May, we have made significant progress on a number of key objectives for 2017.","At the same time, we experienced a setback at one of our construction projects Alto Maipo in Chile. I will discuss Alto Maipo in detail in a moment, but first I would like to highlight our accomplishments since the first quarter call.","In the second quarter, better availability and lower Parent interest contributed to an $0.08 improvement in our adjusted EPS of $0.25.","Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook, we are reaffirming our 2017 guidance and expectations through 2020. We successfully completed the expansion of our DPP gas-fired plant in the Dominican Republic.","We secured $2 billion in non-recourse financing on favorable terms and make ground on our 1.4-gigawatt Southland Repowering project in California. With the exception of the 531-megawatt Alto Maipo project, our 4.7 gigawatts under construction are progressing well, and remain on track to be completed through 2020.","We closed the acquisition of sPower, the largest independent solar developer in United States, to increase our long-term contracted U.S. dollar-denominated renewable portfolio. To take advantage of our leadership position in energy storage, we announced a 50-50 joint venture with Siemens, to create a global energy storage technology and services company. We are on track to achieve our $400 million per year cost reduction and revenue enhancement program.","Not turning to Alto Maipo on slide four. As we've discussed in the past, the project has experienced construction difficulties, resulting in projected cost over and above to 22%. Since our previous call in May, productivity by the construction contractors has been slower than anticipated. And Alto Maipo terminated one of the projects contractors for performance reasons.","Nonetheless, construction of the project is continuing and Alto Maipo has been engaged in discussions with potential replacement contractors and the non-recourse lenders to address these challenges.","The Alto Maipo project is looking for modified construction contracts and flexibility in financing terms. But it is uncertain efforts will ultimately be successful.","Having said that, I would like to emphasize that. First, our total exposure to the project is approximately $415 million. 87% of which has already been invested. Second, as we were for the challenges at Alto Maipo, we will be disciplined when it comes to the valuating any incremental investment from ASN [ph] in Alto Maipo. And third, we do not expect any material impact on our 2017 guidance and expectations through 2020. As we had already substantially reduced our expectations from Alto Maipo, when we provided our long-term outlook in May.","The developments at Alto Maipo are obviously very disappointing. As over the past five years, we have completed 6 gigawatts of projects on time and on budget.","Turning now to the rest of our construction program, beginning on slide five. We recently completed the 122-megawatt expansion of our DPP gas-fired plant in the Dominican Republic. By closing the cycle DPP now has 358 megawatts of capacity. There will be one of the lowest cross generators in the Dominican Republic. The additional 122 megawatts are contracted under long-term U.S. dollar-denominated PPA. The budget cost of $260 million was a 100% funded through non-recourse set at AES Dominicana.","Next, turning to our 671-megawatt Eagle Valley CCGT in Indiana, on slide six. We remain confident there is a project we'll achieve commercial operations in line with our prior expectation of the first half of 2018.","The EPC contractor, CBI has created positive momentum by subcontracting some of the critical work and right now there are presently a thousand workers onside. CBI is working to achieve substantial completion by year-end 2017.","Now turning to our 1.4-gigawatt Southland Repowering project in California, on slide seven. As you know, the 2.3 billion Southland Repowering project is a key component of our strategic objective to increase our U.S. dollar based long-term contracted position.","In June, we issued $2 billion in non-recourse step with the 4.5% yield and the 14-year average life. This financing demonstrates the strength of the project, which has 20 years PPAs with Southern California Edison.","The project not only includes the 1.3 gigawatts of gas-fired capacity, but also includes a 100 megawatt of 4-hour duration energy storage. 400 megawatt hours. Making it the largest energy storage facility in the world as well as the largest non-recourse financing ever that includes battery-based energy storage.","The Southland CCGT will be constructed by Kiewit under fixed price turnkey EPC contracts. Kiewit is one of North America's largest engineering and construction contractors with the successful track record of completing similar projects in California. We recently broke ground on the project and expect completion in the first half of 2020.","Turning to slide eight. As I said earlier, a site from Alto Maipo, we are making good progress across all of our construction projects, including our thermal plant OPGC2 in India and our CCGT and LNG regasification terminal, Col\u00f3n in Panama. These projects will be a key contributor to our earnings and cash flow grow through 2020.","Beyond our current construction program, we're primarily focusing our growth investments on natural gas and renewable projects with long-term US dollar-denominated contracts. This will contribute to our growth in our cash flow and earnings, will also reducing our average carbon intensity. To that end over the last few months, we have made significant problems towards re-positioning our portfolio.","Specifically, as you can see on slide nine, we completed the acquisition of 1.7 gigawatts, which includes sPower 1.3 gigawatts of solar and wind projects in the United States. We also recently closed on the acquisition of 386 Alto de Sert\u00e3o spinning wind farm in Brazil. This project will help diversify Tiet\u00ea's fuel mix and hydrological risk.","With an average remaining contract life of 18 years, the project will also help to reduce future exposure to short-term price movements. These 600 million Real acquisitions, was funded entirely with debt capacity at Tiet\u00ea. With these acquisitions, AES is operating renewable portfolio increases to 9 gigawatts for approximately one-quarter of our durable portfolio.","Finally, through our efforts to capitalize on our development pipeline across our portfolio, we expect at least 1.5 gigawatts of solar and wind through 2020. In fact, we have already signed PPAs per 400 megawatts and we're in exclusive negotiations for another gigawatt. We have sufficient internally generated cash to fund our equity contribution for both our projects under construction and the development projects I just discussed.","Turning to our energy storage business on slide 10, ten years ago we saw market need and created and deployed the first utility scale lithium iron batter on the grid. Since then we have remained a market leader having 476 megawatts of energy storage deployed or under contract in seven countries.","Today, the world-wide install base per energy storage is around 3 gigawatts. But it is projected to grow to 28 gigawatts over the next five years, as energy storage prices decline and the penetration of intermittent renewable increases. To take advantage of our leadership position and this unique market opportunity, in July we're joining forces with Siemens, to create Fluence, a global energy storage technology and services company.","The new 50-50 joint venture combines the scale, experience and resources of AES and Siemens and will offer both AES advance and Siemens sea storage battery based energy storage platforms. Fluence will continue to develop new storage solutions and services while leveraging the reach of Siemens global salesforce, which is active in more than 160 countries. The joint venture is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year following regulatory approvals.","Finally, turning to slide 11 and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative, as you know since 2012, we have achieved an annual run rate savings rate of $215 million. We are on track to achieve $50 million of incremental cost savings in 2017 and our $400 million run rate target by 2020.","There are a number of work streams that we've established to capture these savings ranging from asset management to global sourcing to heat rate improvements. We're also continuing to standardizing our processes across all functional areas allowing for organization or consolidation. As a result, this year we're combing our Europe and Asia strategic business units, which will drive significant savings.","With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter results, capital allocation and guidance in more detail.","Thomas O'Flynn","Thanks Andr\u00e9s, and good morning. Today, I will review our second quarter results, capital allocation, and guidance. Overall, we had a strong quarter benefiting from higher availability several of our businesses and lower Parent interest expense.","Turning to adjusted EPS on slide 13, second quarter results were $0.25, and $0.08 increase from 2016. Year-to-date, we've achieved 40% of guidance point consistent with our historical pattern.","The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by higher margins, as availability improved at several of businesses primarily an MCAC in Argentina. They also benefited from paying down approximately 500 million of Parent debt since a year ago.","Now to slide 14 and our adjusted PTC and consolidated free cash flow. We earned $243 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, an increase of $83 million largely driven by higher margins and lower Parent interest. We generated $106 million of consolidated free cash flow, a decrease of $448 million from second quarter of 2016, which was driven by large collections receivables in Europe and Brazil SBUs in 2016.","Now I'll cover SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 15. In the U.S., our results reflect slightly lower margins primarily due to a true-up for deferred fuel cost following the rate case of IPL in 2016, as well as lower regulated ESP rates at DPL.","Adjusted PTC increased marginally largely due to growth in our distributed energy business. Lower consolidated free cash flow also reflects the timing of working capital requirements at DPL.","At Andes, our results reflect higher margins primarily due to higher availability in Argentina where our CTSN plant completed a major plant outage in the second quarter of last year. Although, margins increased adjusted PTC decreased due to lower capitalized interest related to completed construction projects in Chile and lower interest income in Argentina.","In Brazil, our results reflect steady margins with lower cash flow due to the recovery of high purchase power cost in 2016 from prior droughts and our distribution business Eletropaulo. It's worth mentioning on a full-year basis, we continue to expect low hydro conditions in Brazil. But the impact will be much less than prior years due to changes we've made to our hedging strategy.","We now have about 80% contracted in 2017, which leaves us well-positioned to absorb hydro shortfalls. In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect higher margins driven primarily by availability in Dominican Republic, Mexico and Puerto Rico. As you may be aware our offtake in Puerto Rico, PREPA recently filed for bankruptcy which result in a technical default of our non-recourse debt.","AES Puerto Rico continues to provide the lowest cost generation on the island and accordingly is being fully dispatched and paid. We're working constructively with the lenders and continue to monitor the bankruptcy proceedings closely.","In Europe, our results reflect higher capacity margins in United Kingdom. Consolidated free cash flow decreased due to the collection of overdue receivables in 2016 at Maritza in Bulgaria.","Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and slightly high working capital primarily due to the timing of fuel payments at Masinloc in the Philippines.","Now to slide 21, an update on our filing at DP&L in Ohio. As you may know, in March, we reached a settlement agreement with Commission's staff and certain interveners in our EFP case. The agreement includes a distribution modernization writer [ph] totaling $105 million per year over three years with a two-year extension option.","The ultimate goal is to transform DPL into a stable and growing T&D business. To that end, DPL is selling or exiting all of its 2.1 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity by mid-2018 and is exploring strategic options for the remaining 1 gigawatt of gas-fired peaking capacity.","The post-hearing briefing in the EFP case concluded on May 15th and we expect final approval by the Commission this quarter. Ruling consistent with the settlement agreement, we helped DPL continue to reduce leverage and transition to investment grade rating.","Now to slide 22, and our improved credit [ph] profile. This year, we have prepaid $300 million of Parent debt targeting some of our highest coupons bonds resulting in an annualized interest rate as $20 million. This brings our total Parent debt to $4.4 billion, which is a $2.1 billion or about a one-third reduction since 2011. Also in the second quarter, we refinanced an additional $500 million Parent debt, which will reduce our interest expense by $15 million per year.","Through disciplined debt reduction and strong growth in Parent free cash flow, we expect to attain investment grade credit metrics by 2020. We continue to believe this will help us to not only reduce our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility, but also enhance our equity valuation.","Now to our 2017 Parent capital allocation on slide 23, which is in line with our prior disclosure. Sources on the left-hand side reflects $1.5 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes about $625 million of Parent free cash flow.","As we discussed last quarter, in addition to the $300 million we received from the sale of Sul in Brazil, we continue to target $500 million in asset sale proceeds. We expect to announce by the end of the year, however received a proceed may take a bit longer possibly into early 2018. One of the uses on the right-hand side of the slide, include the dividend increase we announced in December will be returning almost $320 million to shareholders this year.","We allocated $340 million to prepay Parent debt, as I just discussed. We've allocated $382 million for our acquisition of sPower and plan to invest $350 million in our subsidiaries, the majority of which is for new projects under construction in late-stage development. After considering these investments in our subs, debt repayment in our current dividend were left with roughly $100 million of discretionary cash in 2017.","Now looking to our capital allocation over the next four years on slide 24. Our portfolio will generate $3.8 billion of discretionary cash due 2020, which was largely driven by Parent free cash flow. This internally generate cash is sufficient to fund our dividend and construction projects. We'll also provide a capital to further create shareholder value through dividend growth, reducing leverage and opportunistic investments in our development pipeline including renewable projects, Andr\u00e9s has discussed.","Finally, at in slide 25, based on our performance year-to-date in foreign currency, in commodity forward curves as of June 30th, we're reaffirming our 2017 guidance and expectation for 8% to 10% average annual growth due 2020 for our metrics. Overall, we remain confident that we can deliver attractive growth to our shareholders in 2020 and beyond.","With that, I'll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Tom.","Before we take your questions, I would like to summarize today's call with the following takeaways. We're encouraged with the performance of our portfolio during the first half of the year. We're exploring all options to address the construction challenges at our Alto Maipo project in Chile. And we are hopeful that we will reach a resolution before your end.","To drive our near-term growth, we are on track to complete our remaining projects under construction and our revenue enhancement and cost reduction initiatives. We have made significant progress towards repositioning our portfolio by adding renewables in natural gas with long term, U.S. dollar denominated contracts.","We have continued to reduce our leverage to improve our credit profile and achieve investment grade metrics. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 8% to 10% annual growth through 2020 in all key metrics including free cash flow earnings and dividend.","Now, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you. Good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Ali.","Ali Agha","Good morning, Andr\u00e9s Gluski and Tom first question, so when we look at the first half results, how does that position you when you look at the range for the year, now that half the year is over, can you give us some more color on how you're trending within that range?","Thomas O'Flynn","Well, it's a - most of that is 40% of year-to-date, we tend to be somewhat seasonal towards the second half, so it puts us right within the range and right within our guidance.","Ali Agha","Okay. And Andr\u00e9s on the - on Alto Maipo, as you mentioned, expect to have a resolution before year-end, assuming you too decide to walk away from the project and take the write-off as supposed to the risk of further construction delays et cetera, would that in any way impair and Gener ability to dividend cash up to the Parent, if there is a write-off et cetera?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, we expect to receive the cash from Gener, I mean there may be somewhat of a difference in terms of dividends versus return of capital. But otherwise, it will not affect our expected cash from Gener. In the short-term it actually provides more cash at Gener, and Gener is doing very well from a cash basis.","Ali Agha","And so, I know that the rating agencies had put them on some credit watch et cetera, any rating downgrade et cetera would not impair their ability to dividend cash up.","Thomas O'Flynn","Well, it's important that and Gener maintain its investment grade rating. And Gener I would expect AES Gener to take all steps to maintain its investment grade rating.","Ali Agha","Okay. And final question, your message is pretty clear, you're executing, you're hitting what the track guidance that you laid out for us. Yet you stock stays caught up in this very narrow range doesn't seem to be reacting to the results that you are posting.","Does that cause you to step back and take a more holistic or a bigger picture view on what it will take to get your stock up and especially when you look at that capital allocation pie chart that you've showed us over the next few years. Does that cause you to rethink how you'd like to reinvest some of that unspoken for cash or some other steps that you think are required given that your stock does not seem to be reflecting the results you're posting?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","It's a great question, Ali. Periodically since I became CEO, five years ago, we have used third parties to look at our strategy and look at our execution talking about banks, I am talking about consultants. To look at our strategy, and to look at our execution and see if there is any that we can increase value creation for our shareholders.","So, we've continue to do that to have a really so give them card plants and say, okay, this is our portfolio, this is our plan, what we can do better?","Now based on that, what we are seeing, if we execute on our plan, we expect our stock to react. And so, we really have to have a development of several quarters of hitting our numbers. Here is hitting our numbers and execute on these projects. Then execute on our cost savings. And if we do that, we think that our stock will react.","Now, obviously, we are 70% filled outside of the U.S. 50% approximately in Latin America. And the last five years have - you've seen a secular decline in commodity prices and in Latin America. Now, we are starting to see turnaround in some other countries. I mean Brazil has actually stopped declining in terms of GDP. It's flat and starting to turn up. Argentina is doing much better. And certainly, Argentina is one case where we've seen the country to do significantly better.","So, our forecast is based on a continuation of the current situation, but I think if you start seeing a turnaround from some of these countries that would-be upside.","Ali Agha","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","Thank you. I have a question about - but first okay. So, you just acquire [indiscernible] can you tell us how it adds to the 8% to 10% earnings growth? And basically, just give us a sense of what are the biggest drivers behind the earnings growth for the 2020?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure, Angie. I think for sPower as you know has a pipeline of around 10 gigawatts. But as you saw in what we were forecasting we have about less than 2 gigawatts over the next three years of growth coming from renewables and a good part of that is sPower.","So, sPower has a number of facilities currently under PPA to be built. And it also is an exclusive negotiation for quite a lot of gigawatts well. So, that's one way we see it. We also see that it gives us a scale to be more competitive on renewables especially solar around the world.","So, giving us to that scale to buy panels and balance of plan as cheaply as possible, improve our designs and then the same thing with wind. So, if you see what we've done lately, I mean we have quite a lot of renewable not only in the states, we have it on our platform whether it'd be Jaite [ph]. We have another project in Mexico which are both over 300 megawatts.","And I would say that outside of the U.S., the returns tend to be higher, especially when we use our platform especially when we are financing it locally. So, all these platforms expansions we are looking at mid to higher-teens returns and we're looking at sort of low double-digits in the states for return. So, this is how they contribute them. I don't know if Tom, you'd like to add something.","Thomas O'Flynn","No, I think that covers at it mean. Angie, we showed some of the growth on page nine, I think those are relatively conservative because our focus on signed PPA and things with exclusive negotiations obviously we - the teams are focusing on bigger things, I think it's consistent from sPower perspective, it's consistent of what we said, we expect them to do about 500 megawatts a year of new projects probably three to four to start and six to seven of as you look over four to five-year period.","So, slide nine would be generally consistent. And then also be generally consistent with our growth is driven by new projects, by continued cost management and few capital allocation and investments and things like sPower.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. With the assets that have already PPAs have you procured or has the company procured panels so that you don't have an issue with any pair of changes for imported panels?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, we have procured the panels, we have secured the panels for everything we have under PPA. Now of course you know in terms of the projects and advanced negotiation, we will match up the purchase of the panels with having the contract, we don't want to be long or short panels.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. And for Alto Maipo, you keep showing that you've largely paid your equity investment into the project, but is this a signal that there is basically no scenario under which you're going to increase the equity commitment to the projects?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Well, this really would be a decision at AES Gener and it would be strictly again AES Gener not an AES contribution. But it would have to be part of a complete solution, which includes greater financial flexibility and a modification of the contracts we have where the contractors are say stick to the milestones and stick to the progress that we expect from them. So, these are the two changes that we have to occur.","Now having said this, if Alto Maipo is completed, will give AES Gener 750 megawatts of hydro next is country's load in Santiago and it's an asset that will last 100 years so we're evaluating the possibilities and we're trying to get everybody lined up and so as I said, we will have ourselves and AES Gener have indicated we will have a lot of discipline when it comes to any additional money, in addition to what's been committed.","Angie Storozynski","Okay. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thank you, Angie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi. Good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Morning, Steve.","Stephen Byrd","Just two quick follow-ups on Alto Maipo briefly, just so I understand. If you were able to have construction contractors in place that we're able to firmly commit to the existing timeline etcetera with this higher budget is that sufficient to make an economic to complete the project or do you need essentially further concessions of some sort to make the project worthwhile complete?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","If I understand your question correctly if the contractors comply with the restructuring that we did earlier this year, that would be sufficient to me that we have sufficient funds to meet that plus have some contingency. So, yes that would adequate. What concerned us is we had to terminate one contractor it's the smaller of the two contractors but we really have to have a performance that's in line with what they had committed to.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. Andr\u00e9s, so essentially either the current contractor could assume that obligation or you could bring in another party but you would need that commitment in order to able to move forward.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That's correct. We have to have modification construction contracts to make sure that they're delivering and don't miss the milestones in the targets.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, understood. Just shifting to the U.S. in terms of the remaining generation assets to be disposed of, is there a potential for significant tax loss that could be beneficial in the event of a disposition whether it's pull for cash or some of the assets are simply shutdown?","Thomas O'Flynn","Stephen, its Tom. There may be, remember we already have a large NOL, so anything that we had would really add to that NOL, but our NOL is over $3.5 billion at year end so\u2026","Stephen Byrd","Just be additive to that yes\u2026","Thomas O'Flynn","Yeah, I don't know the details of the closure of the coal plants. But it would be longer term NOL benefit.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, understood. And then just lastly on your storage joint venture very interesting development, assuming the business is successful on a joint venture basis. How generally would that impact your financials overtime?","Would there be like I'm thinking about working capital contributions profits from project sales versus ongoing contracts in which you receive revenues? How, just sort a high level with this potentially impact your bottom-line knowing that it's early day still?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure. As I said, this is a market that is expected to grow almost by a factor of 10 in over five years. So, obviously it's going to grow very quickly and that's going to require funds at the JV. So, we expect - we don't expect as significant contributions from the JV for two years, it might be a modest drag, very slight.","And then afterwards, we would expect it to use that funds to continue to grow slightly. So, it'd be some time before we get cash back from the JV, if it successful and growing very quickly. But we would expect to use as non-consolidated subsidiary to have the earnings from that two years of going forward.","So, this is I think very promising. It certainly a unique JV, because nobody has our experience, 19-year platform which has been used for 10 years and Siemens is globally reach. And one thing to understand is Siemens has also contributing their energy storage solution which consist storage, which is more sort of C&I, just smaller. So, the two are complementary, so this will allow us to have the full gambit.","So basically, what we have in our guidance right now is very conservative, so JV does very well, there will be upside. But I would expect it to take two years to really start materializing, but we think this is very promising. Now, we will also have energy storage of our own on our platform and we will be a client affluent for our own projects. For example, such as Southland.","Stephen Byrd","Understood. And Andr\u00e9s, just in terms of the types of margin you would get from this joint venture, could it be servicing margin what more likely to be essentially product sales margins? What kind of margin generally should we expect there?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","It will be a combination of both. So, obviously Siemens has a lot of experience on this. So, there will be a margin on the sale and then there will be a margin on services. And obviously you try to have a balanced. Again, there is a lot of interesting possibilities here, as you know there is Siemens has a financing hour to make this. So, we'll have to see how the market develops and what are the different options. So, we have a great team I think there is tremendous energies between the two and stay tune.","Stephen Byrd","Excellent. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research. Please go ahead.","Lasan Johong","Thank you. So, going back Alto Maipo very quickly I have a couple of follow-up questions. Does the new investment increase AES ownership we have in Jan, and with all 40% now it 62% really grown up until if you make an additional investment?","Thomas O'Flynn","Let see, we owned 67% of AES Gener. AES Gener to cover for a nominal's amount of the 40% that our share our partner had - our local partner had in Alto Maipo. So, now we have about a 93% share. So, it will depend on how the negotiations go, because the contract has 7%. So, as part of the solution, they could take a greater stake. So, I don't see anything meaningful happening to the sort of 62% like we one or two up but or down. So, we'll have to see but now it's not going to go up materially.","Lasan Johong","And if any [indiscernible] I know just start beside to answer more important continue to invest, you need to modify your long-term interim contract, offtake contract?","Thomas O'Flynn","No.","Lasan Johong","Okay. So, how do you preserve your ROE or ROI results?","Thomas O'Flynn","I'm sorry, the question is how do we preserve the ROE on Alto Maipo or overall on our...","Lasan Johong","Alto Maipo is you are investing more money, but you're not...","Thomas O'Flynn","That's fair. Obviously, Alto Maipo will not fulfill ROE expectations. We have been reducing them overtime. The decision what we made on the basis of marginal returns from marginal investments.","Lasan Johong","Okay. Also, just on Fluence, is one of the objective to research of funding and research and energy storage or Fluence experimentation.","Thomas O'Flynn","Well, Fluence is a commercial operation. We've always seen our energy storage is a business and a need to make profit for it. Now, Fluence will continue to upgrade the design, look at ways stripping out the cause, looking at new applications. I mean, one of the things we've only - I'd say there's a lot more applications for energy storage that have been deployed to date. So those are all those things that Fluence will do. So, there will be some design and some creations of innovation at Fluence. But it's not just a sort of or indeed for its own sake. It's exceptionally commercial orientation.","Lasan Johong","Yeah. I'm just wondering if you'll going to be R&D component. One last question from long-term perspective, 8% to 10% growth there are some utility in U.S. that are doing that kind of rate risk? What can AES do to boost that 8% to 10% growth rate going forward.","Thomas O'Flynn","I think again we're paying a 4% dividend and we're looking at 8% to 10% growth, that puts sort of 12% to 14% range. And we think we have upside from things like a recovery in the secular sort of cycle that we've seen in the countries - some of the countries where we operate and there have always been cycles in the last five years it's basically even in one direction, it's been down.","Lasan Johong","Yeah.","Thomas O'Flynn","The growth has been down in all these countries. We have things like Fluence, which would be upside. And the other thing to mention, if you compare us to U.S utilities is that I say two things, one, we're trading at a much lower PE, so as we improve our credit we would expect to have an uptick on our TE, same thing, if we deliver on our results.","And the other thing, is we are in markets which are growing. Because it's in the states, we're doing what everybody is doing in terms of switching to gas, doing renewables. We have the upside of seeing with sPower and how can we incorporate more energy storage on to that base, but it's very - it's nice to be in countries where demand is growing anywhere from 5% to 10%.","So again, we tend to be conservative on our estimates. We're using forward curves. And at some point, we think the cycles beginning to turn around.","Lasan Johong","Excellent. Thanks very much.","Thomas O'Flynn","Thanks, Lasan.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Chris Turnure with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Turnure","Good morning. You've touched on this a little bit, and definitely touched on in the press release and the announcement of Alto Maipo from a couple of weeks ago. But how can we think about the kind of exact contribution that's in your guidance right now through 2020 from that project?","You have a substantial amount of growth over the next couple of year according my calculations that project could have released initially been a major contributor to that growth rate.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","On the numbers we're providing, it's absolutely minimal and significant through 2020.","Chris Turnure","Okay. So, when you say minimal, should we think about that as you pushing out an online date passed 2020 or into the middle of 2020 or just substantially lowering the returns from a fully operational project?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes. I would say when we looked at it put our guidance in February through 2020 we had dialed it back considerably. It had some modest contributions quite modest in 2019 and 2020. So, within our guidance range here, it was very modest. Obviously, if we extend it goes forward, it could have more meaningful, but as Andr\u00e9s said. It's certainly much lower ROE, IRRs than we initially envisioned three years ago, when we went with the project.","Chris Turnure","Okay. That's great to hear. And then, also obviously your long-term guidance is still marked off of I think December 31st ForEx curves and things have gone very much in your favor since that time and you've announced and closed the sPower acquisition should we think about there being kind of other tailwinds to that growth rates versus your original expectations as well totally separate from Alto Maipo?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","So, there is various puts and takes our reaffirmation guidance today is based on four curves as of June 30th. We've done a lot of effort to reduce some of the evolve in foreign currencies we're now 80% U.S. dollar so to the extent there's any uplift that less than it has been also have hedges in place for on a rolling one to three-year basis depending upon where we are so net-net we're looking at forward curves as of June 30th.","Chris Turnure","Okay. And then lastly, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that there's still $500 million placeholder of asset of sales this year it might spill in terms of closure into early next year, can you kind of remind us of maybe strategically where you are in the process of divesting non-strategic assets, how far or long you are there and I don't know if the decision to, I guess merge the Asia and European business units kind of speaks to that directional a little bit as well?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure. This is Andr\u00e9s. As we said, we'll continue to sell assets and churn that capital. As you know this year we're likely to leave Kazakhstan being one less country. We have a number of sales going on some are for the whole asset and some are partial sell downs. So, we will let you know when these occur, we don't like to let them know ahead of time because we can have operations impacts.","Thinking about our portfolio what we've always said is that we've gone from 30 countries. We'll be down to 16 by the year end anywhere between 12 and 15 is the right number. I think what's most important for us is that we really have platforms from which we can expand that their true synergies and economies of scale and rather than just a number of countries so we have two adjacent countries and the market's being integrated say something like Central America it's placed where it's in the number of countries than really what does it take to manage these assets well.","So, we really look at those situations where we can add more value, we're more likely to sell down and we don't see expansion opportunities for sell down where we don't see synergies to sell down.","So, as I think we said in the past to give the numbers of $200 million to $300 million ongoing - we'll continue to do this and to perfect our portfolio so as we've said we've been moving much more into dollar denominated contracts. We have a big expansion of gas whether it be Southland, whether it be Eagle Valley, whether Colon in Panama and also obviously renewables and our vision is how do you integrate all of these renewables plus the thermal or conventional energy to provide more attractive and competitive solutions for our clients.","Chris Turnure","Okay, great. Thanks, Andr\u00e9s.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Hey good morning.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, Greg.","Greg Gordon","One just quick question on the slide, so looking at the first quarter slides the second quarter slides your commuted investments in some senior region has gone up from 425 to 700 and that came out of an allocated discretionary cash I'm presuming that that's capital commitments to the renewables business?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yeah, Greg, its Tom. We incorporated Southland.","Greg Gordon","Right that's right.","Thomas O'Flynn","Because we're fairly literal with our commitment so we certainly vision that we enclose the financing is a firm commitment so that's we got...","Greg Gordon","Okay. So, it's Southland it's not\u2026","Thomas O'Flynn","Yeah.","Greg Gordon","Okay. Thank you.","Thomas O'Flynn","Right. And back to the Southland financing is going to be pretty close to COD late 1920.","Greg Gordon","Got you. Okay, great. It's a merger sort of strategic question, do you guys see your renewables development flat form and your sort of renewables footprint for sort of being strategically complete? Or if there is an opportunity to do another big step out into renewables platform in the U.S. would you participate in that sort of looking at that opportunity, because it looks like there is a lot of portfolios for sale. There are - there is at least one growth type format, now that you said that they are looking to sell it partially or completely?","Thomas O'Flynn","What I would say Greg, we've made a big step-up, we have a good growth platform, not to say that we wouldn't opportunistic with some purchase that would add-on, but it would really, I have to provide operating synergies and other things. So, we're position with sufficient scale, especially when you think of us on a global basis. So, we certainly don't have to make any acquisitions at this time.","And of course, we'll continue to be very disciplined, so I think it was very important to establish a beachhead which then allowed us to move to the direction of the market growing, but we certainly don't have to make any sort of follow-up if there were some assets that were adjacent to or provided synergies or gave us a bigger footprint with a particular client, we would look at those.","Greg Gordon","Okay. But there is not just asset for sale, I mean, let's be frank I mean NRG yield is for sale. And they're not just selling assets, they are looking the sale potentially the entire platform including their wind development business, their backlog of undeveloped projects, so theoretically that can really push your business mix into a whole different realm of tilting away from coal I mean in to renewables which is what you're trying to achieve here in first place, so I don't know how much you can comment on whether a strategic deal like that what you can be remotely in the ballpark of opportunity for you?","Thomas O'Flynn","Well, that's certainly is not high on our list. And what I can say we are on a gradual transition, our coal plants are under contract. Those which are merchant which will be the disposing of over the next couple of years, so we're making that big transaction, we have - between those dispositions in the U.S. but we've done in Kazakhstan in some other places, we've already reduced our coal fleet by a quarter in just a last couple of years.","Greg Gordon","Okay, thank you. Take care.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Thank you. One clarification question on the - I guess it's for Tom on the long, I thought on the long-term guidance you don't update to the current June 30, marks, it's goes back to December. So just on the long-term guidance roughly the team currencies are [indiscernible] better commodities maybe worse, but just generally, if you did update would you still be in the rough ballparks of your growth rate?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yeah. I think Steve, bottom-line we would. I mean it's various puts and takes. Currencies have been help some commodity offsets if you said so, I mean we're kind of bundle them altogether and do a check at June 30, 2017.","Steve Fleishman","I see, okay.","Thomas O'Flynn","Yeah.","Steve Fleishman","Got it. Okay and then on the - in terms of the growth rate sPower renewables generally I think you mentioned 400 megawatts to PPAs already for 2020, is that correct?","Thomas O'Flynn","Yes.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah, yeah, that's correct.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And is that, can you give us a breakout of that a little or at least kind of regionally U.S. versus non-U.S.?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That's basically U.S.","Steve Fleishman","That's all U.S.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yeah.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then just in terms of funding the growth of sPower, your plan is to basically would be able to fund that through internal year equity investment through internal cash?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Okay you don't - you're not looking to find other funding vehicles for that? No. Okay. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","To the - sorry. Keep in mind about 80% of the capital is funded through non-recourse debt and equity, it would expect to fund but to the extent there is other sources of funding that could hands returns we'll certainly keep our eyes open.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","Good morning. Alto Maipo, Andr\u00e9s is that still a tunneling issue.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, Alto Maipo, yes, we've done about 40% of the tunneling new project, if you take everything else civil works is more like at 53%, 54% completed. So, the main issue is the progress rates on the tunnels. Now, since one of the contractors left, we've had actual manufacturer working on the TBM internal boring machine, making better progress than they had. So, the issues really one of our tunneling rates and costs.","Charles Fishman","Okay. And then just a second question, the fact that you're combining Europe and Asia, that sort of sand and signal committed the development pipeline as probably not as strong or you're making that decision cannot go as hard in the development knows countries. Is that a correct assessment on my part or am I reading or do you have anything else stay out at about why you're doing now?","Thomas O'Flynn","Well, I think it's a correct assess we're focusing more on certain markets, suddenly where we have the bigger footprint. So, sort of Eurasia Group, there is certainly some opportunities in northern island where we are looking at things in Vietnam, quite attractive and potentially some add-ons in India.","We're doing our energy, the first grid scale energy storage project in India together with Tata Group. So, those are the three where we have the sort of some development activity going on in other countries we do not have any activity going on.","But this is the result, we were leaving Kazakhstan as we've said and we've gotten out of number of countries as most of the countries that we've gotten out of actually we're in the Eurasia region.","So, we will be making significant synergies. The headquarters will be in Amsterdam, which is better than from the States, you only have sort of six given our time difference with the region and its much closer from flights.","Charles Fishman","Okay, that's all I had. Thank you.","Thomas O'Flynn","Thanks, Charles.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Sir, you may begin.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Kelly. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me to this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Mary Wood, our Interim Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Thanks, Ahmed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased to announce that Tom O'Flynn will be joining us as our new CFO in September. Tom is a great addition to our management team and brings a strong combination of financial skills, senior corporate experience and extensive knowledge of the energy and infrastructure sectors. I'm looking forward to working with Tom to execute on our plans to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. I would also like to take a moment to thank Mary Wood for doing a great job as Interim CFO over the past 90 days. Once Tom is on board, Mary will resume her prior position in the finance organization as our Controller.","Now as you might have seen in our press release, we earned $0.18 of adjusted EPS for the second quarter. And although this is below last year's level, our result, year-to-date, of $0.55 are in line with our commitment to our full year guidance. Mary will walk you through the specific drivers later in this call.","Turning to Slide 3. I will provide you with an update on the strategic plan that we laid out late last year to unlock shareholder value. I will then discuss some of the key macro trends affecting the portfolio, as well as recent developments at our more significant businesses. And following Mary's review of our financial results, I will discuss our capital allocation planned for the remainder of the year.","Moving to Slide 4. And just as a reminder, our 3 strategic objectives for unlocking shareholder value are: one, optimizing capital allocation; two, growing the profitability of the existing portfolio; and three, narrowing our geographic and business focus by selling nonstrategic assets. We feel we're making good progress on executing on the strategic plans we laid out. Regarding the narrowing of our geographic focus, we have raised $800 million through asset sales, exited several non-core markets and invested most of these proceeds to strengthen our balance sheet. At the same time, we're improving the profitability of our business by cutting cost, exploiting scale in synergies and making high return investments based on our existing platforms.","Now turning to Slide 5. Let me provide some color on how we're optimizing our capital allocation and considering all uses of discretionary tax, including delevering, share repurchases, growth project and increases in our dividend to improve our total shareholder return. Over the last 9 months, we have made early repayment on approximately $500 million of debt between repaying the corporate revolver and paying down the expensive debt at our Brasiliana subsidiary in Brazil. With respect to share repurchases, since our last call, we have bought back more than 20 million shares for a total investment of $252 million. This brings our cumulative share repurchases since September to 29 million shares or about 4% of those outstanding. Our total investment in our stock since September is more than $341 million, implying an average purchase price of $11.57 per share. Additionally, last week, the board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.04 per share, our first cash dividend payment in almost 20 years. We expect to grow the dividend over time in accordance with the performance of the company and market conditions. The dividend is and will remain an integral part of our total value proposition.","Now please turn to Slide 6. And let's discuss our actions to improve our profitability. We've committed to achieving $50 million of cost savings at the parent level in 2012 and a total of $100 million in cost savings per year by the end of 2013. For 2012, we expect to exceed our target and are now projecting at least $65 million in savings this year as we've already reduced SG&A by $31 million during the first 6 months.","Moving to Slide 7. Let us review our progress in terms of narrowing our geographic and business focus through the asset sale program. Despite a challenging market, we have closed or signed additional deals, such as our French win and China portfolios for additional proceeds of $176 million. To date, we've closed our ninth asset sale since September for cumulative proceeds to AES of $932 million. Thus far, we've achieved attractive valuations for these assets with an average P\/E multiple of more than 20x 2011 adjusted earnings. In summary, we believe that we're consistently executing on the plan that we laid out last November.","Next, on Slide 8, I'd like to briefly discuss important macroeconomic trends affecting our portfolio. We have seen a weakening of GDP growth in some of our markets, including Brazil, where the current year GDP growth rate is expected to be about 2% versus prior expectations of 4%. This is also reflected in a 19% year-over-year depreciation of the Brazilian real. Demand for electric power at Eletropaulo in Brazil this year is expected to grow only about 1%. Nonetheless, over the medium term, we expect growth in Brazil to recover to closer to 4% level and demand for power to grow in line with GDP. In many of our other markets, we are seeing more robust economic growth. For example, Chile and Colombia's economies are growing at nearly 5%, with power demand increasing at up to 7% on some of the grids. Regarding our key markets in the U.S., Ohio's economy is expected to grow in line with the overall U.S. economy at about 2%, while Indiana is slightly lower at about 1%. This year, power demand is increasing at roughly 1% to 1.5% at our Midwestern utilities and most forecasts expect a slight pickup next year.","Generally speaking, weaker commodity prices have negatively affected our results year-to-date. On the natural gas front, while we have seen a modest supply side correction and a fall in the gas-only rig count, prices remain near the $3 per million BTU range, a result at both of our utilities in the U.S. but much more so at DP&L or positively correlated to U.S. natural gas price. Regarding oil and coal prices, both have weakened over the past quarter. In broad brush strokes, although our portfolio is roughly 1\/3 hydro and renewables, 1\/3 natural gas and 1\/3 coal, our results are positively correlated to oil price directly in those markets where fuel oil or diesel set the marginal price and in others where it is set by natural gas or LNG linked to oil prices. On the other hand, AES' results are negatively correlated to coal prices, and we're starting to see the benefit from recent price declines. Today, we're in a buyer's market, and we are leveraging our aggregated annual spend of nearly $2 billion on solid fuels to lock in attractive prices for the remainder of the year. To summarize, while both currency and commodity prices have rebounded slightly as of late, current forward curves still imply a negative EPS impact of around $0.04 relative to where forward curves were as of March 31. Despite this, we've taken the necessary actions to maintain our adjusted earnings per share forecast within our original guidance range.","Now I would like to give you an update on some of recent developments at our more prominent businesses. Let's start with Eletropaulo on Slide 9. ANEEL, the electricity regulator in Brazil, issued the final ruling on Eletropaulo's tariff reset on July 2. The final tariff reset represented a larger decline than the April preliminary proposal and is thus more negative than we had expected. The variance in the final ruling compared to the April proposal was mainly attributable to the change in the benchmark used to determine the level of non-technical energy losses included in the tariff. It is important to mention that we have a positive track record of improving Eletropaulo's operation through reduced energy losses, cost management and revenue enhancement. Since 2010, AES Brazil has implemented the creating value program, which has contributed approximately BRL 325 million or about $160 million to the bottom line through greater productivity and efficiency. Although we are disappointed with the regulatory outcome at Eletropaulo, I would like to point out that our 2 other Brazilian businesses, Tiet\u00ea and Sul, are performing in line with expectations. These 2 businesses represent more than 80% of our earnings from Brazil as we only own 16% of Eletropaulo.","Now turning to Slide 10. I'd like to give you an update on DP&L. The business continues to perform this year in line with our expectations. In terms of customer switching, at the end of June, 56% of the load had switched to competitive providers, up 3% from the end of March. I would like to highlight that DPLER, our retail arm, captured more than 78% of the switched load through the second quarter. As you know, DP&L's current rate plan is set to expire on December 31, 2012. In March, DP&L filed for approval of its next standard service offering in the form of a market rate offer, or MRO, to determine its tariff for 2013 and beyond. At this point, we're in the midst of settlement discussion. The process is constructive but complex given the number of interveners and the diversity of positions. Combined with continued low natural gas prices, some of the potential regulatory outcome that have been proposed by various interveners could result in lower medium-term earnings and cash flows from this business. We continue to work towards an outcome that is fair and reasonable for all stakeholders, and we remain hopeful that we will have a resolution in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. Overall contributions from this business will depend heavily on the final outcome of the MRO.","In the meantime, we're positioning this business for our success in the competitive marketplace by expanding our retail capabilities and enhancing the efficiency of our North American portfolio. DP&L's retail power marketing business, DPLER and MC Squared, are rapidly expanding in markets beyond DP&L's service territory. We are now serving more than 140,000 customers outside of our service area in Dayton, representing annual usage of about 2.5 million megawatt hours. This growth more than offsets 70,000 customers and 2.1 million megawatt hours that have switched to unaffiliated third parties on DP&L's system. Overall, for 2012, we're projecting that DP&L's retail business will serve approximately 200,000 customers, with combined annual retail sales of 8 million megawatt hours. In terms of reducing cost, AES is on track to achieve nearly $10 million in synergy savings across its North American portfolio businesses this year, and we are aggressively pursuing additional opportunities.","Moving to Slide 11. We're seeing positive momentum at some of our other businesses in the portfolio. For example, in the Philippines, our Masinloc plant achieved record performance in May and June. We have seen similar trends at our Kilroot plant in Northern Ireland, where we have benefited from lower coal prices.","Overall, while the last -- while in the last quarter we faced headwinds at some of our businesses, given the results of our portfolio, year-to-date, we are confident that we can deliver on our adjusted EPS and proportional cash flow guidance for 2012, which, as you know, represents a roughly 20% increase over 2011. Looking beyond 2012, as I discussed on our last call, we faced some challenges in 2013, including low capacity and natural gas prices at DP&L. In 2014 and '15, we see favorable trends, including improved capacity prices in PJM, greater demand growth in key markets such as Brazil, Chile and Colombia, improved earnings from our wind portfolio, contributions from our current construction projects and value creation through our capital allocation decisions.","Over the medium term, we remain optimistic about our earnings trajectory and business prospects. The new capital allocation strategy has improved returns on new projects by focusing on utilizing trapped cash and local leverage capacity and expanding on existing platform. We're focusing on those platform expansion projects that require little equity from AES, have shorter lead times and make the greatest contribution to the bottom line. Some near-term examples of these types of projects include Tunhita [ph], a 20-megawatt small hydro facility related to our 1,000-megawatt Chivor hydro plant in Colombia, and the 52 megawatts of lithium ion battery facilities colocated with the Angamos and Deepwater plants. Another potential project is the closing of the open cycle at the Los Mina plant and making greater use of our Andres regassification facility in the Dominican Republic. All of these projects could be constructed relatively quickly, require less equity from AES and would generate earnings faster than greenfield construction.","As far as 2013 is concerned, we will issue guidance no later than the fourth quarter earnings call.","Now Mary will review the drivers of our quarterly results and our 2012 guidance in more detail. Mary?","Mary E. Wood","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. This morning, beginning on Slide 12, I will cover the following topics: first, our second quarter results and key drivers of proportional gross margin, adjusted earnings per share, cash flow from operations and free cash flow; second, parent liquidity; and finally, our 2012 guidance.","As Andres mentioned, we reported $0.18 of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter and $0.55 for the first half of 2012. With our first half results, we are still in line with our internal expectations for the full year. Later in my remarks, I will walk through what we see as the key drivers of adjusted EPS for the second half of this year and why we believe that full year results will still be in line with our guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 although at the lower end.","Before covering the results in more detail, I would like to provide some perspective on the year-over-year decline in adjusted EPS we experienced this quarter. First, during the second quarter of 2011, Gener in Chile had a strong quarter due to significant spot sales at favorable prices. We did not expect that opportunity to reoccur in 2012 so we projected lower results from this business in the second quarter of this year. Gener also had some planned and unplanned outages at its coal-fired facilities during the second quarter of this year. The lower volume also contributed to the year-over-year trend. All affected plants are back on line and performing in line with our expectation. Second, our quarterly results include an additional and final adjustment to the new tariff for Eletropaulo recently approved by the regulator, which was a tougher outcome than anticipated and required a catch-up accrual. These factors affecting 2 of our more significant businesses explain much of the year-over-year decline. These headwinds were partially offset by contributions from our new businesses, which are expected to continue to make significant year-over-year contributions in the second half of 2012.","Now turning to Slide 13. Our proportional gross margin decreased by $56 million compared to the second quarter of 2011. Gener recorded a reduction of $60 million, approximately half due to lower spot sales and half due to lower plant availability. The proportional gross margin impact of the Eletropaulo tariff reset was $35 million for the quarter, including a catch-up accrual of $12 million. This represents the final adjustment for the tariff decision as we have been accruing for the outcome since the third quarter of 2011. In addition, unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates had an impact of $20 million. These trends were partially offset by the contributions of new businesses in the United States, Bulgaria and Latin America.","Turning to adjusted earnings per share on Slide 14. Second quarter results decreased by $0.11 to $0.18. Gener in Chile accounted for $0.07 of the decline. Eletropaolo, primarily due to the final tariff reset, represented $0.04 of the reduction. Offsetting these declines, new businesses contributed $0.04 during the quarter. A reduction in SG&A also added $0.02 for the quarter. Foreign exchange headwinds reduced adjusted EPS by $0.02 for the quarter, primarily driven by the Brazilian real, which has depreciated by 19%. Together, the operating drivers accounted for $0.07 of the decline. In terms of non-operating drivers, the quarterly effective tax rate was higher than the rate from a year earlier due in part to a change in the book income mix, which resulted in a $0.03 reduction year-over-year. We expect a reduction in the effective tax rate on a full year basis.","Now turning to cash flow on Slide 15. On a proportional basis, our free cash flow has increased 44% compared to the second quarter of 2011. This was driven by contributions from new businesses and a higher cash flow from Latin American generation due to improved working capital, partially offset by a decline at Eletropaulo adjusted for a 16% ownership stake.","Now I will review our parent liquidity as of the end of June on Slide 16. During the quarter, we benefited from $677 million of inflows from our asset sales and cash from our subsidiaries. During the quarter, we invested $230 million in share repurchases. After $323 million of corporate interest, overhead and investment, we ended the second quarter with more than $1 billion of parent liquidity, up from $911 million at the end of the first quarter. We are pleased with our operating performance that provides us ample liquidity to increase value for our shareholders.","Turning to Slide 17. I'd like to discuss our outlook for the remainder of the year. Although we have faced significant headwinds, we expect to offset most of these with new businesses, operational improvement, cost reductions and capital allocation initiatives that we have been discussing for the last few quarters. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2012 adjusted EPS and proportional free cash flow guidance although we now expect to come in at the lower end of the range. Next, I will review the specific drivers of our second half 2012 performance and how we expect to achieve our adjusted EPS target, through year-over-year changes in our businesses, as well as proactive steps that we have taken to improve our earnings.","Turning to Slide 18. Our pro forma adjusted EPS was $0.56 in the second half of 2011, excluding the pre-closing interest cost on the $2 billion of parent debt that we issued to fund the acquisition of DP&L. We believe that the performance of our businesses will be largely consistent with the second half of 2011. Beyond this, we expect to generate an additional $0.11 to $0.15 of earnings, with approximately 70% or $0.09 of this expected increase, driven by contributions from new businesses. As a reminder, Maritza, Changuinola and Angamos achieved full commercial operations late in the second half of 2011 and DP&L was acquired in late November. In addition, our key initiatives, such as cost cutting, operational improvements and capital allocation, are expected to contribute roughly $0.06. These gains are partially offset by year-over-year commodity and foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $0.03 to $0.04. The $0.11 to $0.15 of improvement that we are targeting in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2011 should put us in the lower end of our adjusted EPS guidance range of $1.22 to $1.30 for the year. Although we expect both the third and fourth quarters of 2012 to record gains year-over-year, the second half increase is more weighted towards the fourth quarter.","As discussed on our last call, our guidance assumes the extension of the controlled foreign corporation, or CFC, look-through provision, originally enacted under TIPRA. As in prior years, we expect Congress will retroactively extend this tax legislation later this year. Based on actions taken last Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee, which voted for a 2-year extension, we continue to expect that this will occur. If the CFC look-through rule is not extended before year end, we estimate an impact of $0.02 to $0.03 this year. Recall that this would be a noncash impact as we have an outstanding net operating loss balance of approximately $2.1 billion. Overall, we continue to project the tax rate in the low 30% range, generally in line with the rate we recorded in 2011.","Turning to our cash flow guidance on Slide 19. As we discussed on our last call, we expect our full year results to achieve the lower end of our range on proportional free cash flow primarily as the result of working capital changes and assets sold this year. We are also now guiding to the lower end of our range on subsidiary distributions as we may elect to retain some operating cash at our key platform businesses, such as Gener, for tax-efficient investment purposes. In summary, we are pulling all the levers available to us to meet our guidance despite the headwinds that we experienced in the last quarter.","Andres will now address our plans for capital allocation for the second half of 2012.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Thank you, Mary. Now moving to Slide 20, I would like to discuss our plans for capital allocation for the balance of 2012. This year, we expect to generate $1.6 billion of discretionary cash. Year-to-date, we've already allocated 61% to strengthening our balance sheet. We have used another $145 million or 9% towards our joint venture in Turkey and wind projects in the U.K. and Poland to realize the value of recent pipeline acquisitions. We expect to invest an additional $132 million in other growth opportunities during the second half of the year. This leaves us with roughly $350 million of discretionary cash that we have not yet allocated. We will continue to update you on our capital allocation plan as we receive the cash later this year.","Turning to Slide 21. In terms of future growth, our construction program remains on schedule. Construction work at our 270-megawatt Campiche project in Chile is progressing well, and it's expected to commence operations in early 2013. The Kribi project, a 216-megawatt power plant in Cameroon, is also expected to come online in 2013. Additionally, the 1,200-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam is scheduled for commercial operations in 2015, and civil and construction works are underway at the site. As a reminder, we have already made the necessary equity contributions and have committed nonrecourse debt financing for all of these construction projects.","In terms of future value creation, we will continue to focus on those markets and platforms where we have a significant presence and a compelling competitive advantage. To that end, we're making progress on our advanced development pipelines in Chile, Colombia and the U.S. In Chile, we have the Cochrane project, a 532-megawatt expansion adjacent to our newly commissioned and successful Angamos plant. We're also progressing on Alto Maipo, a 531-megawatt run of the river hydro near Santiago that builds upon our existing Alpalpal [ph] facility. In the U.S., we will grow our platform at Indianapolis Power & Light with investments in environmental controls at some of our coal-fired generation units that will earn regulated returns. Outside of the 3 biggest markets, we also see growth opportunities in the Philippines and India. We are working on Masinloc 2, a brownfield expansion of our very successful Masinloc plant in the Philippines. In India, we're pursuing an expansion of our OPGC facility and expect to be able to fund a substantial portion of our equity with local liquidity. For all development projects, we will utilize the most capital-efficient funding sources, including local cash generation and leverage capacity wherever possible to reduce the required AES equity contribution and improve AES' capital efficiency.","In closing, we believe that the successful execution of our strategy, consisting of disciplined capital allocation, platform expansions, cost cutting and efficiency initiatives, will allow us to create more value for our shareholders. With respect to the second half of 2012, we expect the contributions from our new plants and businesses, which came online late last year, plus better plant availability in Chile, will deliver strong growth this year. In summary, we expect to meet our commitment and achieve our adjusted EPS and proportional free cash flow guidance for 2012.","I look forward to visiting many of you with our newly appointed CFO, Tom O'Flynn, in the near future. Operator, we will now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jon Cohen.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the global credit environment and whether or not it's becoming more difficult to finance some of your growth and also refinance some of the amortizations of the project that's coming due.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Yes. I think that in general, we could say that we see tighter financial conditions especially in the project finance area. In our case, it can be, in some markets, an advantage, where we have strong platforms that we can get nonrecourse financing from those platforms. We also have very strong relations with multilaterals, such as the IFC and with bilateral credit agency. So what we're doing now is changing from our project financing model to include more bilateral, multilateral financing and making greater use of the platforms. But really, this is playing to our strength and playing to our strong local presence and our strong relationship with these entities.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But is the -- so the decision to retain more cash at certain of these subsidiaries, is that in any way related to what you're seeing in the credit markets?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","No, no. What -- in the sense that as the subs -- most of our -- a lot of these big subs are investment grade, we see that we don't have any issues with the refinancing. It's basically a decision given that if we have sufficient liquidity at corp, it's much more efficient from a tax perspective not to bring money out of the country, pay a tax and put money back in. So it's basically given that they have very attractive investment opportunities, we're saying that we'd leave some cash in them. In other cases, in some of the other ones, we do have trapped cash, for example, in India, where we have not been able to dividend the money out. So between us and our partner, which is the state government of Orissa, we have about $180 million. So we're going to deploy that in an expansion of the facility. So there is a differentiation.","Jonathan Cohen - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. If the tax extenders package does not get done, is that $0.02 to $0.03 headwind that you've mentioned before enough to sort of knock you out of the bottom end of that guidance range? Or do you have enough cushion in there to account for that?","Mary E. Wood","We -- this is Mary. We have not built the $0.02 into our guidance although about $0.01 of it is already reflected in our first half results. So it's something that we will have to address although we feel very confident that it will get extended.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","So I wanted to first talk about the long-term growth earnings guidance, so 7% to 9% in EPS growth of 2012. Do you -- I mean, I haven't heard you really reiterating that target. And do you think it's still achievable given the macroeconomic backdrop that you're facing?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","What we are committed to is an 8% to 10% total return over the next 3 years. What we have said is there wouldn't be a straight line growth. And what we see is more challenges in '13. We see a lot of big tailwinds helping us in '14 and '15. So we will manage to that 8% to 10% total return, which, of course, includes our dividend. And, of course, we will update you once we have more information, for example, on what's happening in the various markets. But I think given our portfolio and given the diversity of fuels that we have, one of the things we will come back to you, if need be, is after the settlement of the MRO, for example, in DP&L. But we remain committed to that 8% to 10% total return, which is earnings growth plus dividends.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. Secondly, I was a little bit surprised to see share buybacks during the quarter because I thought that you were not planning to have any share buybacks up until the end of the year. And secondly, it seems like you are becoming a little bit more aggressive with your retail strategy in Ohio. It's also something that I didn't think was a focus. Could you comment on both?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Sure. Regarding the share buybacks, we have said that we would look at share buybacks as one of the uses of our cash and if we felt that there was a compelling valuation that, that would compete with new projects. And in the past, we've said that we would ask for an additional approval to have a bigger program. So we've been very much, I think, executing on what we said we would do. Regarding the retail market in the Midwest, perhaps Andy Vesey can comment on it but that's really part of our strategy of building off our platforms in specific markets.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Yes. This is Andy Vesey. In terms of your question on retail, it's one of the 3 levers we have at Dayton Power & Light, and one has always been to defend our current service territory, the customers there, and also go off system to attract customers. The whole theory behind our retail operations is really the placement of our generation at DP&L. It's the most collaterally efficient way to do that. So our strategy in retail is to continue to gain customers so we could play a strong generation. We have to be aggressive because it's a very intense competitive environment, and it's a game that we're going to play in very hard.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ali Agha.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Some little questions, Andres. If I do the math right, based on the share buyback which you have completed so far, I believe there's only about $50 million left in your current authorization. Should we assume that authorization is going to get expanded? Or how should we be thinking about the future buybacks from this level?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","You're right, Ali. There's about $48 million left in the authorization. We intend to use that and, again, depending as we see the -- our cash coming in and we see our growth prospects, we'll again evaluate what is the best use of that cash. And as I've said in the past, that hasn't been a restriction for us. In terms of -- if we need to get more approvals, we will. But we will again have a balanced approach to capital allocation. We have growth projects. We've also delevered to strengthen our balance sheet. And we also have declared a dividend. And we have some growth prospects as well. So it's very much of a balanced approach.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Yes. And going back, Andres, to your 8% to 10% target annual return over the next 3 years or so, you take the earnings component of that -- as you pointed out, DPL will be a challenge certainly in '13. There is not much in terms of new projects coming on until '15 when 1,200 megawatts comes on. So when we look at that trajectory, '12 through '15 -- I want to get a sense from you. To me, buyback and debt reduction seem to be the biggest tool available in your arsenal to achieve that. And I'm just wondering how you think about that and how aggressively should we be thinking about that buyback and debt reduction program for you over the next 3 years.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Well, I think if you look at -- as I mentioned, in '14, '15, we have a number of headwinds besides just the new projects. First, we do have some of the investments we're making in the smaller platform expansions, whether it be at Tunhita [ph], whether it be battery storage, whether it be closing a site. Those things will come on much faster than -- will come online in that period. Also, realize that from an earnings perspective, due to the nature of the tax equity financing at our U.S. wind businesses, we have a substantial pickup in '14 and '15 in terms of earnings. So we do have those things coming on. We also expect more, say, demand growth in some of the markets. We know that there are better capacity prices in PJM, which will also be a big pickup. So it's not that we're just going to be relying on share buyback. I also think that we will have full years of the earning -- of the, sorry, cost savings from the programs that we implemented this year and next in terms of becoming more efficient, in terms of SG&A and other factors of cost. Because we are really looking at cost across our portfolio. So in the $65 million that we're talking about, that's really at the parent level. That does not include, for example, the efficiency initiatives on our North American portfolio. That does not include initiatives in Brazil, in other markets. And so we do have -- in a lot of those areas, we are, I'd say, about halfway through some of those programs and we'll plan to accelerate them in the remainder of this year and next.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And one other thing, on the asset sale program, can you just give us an update on what your current thoughts are relative to your original goal? There was some news, as I'm sure you're aware, about you guys talking to the Chinese about the U.S. wind asset sale that seems to have stalled down now. And so just give us a sense of where you are. And again, from a priority perspective, I know in the past you've talked about trying to monetize your renewables portfolio because you're not getting much in terms of equity value for that. Have you continued to believe that? Or what your current thinking is on the asset sales?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","We remain committed to our initial program. What we had said at the beginning was that we had a universe of about $2 billion that we were looking at. We've executed about almost 50% of it. And I think we've executed it very well because we sold at good prices and good earnings multiple. Going forward, what we will be looking at is those things that really help us have a more focused portfolio, as well as help us reduce the cost of some of the support services that we have. And there are also businesses from which we think we cannot grow. So you're correct in the sense that we had looked at renewables because they were low on earnings as we said that -- but, for example, if we look at U.S. wind today, we do really have that pickup in '14, '15, that's in terms of our earnings. We also do have our solar joint venture with Riverstone, and we'll be looking together ways of monetizing that over the future. So I wouldn't like to get into give specific cases prior to really having something concrete. But we are not really changing from our original position. I think we're executing well, but we're not going to do fire sales. We're going to make sure that we sell the assets in the right form to maximize price. For example, our China asset, there's one case where we did receive bids for it as one package and we realized we could do much better by selling it apart. And the difference is not trivial, it's like $30 million. So we'll continue to execute, but we're going to do it in a prudent fashion.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Last question, I apologize. Given your commodity currency exposure, every quarter, these are moving targets. And so just given the nature of your business, are you going to be comfortable putting guidance out there because there's going to be movements every quarter? Or are there other offsets that you have at your disposal so we're comfortable that when you put a guidance number out, it's going to be achieved regardless of the currency commodity moves that are inevitable every few months?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Yes. I think that's the reason we give a range. And we don't move the range every quarter with the commodity prices. That's one of the drivers of our performance within that range. Now AES is a portfolio. And so generally, we do have offsets. Sometimes, the stars align a little bit so we -- on a quarter basis. That's why we don't quite frankly give quarterly guidance because of that, but we do give yearly guidance. We are very conscious now of the portfolio exposures to the various commodities, and we are taking steps to try to mitigate that over time. So we -- again, those are good questions. That's why we give yearly guidance and we don't give quarterly guidance. And if you actually look at what we're executing on, we are looking at a 20%-plus increase in our adjusted EPS this year, and we've taken a lot of steps. And yes, we've had some headwinds, but that's to be expected.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman.","Charles J. Fishman - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","On Eletropaulo, when you indicate the decision from ANEEL is final, in other words, you cannot appeal that subsequent to their final decision.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Yes. I'd like Andy to answer that one.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Yes. Charles, it's Andy Vesey. There are some things that can be done. And we've actually taken the first step, which is to file for an administrative appeal and review. This is a normal process in Brazil after a tap [ph] -- really, to review things of errors or administrative procedural that may have gone wrong. In our administrative filing, which was filed shortly after the case came out, we basically raised 2 key points: One was the removal from the shielded asset -- excuse me, the shielded rate asset base of 2007 to 2011, of these particular cables. We believe that's a procedural and administrative violation to go in and take things out of a shielded asset -- shielded rate asset base, as well as the loss benchmark that Andres had referred to earlier. In Brazil, this loss benchmark is used for over 40% of the distribution businesses and our analysis shows that statistically, the benchmark was an outlier. And therefore, we're appealing both of those. The process for that is if there were to be a change or any benefit that would come out of that, it probably would be applied at the time of the next half adjustment, which would be July 2013 and be retroactive back to July 2011. We have done this in the past and we have had some movement. But given the size of the issues here, I don't want to raise false expectations but we've already taken that action. Finally, at the end of that, should we still be concerned about the outcome, we always have the right, as any Brazilian company would, to appeal it to the Supreme Court. But in Brazil, that could be a process that could take many, many years.","Operator","And our next question then comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith.","Unknown Analyst","Actually, this is Andrew Gay [ph] stepping in for Julien. Given the increase in the G&A savings for 2012, what are you thinking for 2013? You left the guidance unchanged so might there be further savings there? And then how does that play into your 8% to 10% total return target?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","That's a good question. The savings that we expect from the more focused strategy and the simplification of our portfolio are substantial. And we expect to achieve at least $65 million this year, at least $100 million by the end of next year. Before we would, say, raise the number, we would really like to have more time and more concrete -- part of that will depend on the number of markets, quite frankly, that we exit in terms of going forward, additional markets that we would exit. So to -- in summary, we expect at least $65 million this year, at least $100 million, and this is a run rate going forwards by the end of next year.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then on the Indianapolis RFP, what's the timing on that and how might you get rate recovery on any rate base build and how does that play into any potential future rate cases?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","I will ask Andy to answer that one.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Okay. Andrew, this is Andy Vesey. The process is that we're receiving the interest and the competitive bids. It's my understanding that these will be opened in, I think, mid-September, if not late September. We will also be proposing our own, hopefully, cost-competitive option for that. To the degree that we were to be making capital investments, those most likely would be recovered at our next rate case. And prior to that, we would be getting AFUDC treatment. So if we were to be building this project and I want to say the following is that it's a competitive process at this point in time. So there are many opportunities. One, we could build -- somebody else can build or we could buy the capacity. We could buy the energy. There's many ways to go through this. But if we were to build this project, it most likely would wind up going into rates at our next rate case.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You touched on the Eletropaulo decision and the fact that at 16% ownership, it's a smaller part of the company's earnings. I was wondering if you could touch on it in the context of the Brazil platform and whether you'd consider selling Eletropaulo.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","That's a good question. I mean, we have -- in terms of the large markets where we're present, Brazil is a market with a rapidly growing energy demand and where we had a very substantial footprint. We still have a lot of unlevered capacity -- or leveraged capacity at Tiet\u00ea, which is a contracted 3,000 megawatts of hydro. When we look at what Eletropaulo -- we do own 16%. We did develop the telecoms outside of Eletropaulo. And we also have the footprint in the south in the business of Sul. So our footprint in Brazil is more than just Eletropaulo. We are one of the players there. And we do have the capacity to grow. And we do have now very good relations with BNDES and can finance new projects. We will do projects, of course, that are good projects. So that's -- we have the capacity for growth, but we're making sure that we grow from good projects. Regarding Eletropaulo, we have in effect been in a process of reducing our position there since 2006. We sold down half of our holdings and we took out the telco. So the important thing for us is Eletropaulo is more -- it had, we felt, more regulatory challenges than our other businesses there. And that given -- we have, I think, given what we could do, we've managed it as well as possible. So right now, what we're focusing on is making sure that we make it as profitable a business as possible within the new guidelines. And this is our second major cost efficiency program that we're doing and that's creating value. We had done one prior to that. So I guess, in a nutshell, we still see Brazil as an interesting market. We still have the critical footprint. And we still have the unused leverage at Tiet\u00ea, which are the things that we'd be focusing on. Eletropaulo has been challenging, and we've done everything we can to restore profitability of that business.","Operator","The next caller is Brian Russo.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Could you just clarify the statement you mentioned earlier on the DPL outlook? You said that '13 results would be worse than expected. Is that your original expectations? Or is that based on the MRO and the ongoing settlement? Just hoping to get some more clarification on that.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Basically, what I was referring to is low natural gas prices and low capacity prices, so looking at today's forward curves for gas and looking at what we know for capacity prices in '13, they're low. So those are 2 factors that are affecting DP&L. And we also, of course, know the switching rates that we've experienced to date. So -- what we wanted to be, as transparent as possible regarding what we see for '13 for DP&L just like we do see a much better capacity prices in '14 and '15 at DP&L.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, understood. And then also, you mentioned a few negative headwinds on 2013, including DPL and the commodity sensitivity throughout the portfolio. Could you talk specifically at some of the positive drivers that you see in 2013?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Sure. So the positive drivers that we have is: first, the cost cuts that we've done this year. The second, the projects that have come online fully. So we do have projects, for example Angamos for the -- in Chile, which, for the first half of the year, were contracted at about 65% or now 90% contracted for the second half of the year. So we'll enjoy the benefit of a full year for that. So on '13, we'll have the full benefit of a lot of the construction projects, which were inaugurated at the end of last year. We also see cost cuts coming in and as well as -- we have Campiche, Kribi, some wind projects coming on as well. So there are a number of positive things coming on for 2013, but we also -- we've always pointed it out that '13, given -- we're coming off a base of a 20% growth in 2012. So given that our projects are lumpy, it's not going to be a similar year to 2012. And we have now the issue of what will the MRO filing look like for 2013 in DP&L.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. We should still expect growth in '13 just not quite at the rate we saw in '12 over '11. Is that accurate?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","That's accurate. That's accurate.","Mary E. Wood","In certain markets.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","The aggregate, yes.","Mary E. Wood","Yes.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then one last question, the IPL environmental spend. Can you remind us how much -- how many dollars is to be spent? And then also, when we might expect the next general rate case?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Okay. We don't have an answer to the second one in terms of what we would expect the general rate case. But in terms of the environmental spend, it's around $500 million.","Andrew Martin Vesey","$500 million to $700 million.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Yes. $500 million to $700 million.","Andrew Martin Vesey","And since the -- Brian, this is Andy Vesey -- potentially, we expect probably over 90% of the cost associated with that environmental spend to be covered in the Senate Bill 29. We're going to track a recovery and that expenditure will not drive us any closer to needing to go to a rate case. So it's not -- they're not connected.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Understood. And over what time period is the $500 million to $700 million spent?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Well, we have to be compliant by law by April 2015. We're making an extension. So that project will probably start up in earnest, the environmental control project, in the first quarter of next year, with construction probably starting in the third quarter. And we're dealing with our 5 Petersburg plants and Harding 7, and we're going to match the outage schedule going forward to complete it by 2016.","Operator","And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","[Audio Gap]","waiting for a potential settlement, you keep calling it a procedural MRO? I mean, it's based on the other utilities in Ohio. It feels like it's going to be an ESB [ph]. But if you could comment about why it's taking so long. Is it somewhat linked to the other regulatory procedures pending? And also, you mentioned that power prices in Ohio are positively correlated with natural gas prices. But we have seen a pickup in natural gas prices over the last couple of weeks. And yet, Ohio power prices are actually flat to slightly down. And how that ties into your visibility about profitability of the business?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Okay, let's take one at a time. I think, in terms of the timing, there are 26 interveners in the process and there's a wide range of interveners. So that's one thing that's taking some time. Regarding the second, in terms of power prices in Ohio and the relationship to natural gas, what we're saying is that basically, DP&L's fleet is coal for the most part -- and it's scrap coal for the most part. But nonetheless, it's competing with gas on the margin. So that is one of the things that's affecting the profitability of those plants going forward. It's the same case, for example, due to a much lesser extent at IPL in the sense that we do sell into the wholesale market and we do have coal plants which are competing with coal. I don't know if Andy would like to add some color to some of the questions that were asked.","Andrew Martin Vesey","Yes. The only thing that I would -- to the first part about why it's taking so long. I think you probably all are aware that the procedural schedule was put on hold. Today would have been the date that interveners would have had to file testimony, and August 27 was the last date for the evidentiary hearing, which would have signaled the end of the settlement process. By petition of the parties, the schedule has been suspended because -- the fact is everybody is working very hard to bring this to settlement. So I would probably say that there's still a desire by all parties, all 26 parties, some of whom are our competitors, that a settlement be reached and we are still hopeful, as Andres said in his opening remarks, end of the third quarter or early fourth quarter. And I think the suspension of the settlement -- I mean, of the schedule is a signal that, no, there is no new schedule. And the only time a new schedule will be put into place if the parties basically say they cannot get to a settlement. So we're still on the settlement path. I think on the other side, going into 2013, the forward curves with 2013 on average are about $2.50-plus. That's still low for that business given the range of outcomes. We're hopeful as we get into 2014, with the pickup of capacity prices and continuing strengthening of the gas curves, we'll see this business start to take a much more positive trend as we've said in the past calls.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Okay. And my last question, about Gener. What happened exactly in the second quarter, the lower availability of one of the plants? And should we read into any long-term issues with that business from the results from the second quarter?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","I'd like Ned to answer that one. But basically, no. We don't have any systemic issues there.","Edward C. Hall","Angie, the -- we had outages at several of our large coal plants that have now been repaired. So we were out where we had budgeted to be in service. As a result of taking the units offline, we also moved forward planned outages for later in the year. So we will have the opportunity to make that up in the volume and depending on what prices look like over the rest of the year. So we anticipate recovery.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Chin.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I know you guys have changed around the authorizations for share buybacks earlier this year, but can we just get a tally of how much in your share buyback program you've got left? If I remember right, you had upped the number to $680 million earlier this year. I just want to make sure I understand sort of where we're at and how much is left to go.","Andres Ricardo Gluski","Under our current authorizations right now, we have $48 million. We had $302 million that we mentioned on our prior call. But as I said, the share buyback is part of our capital allocation process. We will look at, if we have compelling valuations, where we allocate the additional $350 million that we have coming in later this year.","Brian Chin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Prior to you doing more share backs, I guess it's safe to assume that we should see another authorization for an uplift provided that, that $48 million isn't all that you want to do, right?","Andres Ricardo Gluski","If you want to answer that, Brian, I don't think we would have to -- we would mention it on the next call if we have authorization, an increase in authorization for buybacks. Thank you all very much for participating in this call.","Ahmed Pasha","Yes, thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, and have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. You may all disconnect at this time."],"607":["The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call November  6, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Ahmed Pasha - VP of IR","Andr\u00e9s Gluski - President and CEO","Gustavo Pimenta - EVP and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - of Bank of America","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Christopher Turnure - JPMorgan","Ali Agha - SunTrust","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Gregg Orrill - UBS","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the AES Corporation's Third Quarter 2019 Financial Review Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Andrea. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2019 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors. Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter 2019 financial review call.","Today, I will walk through the highlights of the quarter and how we are delivering on our commitments and successfully executing on our strategy. Gustavo will then follow with a detailed description of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results.","Our adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.48, which is 37% higher than our results for the same quarter last year. On our prior call, we mentioned that much of our growth would be in the second half of the year, and our strong third quarter results are in line with our expectations.","We are on track to deliver on our 2019 adjusted EPS guidance with the midpoint of $1.34, and our apparent free cash flow target with a midpoint of $725 million, and we are confident in our ability to deliver 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. I am pleased to report that we're making good progress on the strategy we laid out on our previous calls. Allow me to walk you through step-by-step.","First, turning to Slide 4. Let us talk about our progress towards becoming investment-grade. As you may have seen in this morning's press release, we received an investment-grade rating for the first time in the AES' history. I'm very pleased to have achieved this milestone, reflects a multi-year transformation strategy to make our business simpler and more predictable. We not only significantly strengthened our balance sheet, but we have also materially reduced our exposure to risks such as hydrology, foreign currencies, and commodities.","Moving to Slide 5, and our growth in renewables. This quarter, we signed over 900 megawatts of new renewable power purchase agreements, bringing our year-to-date total to 1.9 gigawatts. We are fully confident that we will consistently deliver 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts of new renewable capacity every year.","As of today, our backlog of projects is 6 gigawatts, half of which are under construction and half have signed PPAs. As anticipated, about half of these projects are in the U.S. and half are international. We see ourselves as uniquely positioned in the renewable space to take advantage of synergies and economies of scale, while also benefiting from sufficient geographical diversity.","Looking at this from another perspective on Slide 6, approximately 80% of our 6-gigawatt backlog or 4.8 gigawatts is renewables, split between hydro, solar, wind, and energy storage. We expect the majority of our backlog to be online by the end of 2022. Now on to specific large projects.","On Slide 7, we can see that the 1.3 gigawatt Southland repowering project is virtually complete, and we are currently in the final commissioning stage. We're on track to begin commercial operations in early 2020.","Turning to Slide 8. AES Gener is also making good progress on the Alto Maipo hydroelectric project. The project is 82% complete, including 37 miles of tunnel and both cabins are caverns for the powerhouses. Less than 4 miles of tunneling remain to finish Phase 1 by year-end 2020 at which time the construction of all 531 megawatts of capacity will be completed. In parallel, they are progressing well on the tunneling of Phase 2, which will provide additional water to the project.","Let us now discuss the advances we are making on our LNG strategy and turn to Slide 9. Last month, we received approval from the Government of Vietnam to develop and build a 2.2-gigawatt combined cycle gas turbine project alongside our previously approved 480 tera BTU LNG regasification and storage terminal. This complex will have a 20-year U.S. dollar denominated contract with no commodity exposure. We expect to achieve financial close in 2021 and commercial operations in 2024. We see the expansion of our LNG infrastructure business as complementary to our renewables growth strategy by offering a clean, predictable, and low-cost fuel that provides capacity and flexibility to the system.","We are focusing our LNG business on three markets, the Caribbean, Central America, and Southeast Asia. In all of these markets, there is rapidly growing demand for natural gas to supply new generation and to displace higher cost diesel fuel oil. A good example of how we are benefiting from this growing demand is the Dominican Republic.","As shown on Slide, 10 this quarter we finalized a joint venture with other local generators. As a result of this JV, we will build a second LNG storage tank, expanding our capacity in the Dominican Republic by 80% or an additional 50 tera BTUs.","We have already signed or in advanced negotiations for 30 tera BTU of this additional capacity under long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts. This expansion will require minimal investment from AES, and we expect to break ground in the first quarter of 2020 with completion in late 2022. As we had previously mentioned, our LNG business is easily scalable, which allows us to increase our margin, while requiring relatively little investment from AES.","While we are delivering on our commitments in our guidance periods, we\u2019re also making investments to maintain our leadership in new technologies, which will contribute to our earnings growth in future years. We are currently the global market leader in energy storage and the market leader for cloud-based energy efficiency solutions in the U.S.","Turning to Slide 11. Today we're announcing a strategic alliance with Google to collaborate on innovation across our business line. We will be working together to find new solutions to accelerate the broad adoption of renewables and energy storage and to improve the experience of corporate customers.","AES will collaborate with Google Cloud on energy management and opportunities to develop, own, and operate projects in targeted markets in the U.S. and Latin America that have the potential to help Google meet its clean energy objectives. In addition to providing the potential for additional revenues for AES, this alliance will put both of us on the front line of innovation in the industry allowing us to further reduce costs, optimize operations, and meet changing customer expectations.","On Slide 12, we can see that our strategic investment in the leading U.S. cloud-based digital solutions provider in our sector, Uplight is progressing well. This is a business that is growing rapidly from a base of $100 million in annual revenue. It is cash and margin positive and will provide broad insights into customer behavior and energy efficiency.","Our energy storage business Fluence, continues to be the global market leader, through Fluence our 50-50 joint venture with Siemens. We are able to capture the accelerated growth in demand for this technology.","As you can see on Slide 13 in the first three quarters of 2019 alone, Fluence won contracts for 806 megawatts, compared to the third quarter of 2018 Fluence has tripled its backlog, which now stands at a record high of more than 1 gigawatt with a combined value roughly a 1 billion. Fluence is cash and variable margin positive and continuing to expand its capabilities in order to meet the scale requirements of the business.","Our leading position in energy storage is providing us with a competitive advantage in other aspects of our business. We are seeing that nearly half of all solar projects in the U.S. include a storage component. Based on our scale and more than 10 years of experience in integrating energy storage we are very well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity.","Now I'll turn the call over to Gustavo to discuss our financial results and capital allocation in more detail.","Gustavo Pimenta","Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. Today our overall financial results outlook for 2019 and capital allocation.","Overall, we are very encouraged by our performance to date and remain confident in our ability to deliver on our strategic and financial objectives.","As shown on Slide 15, in the third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.48, primarily reflecting contributions from new businesses including AES Colon in renewables in the U.S. and a lower tax rate. The timing of outages, net of related insurance recovery also had a positive impact on the results in our MCAC region. In the third quarter of 2018 a freak lightning strike caused major damage at our Andr\u00e9s plant in the Dominican Republic forcing it offline with roughly $0.04 impact.","In Panama our Changuinola plant has been on an extended plant outage for most of this year. While we have insurance to offset the large portion of this outages. The timing of recognition is not always evenly distributed throughout the year.","On our second quarter call, we indicated that we expected a recovery in the second half related to this outages. And in fact the majority of this occurred in the third quarter. This was about $0.05, which effectively catches us up for the first half of the year.","As seen on the Slide 16 on a year-to-date basis, the net impact of losses versus insurance recovery is slightly negative at $0.01. Importantly, our Andr\u00e9s facility is fully online in our Changuinola plant is on track to come back online in early 2020.","Turning to Slide 17. Adjusted pretax contribution or PTC was $426 million for the quarter, an increase of $99 million or 30%. I will cover our results in more detail over the next four slides, beginning on Slide 18. In the U.S. and Utilities SBU increased PTC reflects contributions for new renewable projects as well as the resolution of regulated rate cases last year.","These impacts were partially offset by the exit of 360 MW of coal-fired generation at Shady Point. Regarding DPLs DMR extension filing, we remain on track for an expected ruling in the first half of 2020 and continue to feel confident about the merits of our case. In Indiana, IPLs plan to modernize its electric grid which calls for $1.2 billion of T&D investment over seven years we go to hearing on November 14.","Cost would be recovered through an 80% tracker mechanism between rate cases and AES equity investment would be roughly $200 million. If approved, the plan would be a key component of the mid-single digit rate base growth we have discussed in the past. A final ruling in the case is expected by early 2020. At our South America SBU, higher PTC was largely driven by improved margins at Guacolda and lower interest in Chile, as well as higher pricing in Colombia.","I would like to take a moment now to discuss recent developments in Argentina. As you know, Argentina recently elected Alberto Fernandez, as the new President as expected. The policies of the incoming government are yet to be defined but we do not expect a meaningful impact on our outlook.","Especially given the quality of our assets in the material improvement we have achieved in AES portfolio over the last several years. Right now current controls are in place and we will face restrictions incentive dividends out of Argentina. But as a result of our diversified portfolio, you'll be able to mitigate the impact and continue to deliver strong cash flow growth to our shareholders.","Turning back to our quarterly results. As we discussed it earlier higher PTC at our MCC SBU reflects the outages in the Dominican Republic and Panama, net of related insurance recovery as well as the commencement of operations at AES Colon. Finally, in a ratio lower results primarily reflect a one-time transmission charge and lower capacity doing testing and commissioning at OPGC 2.","Now to Slide 22. To summarize our performance in the first three quarters of the year we earned adjusted EPS of $1.02 versus $0.80 - $0.88 last year. In the fourth quarter, we expect the higher quarterly tax rate versus a 24% we saw last year. And an impact from the planet outage at our water run facility in the U.S.","On a full year basis for 2019 we feel very confident and reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $1.30 to $1.38. Further, based on our achievements to date and current outlook, we are also reaffirming our 7% to 9% average annual growth through 2022. Consistent with our prior proxy, we will provide specific guidance for 2020 on our fourth quarter call.","Turning to 2019 Parent Capital allocation on Slide 23. Beginning on the left hand side sources reflect the $1.3 billion of total discretionary cash, which is largely consistent with our last call. Additionally, we are able to take advantage of available debt capacity at one of our subsidiaries spring $200 million in return of capital to the parent. The majority of our discretionary cash continues to come from the roughly $725 million of parent-free cash flow and $350 million of asset sale proceeds.","Asset sales include Northern Ireland and the sPower sell down, both of which have closed, as well as Jordan, which is expected to close by year end. Now to the uses on the right hand side, including the 5% dividend increase we announced in December. We'll be returning $361 million to shareholders. We allocated $450 million to parent debt pay down versus our prior target of $150 million for this year to celebrate our credit improvement in reinforce our commitment to achieve investment grade ratings.","As a result, we expect that to end the year at 3.5 times parent leverage and 22% FFO to that. Comfortably within the investment grade thresholds of four times and 20% respectively. To that end, as Andr\u00e9s mentioned, we are very pleased to see positive actions by the rating agencies included an investment grade rating from Fitch. We are also investing $450 million in our subsidiaries leaving about $50 million of unallocated cash.","Finally, moving to our capital location from 2019 through 2022 beginning on Slide 24. We expect that our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion in discretionary cash, which is again consistent with our last call, plus the additional $200 million in return of capital, I just mentioned, more than 3\/4 of our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent-free cash flow. The remaining $800 million comes from asset sale proceeds about half of which has been announced or closed this year.","Turning to the use of discretionary cash on the Slide 25. Roughly 40% of this cash will be allocated to shareholder dividends. Looking forward, subject to annual review by the board, we expect the dividend to grow 4% to 6% per year, in line with the industry average. We have completed $450 million of parent debt prepayment this year, this is an increase versus our prior target of $300 million.","We are also expecting to use $1.9 billion to invest in our backlog, new project at PPAs, T&D investments at IPL and the partial funding of our Vietnam LNG project. Once completed, all of these projects will contribute to our growth through 2022 and beyond. The remaining $300 million of unallocated cash will be used it in accordance with our capital allocation framework to achieve our financial objectives.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks Gustavo.","Before we open the call to your questions, please allow me to summarize our key points. Our strong third quarter results demonstrate our successful execution, and we remain on track to meet our 2019 guidance and longer-term expectations. We are uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value through strengthening our balance sheet and credit ratings, reducing our carbon intensity, growing our backlog of attractive renewable opportunities, and rapidly expanding our LNG infrastructure business.","We are taking steps to consolidate our position as a technology leader, through technologies such as energy storage and cloud-based energy solutions and most recently, creating a strategic alliance with Google. We believe that our strategy and execution, position us well to offer double digit total returns to our shareholders.","Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So I - perhaps, can you elaborate a little bit in the context of the quarterly earnings here. How much is coming directly from renewables and perhaps to take that a step further, how do you think about the cadence of renewable contributions from here on out, obviously we're starting to see it pick up. How do you think about that rolling into the 4% to 6%, or I know not to get ahead of 20, but how do you think about that even year over year here?","Gustavo Pimenta","Hi Julien, Gustavo. So, in the - particularly in the quarter, most of the growth is in the MCAC region as I mentioned in my remarks. So, the U.S. on the renewable space, probably, we have a $0.01 to $0.02 in the quarter no more than that. And so that's probably what it should be seen on an annual basis, maybe $0.04 to $0.05 growth because we are deploying around $300 million globally, most of that in the U.S. So that's what you will be seeing going forward.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then perhaps more importantly here in the near term, you talked about some new LNG opportunities, a JV effort. Also from what I understand, you have some excess marketing volumes, if you will, in Panama, going into 2020 given the IMO regulations. How do you think about the timing to monetize some of those remaining volumes and also the earnings profile of your latest expansion on LNG, perhaps you can address it more holistically on LNG?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure. This is Andr\u00e9s. So I think we've done exactly what we had been sort of saying that we could do in the Dominican Republic. So basically, we filled up our 70 tera BTU tank there. So, basically it's at full capacity. By signing this joint venture with other local generators, we need additional capacity.","So, we're going to build a second tank with 50 tera BTUs capacity and about 30 tera BTUs is that at - is either agreed to or in the process of that signing agreements for, so that's already quite taking up 60% of the new capacity of the tank.","So, this in the Dominican Republic, I think we have really followed through on what we said was possible. In the case of Panama, we have an 80 tera BTU tank. Right now, that's at most about 30% used and so there is considerable capacity to put other generators on gas, and so Panama does have other natural gas projects.","It also has a lot of diesel plants, not too far from our plant. So really, it's a question of how fast we can connect those. It also has the capacity for re-export just like we have in the Dominican Republic and also for CNG in terms of trucks and local - local industry.","So, I think the point is that in the Dominican Republic we do have capacity now for once we complete this tank for another 20 tera BTUs. And we continue to have about 50 tera BTUs in Panama that are available. So, it's going to be a combination of as we did in the Dominican Republic, local demand, additional power plant. It's going to be additional industries and transportation. And I think, growing over time is the re-export.","So, we are exporting natural gas from the Dominican Republic to for example, Guyana, Barbados, Haiti, and there are other possibilities as well, and obviously the Central American region has possibilities as well for the export of natural gas.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","But not ready to quantify earnings contributions or earnings growth in that segment?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We think - the potential is maybe $0.05 to $0.04 by 2022. Yeah, in the MCAC. I mean this is not counting, of course what we could be doing in Vietnam. So this is we have - is the Vietnam project it would be another $300 plus million of equity going into the project, and we expect good returns on that as well. So, as you can see, that would be a big contributor to our earnings growth post 2024.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. The $0.04 to $0.05 is off of today is in terms of incremental growth through 2022?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That's correct. That's the opportunity. So, you know in the past we had talked about $0.05 what we basically filled up some of that in the Dominican Republic. So, the additional tank puts us back in another sort of $0.04 to $0.05 of potential upside.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Gordon of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon","Couple of questions, I think you just answered, probably answered one of them, you have $200 million allocated in your - on Slide 25 to Vietnam LNG and CCGT investment, but I was going to ask whether that's the total expected investment because the - I guess it comes online in '24 and you said you actually just said it would be $300 million to $400 million. Is that right?","Gustavo Pimenta","Gustavo here, Greg. That's right. So that is in 2022, so we\u2019re probably going to reach financial close into 2021, spend half of the equity in 2022 which is this 200 that we see in the chart and then 2023 will draw additional $150 million to complement our investment.","Greg Gordon","Yes, and I know you have disclosed contract terms, but you would expect to target like a mid-teens levered equity return on projects with this risk profile. Is that fair?","Gustavo Pimenta","That's about right, yes.","Greg Gordon","And can you give us a sense of what a strategic alliance, like the one you've announced with Google means in terms of your competitive advantage, signing commercial agreements with them and how that translates into confidence in the growth profile at the renewables business. It's just hard to not to be cynical, but it's hard to separate what's a PR announcement versus what has tangible backlog implications?","Gustavo Pimenta","Yes, well, you know Greg, as you know that we've been, I think certainly not people to sort of chase shiny object. We really go to the fundamentals, what does this mean. Now this is a preliminary announcement it has many components to it and we will be providing color as things develop and things materialize. But realize first that we are sort of uniquely positioned to help Google meet its 24\/7 renewable zero carbon energy across the globe.","So we are uniquely positioned to do that. We recently won a bid in Chile for about 125 megawatt to do exactly that. So this is - that was the first stage concrete, there will be others we believe, and as I said, it will be in targeted U.S. and Latin American markets.","Second is to realize that the biggest, the fastest growing sector of corporate demand is web services. So, I believe, Google has announced about 6 gigawatts of need across the globe. So this is, it's a big target, it's growing, and this is the fastest growing corporate sector, what they want is renewable energy around the clock. We are uniquely well positioned to deliver that. So again there will be follow-ons to the Chile deal we believe and stay tuned to that.","In addition, there is some elements of energy management in these locations for us using our portfolio to provide carbon free around the clock energy. Then there is also, I would say on the - on our platform, the opportunity to optimize and continue to deliver cost, cost reductions. So we've been doing spending years quite frankly cleaning up data, because again, a lot of buzzwords that people throw out AI machine learning, it's only as good as the data you have.","So we've been cleaning up the laborious and very hard task of having the right data in place. So we believe by combining our two capabilities. We've been the leader in new applications in our sector. We'll give us really a boost to the cost saving initiatives we have mentioned, it will also give us a boost in terms of delivering on what are continually changing customer expectations.","So, we expect this alliance to make very concrete announcements into the future. So this is not just sort of a feel good PR announcement, it really is that the two of us combined, were leaders in certain areas such as energy storage, energy efficiency solutions in the U.S. So I think it makes a whole lot of sense this is sort of two plus two equals six.","And this is really all of this will be basically upside to what we have and our numbers, and we're going to dedicate people and resources to make sure this is something very concrete. In terms of - what it would really make an impact on our earnings that's probably, I'd say, two or three years out, at a minimum, because and this is really sort of setting the groundwork, could even if you win new power purchase agreements you have to build on these are require additionality. So just to put that in context, I think it's very important, but it's not going to have an immediate impact cost.","Greg Gordon","Last question for you on the Fluence JV obviously making good progress. It doesn't sound like right now, it's actually creating any concrete economic value in terms of cash distributions or earnings contributions to AES Corp, but when do we get to a tipping point where it's either potentially a significant cash flow earnings contributor or is there another way that we monetize this value for shareholders like could this be a standalone sort of public market IPO at some point if it really gets to critical mass. I mean, what are the different ways now that you're really making headway selling the product globally that you can monetize that value for shareholders?","Gustavo Pimenta","Well, as you know, you hit the - I think the nail on the head, it's really how do we monetize that value. This is not - you know a regulated asset, it's a marginal contributor. We have to think about it differently. So we've created a market leader in the market that's growing at 100% per year. It's going to have a major impact on the future of our sector.","So again, it's not a sort of a marginal investment, you have to think about all the value we're creating by this. As I - we mentioned, we are not, it is cash and variable margin positive but that money is going into the business to prepare it for really scaling up, I mean it grew a 100% last year. So you have to scale it up.","So I think it's creating a lot of value for our shareholders directly in the business and some point it will probably make sense to really have a marker out there. So you guys can get a feeling for what it's worth, because we think we've created a lot of value in the business, there are various ways to do that, but I think a marker, would be very good to be able to put it into what's its value within the AES portfolio. But I have no doubt that this is going to be a major part of our business going forward. And I mean our sector going forward.","And do realize that it is giving us a competitive advantage in winning renewable PPAs, because we know as much as anybody about how to integrate energy storage and some very exciting developments coming in the Fluence space. So stay tuned, in terms of products, in terms of new ideas.","So for example, one in Chile, we making the world's first virtual reservoir or you can take a run of the river hydro, which is Las Lajas and really instead of having to dispatch the energy 24\/7 you can quite frankly not dispatch it when energy prices are low, mostly due to solar and inject that energy when prices are much higher. So there's a lot of innovation going down it's very exciting.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Christopher Turnure","I just wanted to go through the quarter a little bit here in 2019 as a whole in terms of kind of nonrecurring items. So $0.48 for the third quarter, adjusted EPS, is it fair that the $0.05 of insurance proceeds there are nonrecurring? And with, I guess, plants back online in Panama now, anything else to think about for the fourth quarter or continuing into 2020 in relationship to that?","Gustavo Pimenta","Chris, Gustavo here. No, not really, I think the $0.05 is recurring because it's a catch-up from the first half, we may recall in the second call - second quarter call, as we mentioned that our first half was slightly weaker versus our expectation due to those outages and we expected to recover a large portion of that impact in Q3, Q4 and that's what happened, so it's - it's really a catch-up from the first half, you should read this as a first half figure and not as - as a one-time. So that's what it is.","Christopher Turnure","And then I think you said kind of net of the insurance, it would still be $0.01 negative for you for the Panama outage, at least, so that why the kind of your 2020 number - or there would be kind of no residual effects going to 2020, the net '19 number would be almost not impacted?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That's correct. That's correct.","Christopher Turnure","And any other kind of nonrecurring items helping or hurting Q3 in terms of having a meaningful effect?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Not really, I think the one that I pointed out in my remarks, was tax, it's relatively within the range on a year-to-date basis, but you may recall, last year we had unusual low tax rate. So that is one thing for us, that would probably it won't be happening in the Q4 of this year, but a part of that nothing - no one-time-ish.","Christopher Turnure","And then just, I guess, a little bit longer term, when we look at what's occurred so far this year, after you introduced your kind of new long-term plan or rolled forward your long-term plan back in February. You've reached investment grade, maybe a little bit faster than the plan, interest rates have been kind of going in your favor and everyone's favor, some LNG success certainly has materialized maybe partly offset by the Ohio DMR situation. I'm just wondering kind of where the bigger maybe surprises versus your plan have occurred, if any, your long-term plan, that is?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, Chris, I agree with everything except what you said about the DMR. We think that continue to feel good about the successful resolution of this, so we agree that we've had some upside. And I think quite frankly those things which are under control we've consistently I think over delivered whether it's paying down debt, reducing costs growing the LNG business are growing renewables. So, that's true, but we really don't see that the - I wouldn't put the DMR is - we continue to feel good about it and it remains on track.","Christopher Turnure","So kind of rolling all that together, it sounds like you feel like you're executing on your plan and really not getting ahead of yourselves at all in terms of some of the positives that have occurred?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Again, we are executing on our plan and I think we've delivered some things ahead of schedule that is certainly true. I mean we have been talking about getting our sort of the investment grade stats this year and, but we upfronted that we paid down more debt. I think it's very important that we said we pay down $150 million of recourse debt, we paid down of $450 million. So we have been over-delivering.","Operator","Our next question is from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Good morning, Andr\u00e9s, first question, I recall, I think it was maybe last quarter or two quarters back when you roll forward your growth aspirations and came up with the 7% to 9% growth rate for '18 through '22. At that time, you had also told us that the old growth rate, which was '17 through '20 and 8% to 10% that you would end up at the high end of that growth rate. I just want to confirm that that's still your conviction as we sit here today.","Gustavo Pimenta","Yes. Gustavo, here. The short answer is yes. We will be providing color on February, but as I said in my remarks, we are reaffirming the 7% to 9% and to your question, yes, that's our expectation.","Ali Agha","Second question, looking through your numbers year-to-date, you got about $124 million of distribution from Argentina to the Parent. Is that a good number on a run rate for the annual Argentine cash flow subsidiary distributions and how should we think about the capital controls that are currently in place or your prior experience perhaps in dealing with the leftist government in terms of what the cash flow implications and offsets could be going forward?","Gustavo Pimenta","Okay. Yes. Regarding Argentina, no that's not a - the run rate, what we had said in the past, as you know that we had three years where we did not distribute dollar dividends from Argentina. And so there was a catch-up in recent years. Now having a portfolio like ours as Gustavo mentioned in his speech, we don't expect this to affect us and also in Argentina is one that is a little bit of up and downs. We've been there in good times, we've been there in bad times.","We've always made money, even in 2002 we made money in Argentina that I think reflects the quality of our assets and the fact that they're very lowly levered. So this is not the sort of the run rate with current exchange controls in place, we don't expect to be paying material dividends out of Argentina, certainly next year. But we've always, you know it's again operated well there.","We have put a big back-office there. And so that's one way of, quite frankly, if you will, dollarizing is by using our pesos in Argentina to get services which are worth dollars to us. So that helps offset to some of this. So to be clear, in Argentina, we've always made money, we've always been capable of paying dividends, just we haven't always been able to buy the dollar.","So if you look historically, the average is more like $70 million or so, and it's been like 5% to 6% of subsidiary distributions over time. So, and this is quite frankly what I expect in Argentina, it's kind of up and downs. But it's, we've operated well there and I expect this getting sort of up and downs, but it's not something that's going to materially affect our forecast.","Ali Agha","And then finally, Andr\u00e9s, another topic that in prior quarters, used to get more attention, but we're not hearing much about is but - Merits and Bulgaria. Can you just give us an update of everything that's going on there on the contract or what your expectations are looking forward?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Sure. Really we have nothing new to report on merits so that's why it wasn't part of our speech. We continue to be paid on time. The plant is being dispatched and now we're entering the winter season, which becomes even more important, they are up to date on their payments, the off-takers financial situation, NEK is strong. The country is growing strong, and it remains investment grade. So those things continue.","And regarding the illegal state aid case in front of the European Commission, our advisors continue to talk. So we have no official case yet and they continue to talk. And so, as I - we said before, we have really nothing new to report, but the asset is doing well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","On Andr\u00e9s on the Vietnam contract. Okay, the projects approved by Vietnam and you said you're in negotiations I guess for the long-term contracts, with the contracts be with the government or were you referring to contracts with LNG in quarters what contracts are those?","Gustavo Pimenta","Charl, that's a good question. Basically look there are two projects both supporting each other. So, the first is the 480 tera BTU regasification and storage terminal. So to put that in context. Today, we have about 150 tera BTUs between Panama and the Dominican Republic, with the additional 50 tera BTUs that will go to about 200 tera BTUs. So this is a very large project. Now in this case, we have about 38% of the project and PetroVietnam has the remainder. So we have a partner in this project.","So, where will the gas go? There is about 6 gigawatts I believe of gas five turbine in Vietnam. There had been using offshore gas, which is running out. So there will be immediately a demand for the LNG terminal.","In addition to our 2.2 gigawatts of combined cycle gas plant, which would be using that gas. Now in the second project on the combined cycle gas turbine plants. The 2.2 gigawatts we own 100% of that. So when we talk about contracts or different contracts. So one would be of course of the contract between the LNG terminal and the generators, including ourselves. Then there is the off-take of the energy and capacity coming from the 2.2 gigawatts of new generation.","And I realize we have a 1.3 gigawatt plant already in Vietnam, Mong Duong 2which has done very well performing, it is one of the best performers in the country, we built it on time and on budget. As a long-term dollar-based contract, it's been paying on time. So basically, it would be like a repeat of Longjiang-2 only burning gas this time.","The other contracts for example between the supply of gas to this is Son My 2 is the name of the terminal that contracts have yet to be negotiated and obviously would be PetroVietnam and ourselves negotiating with U.S. gas suppliers. So those have yet been negotiated. But in general the - it's a very firm commitment by us and then by the Government of Vietnam to do this project.","And so I'd say the one thing that distinguishes it from, say, the projects in Panama and the Dominican Republic, is that - the demand is there. So it's not a question of building a terminal storage facility where the anchor tenant plant that you build a 30% of it. In this case it's going to be use - the use is going to be much, much faster, getting to the 90% plus usage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill of UBS. Please go ahead.","Gregg Orrill","Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could touch on the BHP contract, BHP buyout of a PPA in Chile and whether that was a driver for the return of capital increase that you reported in the quarter?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","So there are two part. The - responding to the second, absolutely no, nothing has occurred yet. This will take effect two years. So it hasn't affected our returns of ASN there at all at this point. The second was that you know BHP has a - let's say a mandate from Corp to go green. So they put out a bid for 6 terawatt hours of new energy and what came back was basically about may a bit more than half of it was existing hydros in Chile. The other ones are renewables.","So this will replace our existing contract. No, our contracts, generally we make our money on the capacity payments, energy is a pass-through. So for our contract, they have to make us whole, if they're not going to use our capacity.","So they have mentioned a number in their press release of a value of about $780 million. This has yet to be absolute - the exact number has yet to be negotiated. We think it's sort of around $800 million, but this is yet to be negotiated. But basically this shows, I think the strength of our contracts in Chile, you know lot of people are questioning the value of these contracts.","And I think this shows that these contracts are very solid. So they will pay us for this future - the present value of that future capacity it was running through 2029. And there is still about - plant is about 20% contracted. And so this will be - it's a business decision by BHP and it's I think shows the strength of our contracts and the business in Chile.","Gregg Orrill","Do you think that will impact your growth rate guidance?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, absolutely not.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks.","Ahmed Pasha","We thank everybody for joining us on today's call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any follow-up questions you may have. Next week, we look forward to see - seeing many of you at the EEI conference in Orlando. Thanks again and have a nice day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded today, Thursday, November 6, 2014 at 9:00 Eastern Time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to your host for today's call, Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to AES' Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our senior management team","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andres. Andres?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. Today, I will discuss our current financial outlook and provide an update on the execution of our strategy and plans to create value for our shareholders.","Overall, while we are reaffirming our medium to long-term cash and earning projections, we are lowering our near-term guidance as a result of the persistent drought in Latin America and weak foreign currency exchange rates. Despite disappointing short-term expectations, we are executing well against our strategic objectives of reducing our footprint and costs and growing our business platforms profitably. To date, we're ahead of our expectations on asset sales and on track on our cost reductions.","Our construction pipeline represents $9 billion in investments and more than 7,000 megawatts of additional capacity and upgrades. And this year, we plan to return up to $480 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, the highest amount in AES' history.","On this call, I will provide a discussion of our 2014 outlook, an update on macro trends that we're seeing across our portfolio, a review of our accomplishments since our second quarter call in August and my thoughts on capital allocation. Tom will then provide a detailed discussion of our results and guidance.","Turning to Slide 4. As I mentioned, 2014 has been a very challenging year for AES with headwinds from poor hydrology and untimely plant outages. At the time of our last call, we expected poor hydrology to have an impact of $0.07 to $0.10 per share on our full year earnings, with an additional negative impact of $0.06 from plant outages. At that time, we expected to offset most of this impact through improved operational performance, accelerated G&A savings and capital allocation, and be able to achieve the low end of our guidance range.","However, based on our 9-month performance and our updated outlook for the remainder of the year, we have revised our 2014 guidance to a range of $1.25 to $1.31. This revision reflects our current view of hydrology, which we now expect to have a negative impact of $0.10. The reduction also includes a $0.02 impact from a modestly higher effective tax rate.","Now I would like to review some macro trends that we're seeing across our portfolio and provide an update on a few of our businesses, beginning on Slide 5. Poor hydrology in Latin America has had a substantial impact on our earnings over the past 2 years. Although short-term weather conditions are difficult to predict, our numbers are based on a return to normal hydrology in 2015.","In Panama, where we have experienced the worst hydrology in the last 50 years, we are encouraged by the higher-than-expected inflows and the recovery in reservoir levels in September and October. In Brazil, reservoir levels are currently at approximately 23%, which is about half the historical average for this time of year, causing elevated spot prices. The rainy season begins at the end of November, so we will have more insight into 2015 at the time of our fourth quarter call in February.","We're also seeing a slowdown in global markets that is affecting currencies, interest rates, commodities and GDP growth expectations. While we largely manage market risk through contracts, fuel pass-throughs and hedging strategies, we have some residual exposure to these fluctuations. Relative to the long-term outlook we provided in February, we're now projecting more unfavorable euro and Brazilian real exchange rates and lower GDP growth and higher interest rates in Brazil.","In 2017 and '18, the headwinds from foreign currency devaluation and lower GDP growth in Brazil are expected to continue, but are offset by improvements at DP&L, driven by higher dark spreads and revenue. Therefore, net-net, our earnings power remains basically unchanged from our prior expectations. Accordingly, we have lowered our 2015 and 2016 adjusted EPS outlook and we are reaffirming our 2017 and 2018 earnings power, as well as our 10% to 15% cash flow growth for 2015 through 2018. Tom will discuss our guidance and expectations in greater detail in a few minutes.","Now I will provide a few business updates beginning on Slide 6. In Bulgaria, a new energy regulator was appointed in September, and a 10% increase in the end user electricity tariff was announced soon after. This tariff increase is a step towards improving the liquidity of Maritza's offtaker, NEK. Furthermore, we have been reassured by the regulator that our capacity is critical to the Bulgarian electric system and will remain an important part of their energy mix. In October, elections were held and we are awaiting the formation of a new government before resuming meaningful conversations on the outstanding issues.","Turning to Slide 7. As you may have seen in the press recently, the coal allocation for most private companies, including our 1,320 megawatt OPGC II project, currently under construction, were canceled by the Supreme Court of India. Although there is no clear resolution at this point, with or without a direct coal allocation, we believe that OPGC II is still an attractive growth project for us. The plant is located in the state of Odisha, which has the second largest coal reserves in India. And we currently operate OPGC I adjacent to the site of OPGC II that utilizes coal supplied by Coal India. We are working on multiple options to optimize the coal supply to OPGC II and deliver much needed electricity in India once the plant is operational by 2018.","Next, turning to Slide 8. In our accomplishments since our second quarter call in August. With 3 new transactions, we have made continued progress towards reducing the complexity of our portfolio and expanding our access to capital. We announced the sale of 100% of our interest in assets in Turkey. We also closed the sale of our operating wind projects in the United Kingdom and we brought in a strong local partner for our business in the Dominican Republic with the sell down of 8% of our position. These transactions represent a total of $382 million in equity proceeds to AES, which translates into 13x 2015 earnings.","With these proceeds, we are 76% of the way towards the goal we announced this year of realizing $500 million in asset sale proceeds by December 2015. As a reminder, since September 2011, we have announced a total of $2.4 billion in asset sale proceeds to AES and announced our exit from 9 countries. This quarter, we have also achieved a number of substantial milestones on key platform expansions. As you can see on Slide 9, we have more than 7,000 megawatts under construction, the largest construction pipeline in AES' history. The total investment in these projects is $9 billion, of which our equity portion is $1.5 billion and $1.1 billion has already been funded.","Our projected ROE on those projects is greater than 15%. Although our current earnings do not reflect any return from these investments other than at IPL, these projects will be contributing roughly $0.30 of adjusted EPS and more than $200 million in dividends to the parent on an annual basis once they have all come online by the end of 2018.","Since our second quarter earnings call in August, we closed financing and broke around on 2 additional projects.","Turning to Slide 10. In the Dominican Republic, we are closing the cycle at our DPP plant, which will increase output by 122 megawatts to 358 megawatts, without using any additional fuel. We are funding 100% of this project with available debt capacity in the Dominican Republic through $260 million in nonrecourse debt, including participation by the IFC. This project is fully contracted and is expected to come online early in 2017.","Turning to Slide 11. In Panama, we recently acquired a 72 megawatt fuel oil-fired power barge and signed a 5-year PPA with a state-owned generation company for its capacity. The barge will be online early next year and modestly diversifies our portfolio in Panama away from hydro. In the U.S., we achieved important milestones on 2 development projects with a total project cost of $2.2 billion, which will likely be funded with a combination of debt, partner equity and AES equity.","Turning to Slide 12. In California, where we currently own and operate almost 4,000 megawatts of gas-fired capacity, we were recently awarded a new 20-year Power Purchase Agreement by Southern California Edison. We will build and operate a 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle, gas-fired generation and 100 megawatts of battery-based energy storage to replace older capacity in the western Los Angeles Basin.","I'm particularly excited about the energy storage award. And this is the first time this technology has successfully competed against traditional peaking capacity to win a long-term PPA. The award of these PPAs is a recognition of our ability to deliver innovative power solutions through a combination of our expertise and a locational advantage of our existing power plant sites.","As our largest growth investment in the United States, this new capacity in California sets a solid foundation for continued earnings and cash flow contribution from Southland for years to come.","Turning to Slide 13. In Indiana, IPL continues to grow by modernizing its fleet and is seeking approval from the regulator for a $332 million investment to comply with wastewater regulations and to convert our Harding Street Station from coal to natural gas. If approved, the majority of this investment will begin earning regulated returns during construction. When combined with the $1 billion investment in projects currently under construction at IPL, these projects represent an increase in rate base of 70%.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Tom, I want to share my thoughts on capital allocation. Moving on to Slide 14. I would like to review the significant progress we have made towards enhancing long-term shareholder value through our strategy of disciplined capital allocation, which we outlined in late 2011.","Since then, we've invested $1.6 billion to reduce or refinance debt, which has helped us lower our corporate debt by 20% and our interest expense by $140 million annually. We've also returned $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In fact, since 2011, we have lowered our share count by 9% by repurchasing 72 million shares at an average price of $12.43. Furthermore, we have selectively invested $831 million, primarily in growth projects. As I mentioned earlier, these platform expansions, projects, will represent an important component of our earnings and cash flow growth going forward.","Turning to Slide 15. We expect to have substantial excess capital available to us going forward. Our diversified portfolio generates strong parent free cash flow, which is projected to grow at 10% to 15% annually on average through 2018, providing us with the wherewithal to fund growth projects across our key markets and deliver strong returns to shareholders. Additional asset sales proceeds, including bringing in partners would increase our available discretionary cash. But even without assuming any additional asset sales, we believe that available discretionary cash could total approximately $3 billion from 2015 through 2018.","Approximately $400 million of this will be required to fund our remaining equity commitment for projects currently under construction. A minimum of $580 million will be used for dividend. That is the amount we would pay if we assume we hold dividends constant at the current level of $145 million annually. Considering the amount of parent debt that we've already prepaid, we believe that additional meaningful debt repayments aren't necessary for the next few years. The remaining $1.9 billion is therefore available for investment at attractive growth projects and returning cash to shareholders through buybacks and\/or dividend increases.","After dividend growth, which I will discuss in a moment, our other 2 alternatives for investment of our discretionary cash are growth projects and share repurchases. First, we have a strong pipeline of growth opportunities, including the IPL upgrades and Southland repowering, I just discussed, as well as additional platform expansions such as Masinloc 2, Mong Duong 3 and energy storage. Of course, as we have demonstrated, we are likely to bring in equity partners from many of these growth projects to optimize our returns and market exposures.","Second, we view share repurchases as the benchmark against which all other investment decisions are measured. And as such, they remain a key part of our capital allocation. Although some of the macro factors that I have discussed this morning are having an impact on our near-term earnings and cash flow. Our portfolio continues to generate strong and growing cash flow, which we will continue to invest to create value for shareholders.","Our board has increased our repurchase authorization to $150 million. In the past, we have indicated that we will be opportunistic with respect to the timing of buybacks. This time, we intend to use the majority of this authorization by the end of this year.","Turning to Slide 16. With respect to the dividend, I appreciate that the current level of $0.20 per share or $145 million is relatively low, given our strong cash flow. We believe there is room to grow the dividend, particularly since our current payout ratio is at the lower end of our 30% to 40% of sustainable parent free cash flow, and we see robust 10% to 15% annual growth in our parent free cash flow. As you know, we typically review the dividend with our board in December.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Thanks, Andres, and good morning, everyone. While we're disappointed that macro factors, higher working capital requirements and increased receivables have delayed our growth in near-term earnings and cash flow projections, our long-term outlook has not changed. In an effort to remain as transparent as possible, we are providing our 2015 guidance and longer-term expectations today, a quarter earlier than our normal practice. I'll go with the details after discussion of our third quarter results.","Turning to Slide 18. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was $0.37 compared to $0.39 in the third quarter last year. Four of our strategic business units experienced strong adjusted PTC growth, driven by higher revenue and gross margin. However, these gains were offset by lower contributions from Brazil, largely due to poor hydrology and the plant outage at Masinloc in the Philippines in July, resulting in overall decline in our earnings for the quarter of $0.02.","Our results also reflect a $0.01 impact from the sale of a minority interest in Masinloc, which was largely offset by the benefits of capital allocation. We also benefited from a slightly lower tax rate during the quarter.","Before I go over our businesses in more detail, I'd like to comment on the $0.02 negative impact during the quarter from low hydrology on Slide 19.","Our generation business in Brazil, Tiet\u00ea, saw a $0.04 impact from hydro. The system inflows were lower relative to last year resulting in higher spot prices impacting Tiet\u00ea who's had to cover part of the contract position in the open market. As we discussed on our last call, Tiet\u00ea was net long in the first half of the year and short in the second half. Consequently, although their margins benefited in the first half, Tiet\u00ea is now covering some of its contract position in the spot market.","In Panama, where hydro is now improving, we had a $0.01 adverse impact from hydrology. This represents a $0.02 improvement over last year. Partially offsetting Brazil and Panama was a $0.03 benefit from hydro at Chivor in Colombia, where our facility had stronger inflows versus the rest of the country, allowing us to benefit from short-term sales at attractive prices. This brings our overall year-to-date hydro impact to $0.06, and we now expect the full year impact to be $0.10 a share versus $0.13 last year.","Turning to Slide 20, I'll discuss each of our SBUs, focusing on adjusted PTC or PTC. In the U.S., we reported an increase of $24 million in PTC. This was largely driven by higher non-bypassable revenues at DPL, which were approved late last year and contributions from our wind businesses. In our Andes SBU, PTC increased $11 million, driven largely by higher volumes and prices in Colombia due to the hydrology I just covered. Next in Brazil, PTC decreased $84 million for the quarter. This includes about $50 million at Tiet\u00ea, largely due to poor hydrology as I just discussed. Additionally, our utilities experienced higher costs, primarily related to storms at Sul. Moving to MCAC. PTC increased $28 million, primarily driven by higher rates and lower fuel costs in the Dominican Republic. We also saw an improvement in Panama as a result of the actions we've taken to reduce the impact of poor hydrology.","Turning to EMEA on Slide 21. PTC increased $13 million, largely driven by higher availability at Maritza in Bulgaria and contributions from our IPP4 Jordan plant, which came online in July. Finally, in Asia, PTC declined by $28 million. As you may recall, our second quarter results this year were affected by an outage at Masinloc in the Philippines, which continued into July. Further, the results reflect the sale of 45% of our stake in Masinloc, which was completed during the quarter.","To summarize this quarter, after corporate costs, we earned $354 million in adjusted pretax earnings and $0.30 adjusted EPS. As you can see on Slide 22, we are revising our 2014 adjusted PTC modeling ranges to reflect the same drivers as our revised adjusted EPS guidance, Andres just discussed.","We provided new PTC modeling ranges by SBU in the appendix of today's slide deck as well.","Year-to-date we've earned $937 million in adjusted PTC, which is 71% of the midpoint of our revised PTC range. After taking into account a 1% increase in our expected tax rate, which is now expected to be 31% to 33%, we're forecasting full year adjusted EPS of $1.25 to $1.31, with $0.89 already earned year-to-date.","We expect higher earnings in the fourth quarter relative to $0.29 earned last year. Our fourth quarter 2013 results included the $0.04 provision we booked for potential customer refunds at Eletropaulo in Brazil. Further, our fourth quarter '14 results will benefit from improved operations in Chile and at IPL in the U.S., lower G&A and lower parent interest.","Now to cash flow on Slide 23. We generated $427 million of proportional free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date proportional free cash flow to $604 million versus $923 million in the first 9 months of last year. With our year-to-date performance and factoring in the impacts from working capital requirements in Brazil, Bulgaria and Chile, we now expect full year 2014 proportional free cash flow of $900 million to $1 billion. Year-to-date, we've achieved 60% of the midpoint of our revised guidance range and we now expect about $300 million to $400 million of proportional free cash flow during the fourth quarter, which is in line with the $349 million generated in the fourth quarter last year.","Now to Slide 24 in our capital allocation plan for the year. Starting on the left, we project roughly $1.7 billion of discretionary cash, this includes about $1 billion of cash from announced asset sales except Turkey, which we expect to receive next year. I'd like to highlight that although we're lowering our proportional free cash flow guidance for the year, we still expect to generate $500 million of parent free cash flow.","Turning to uses on the right-hand side. We've allocated about $330 million this year for a portion of our equity commitments to investments in subsidiaries, primarily for platform expansion projects under construction. So far in '14, we've used roughly $500 million for debt reduction and refinancing, and expect to use about $100 million more during the remainder of the year. Approximately half of this prepayment is to maintain credit neutrality following asset sales, while the remaining amount is discretionary in an effort to accelerate our credit metric improvement and reduce financial risk, consistent with our previously stated balanced capital allocation strategy.","In terms of returning cash to shareholders. On the last call, we outlined our plan to return at least $300 million to shareholders this year. With $182 million of share repurchases so far, plus our annual dividend of $145 million, we're already returning $327 million to shareholders in 2014. Further, as Andres mentioned, we expect to invest another $150 million in our stock, largely by year end, which will bring total cash returned to shareholders in 2014 of up to above $475 million. After target closing cash balance of $100 million, we're projecting roughly $200 million of unallocated cash remaining at the end of 2014. For simplicity, we've assumed that this cash is carried over into '15. Of course, we may use some of that before year end.","Now to Slide 25. I'd like to provide some insight into our plans for capital allocation for 2015. We expect parent free cash flow of roughly $525 million and $125 million in proceeds from the sale of our businesses in Turkey. Together with about $300 million of unallocated cash carryover from '14, this would put our total discretionary cash at about $1 billion in 2015. At this point, we expect to use this cash to fund roughly $200 million in equity commitments in our projects currently under construction as well as make dividends of $145 million at the current rate. This would leave us with about $550 million of unallocated cash in 2015, without assuming any additional asset sales. We'll continue to require new growth investments to compete against share repurchases. We have ample capacity to also increase the dividend.","Now to Slide 26. Last February, we provided an initial outlook on earnings growth for 2015 through 2018. And today, I'd like to provide an update on those expectations. We've seen a stronger U.S. dollar, which has affected us mainly in Brazil and Europe. Further in Brazil, we've lowered our GDP growth expectations and we're experiencing higher interest rates. The impact from these macro factors is about $0.05 per year in 2015 and '16. Accordingly, we've lowered our 2015 and '16 expectations and are introducing a 2015 guidance range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share. We expect flat to modest growth in 2016 consistent with our prior expectations although from a lower earnings base. However, the level of earnings power that we now expect for 2017 and 2018 remains unchanged with the macro headwinds I just discussed continuing through '17 and '18, but are offset by some improvements, largely at DPL.","We continue to expect that our projects under construction will drive our earnings growth, which is now 8% to 10% off the lower 2016 base.","Turning to Slide 27. Although we include a modest contingency in our estimates, key assumptions in our 2015 guidance include: first, a return to normal hydrology in 2015; second, currency and commodity forward curves as of mid-October of this year. As always, we're providing sensitivities in the appendix of today's deck.","Finally, a 31% to 33% effective tax rate, which assumes that the CFC look-through rule is extended. We believe the Congress will extend the CFC look-through later this year. However, if it is not extended, the impact on 2015 earnings could be a negative $0.06, after considering mitigating actions we're currently pursuing. And this impact would be, of course, noncash, given we have nearly $3 billion of NOLs outstanding. Further, if the CFC look-through rule is not extended, we'll continue to pursue actions to mitigate the impact as we've done in the past.","Shifting to cash flow on Slide 28. Despite the reduction in our near-term earnings expectations, we're maintaining our cash flow outlook for 2018. We continue to expect 10% to 15% average annual growth in our proportional free cash flow as well as in our parent free cash flow. In 2015, our expectation is for between $1 billion and $1.35 billion in proportional free cash flow. This range implies an increase of roughly $225 million over the midpoint of our 2014 revised guidance. Approximately half of this increase is expected from the recovery of working capital, mostly from our utilities in Brazil and in Gener. The remaining amount is expected from improved availability at DPL and improved hydrology in Latin America. We continue to believe proportional free cash flow is one of our key value drivers with a strong double-digit growth over the longer term. We'll continue to show the value of our cash flow through disciplined capital allocation that maximizes risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders.","With that, I'll now turn it back to Andres.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Tom. To summarize, despite lowering our near-term expectations, we're executing our strategic objectives, including narrowing our geographic focus and reducing costs while expanding our platforms in a profitable manner. We are ahead of our expectations on asset sales and on track for cost reductions. Our construction pipeline represents $9 billion in total project cost or 7,141 megawatts of additional capacity in upgrades, which is the largest amount in AES' 33-year history. This year, we expect to return up to $480 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and we believe that we will have significant capacity to return cash to shareholders in the future.","With that, we look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI financial conference in Dallas next week.","And now, I'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ali Agha of SunTrust.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Andres, I guess my first question to you -- you mentioned that the board will look at the dividend in December and you currently have this 30% to 40% payout ratio on your free cash flow. And the consistent message that you've given us is that your cash flow growth profile for the next several years far exceeds your earnings profile. Is there any thought by management to revisit the payout ratio and perhaps rebate the dividend on a higher payout ratio? Also, given the conditions and the fact that the market certainly in today's environment is more supportive of higher-yielding securities and your higher free cash flow story would resonate more with investors if you were able to demonstrate to us a higher payout ratio. Any thought on that?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","That's a very good observation, Ali. I think that today, we're at about 29% payout ratio, 29% payout [ph]. We have said that our policy is a payout ratio between 30% and 40%. So we are -- at this stage, what I would say is we want to maintain ourselves in that ratio, and that's what we will be discussing. But I think you raise a good issue and we will have the opportunity to look at that in the future. But right now, what I'd say is we want to be within the 30% to 40%. And currently, we're below that at about 29%.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I understand that and we will discuss this more perhaps at EEI. My second question for you is with regards to the earnings profile that you laid out for us and, obviously, the previous 4% to 6% guidance growth through '16 no longer is valid, given the new numbers. And so I guess a 2-part question. One, the $0.05 of macro headwinds that are incremental. I'm surprised given the size of your portfolio, that there weren't other offsetting factors that you could come up with, whether it's cost reductions or perhaps even more aggressive buybacks and capital allocation to offset that because $0.05 in the scheme of things is not that big of a number. I guess that's part one. And part 2, the normal hydrology that you have assumed for '15, how confident are you, given that, as you mentioned, the Brazilian rainy season hasn't even started yet and might we be looking at another potential reduction to the '15 numbers?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay, Ali. Let's take it by parts. In terms of the first one, the cost reductions. We're aggressively pursuing cost reductions. As we've stated, now we're moving from G&A to fixed costs in our business and we have an addressable spend of around $3 billion that we're going after. And we're working hard on this. Now it does take some time because this is -- we have 38,000 megawatts under our management. And this requires standardization, this requires testing, this requires aggregations. So that's well underway and I think that Andy and the team are doing a great job there, but that does take some time. But we certainly are pulling all levers to meet our commitment. I can assure you of that. But on the other hand, we want to make sure that everything we do is really creating a sustainable long-term shareholder value. So we're not going to make cuts that could, say, harm the value of this company going forward. I assure you, we are pulling all levers, and I think we've demonstrated we're quite good at that. I think we have a good track record in terms of that. The second in terms -- question regarding hydrology. I would say, break it into parts. We've had this unusual event that the hydrology was correlated negatively, quite frankly, everywhere, for the prior 2 years. Now even with the $0.10 negative impact, this is $0.03 less than it was in 2013. So we have improved. Part of it is some of the actions that we've taken on commercial policy, that we've taken with regards to Panama. Now we are seeing differences. In Panama, as I mentioned, we're actually seeing very good inflows into the reservoirs in September, October and carrying over to the first week here in November. So in Panama, we are seeing a recovery of the hydro. The question really is a little bit, some transmission constraints. But in terms of the physical rainfall in Panama, we've seen a significant recovery. In the case of Colombia, Chivor is in a different watershed than a lot of the country's hydro, and so it's actually done quite well, as Tom mentioned, because it's had a better relative rainfall than the rest of the country. So in Colombia -- in Panama, we see things better. In Brazil, it's still too early to tell. We got this question a lot, whether -- the situation in Brazil regarding 2014 at the beginning of the year. At that time, we said that we did not see rationing as the most likely scenario, that it was not likely to occur this year. All the studies I have seen for 2015 indicates that rationing is possible, but it's not the most likely scenario at this point. And as I mentioned in the past, if we compare this to 2001, the Brazilian government has about 10 gigawatts of thermal capacity and is executing quite well in terms of using the water, let's say, holding back on the water and using hydro. Now this will depend -- quite frankly, we really have no way of predicting when the rains will come at the end of November, beginning of December and they run through April, and that's what we'll have to see what happens at that time and how they handle it. Now there are different scenarios. It obviously would depend on the degree of -- if there were to be any rationing, the degree of it; the degree of compensations and what would be the price cap. So we'll give you information on the Q4 update when we have a better view. But it's difficult to predict whether in the short-term and what we monitor very closely are the reservoir levels and the actions that the government is taking to comply with it. And also quite frankly, it's a question of demand as well. It will be a question of how hot it is in the fourth quarter in Brazil, first quarter in Brazil and the economic recovery as well.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","My last question. In your capital allocation for 2014, as -- Tom, as you mentioned, there's still about $200 million that you kind of unallocated and maybe even assume it sticks around till the year end. Any reason why you didn't add that to the $150 million of buyback that you've indicated to us? Or is it possible that some or all of that $200 million is added on to the $150 million of buyback by year end?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Ali, I think it's -- I think I thought with the $150 million was to put out a number that we thought we could execute the majority of it by year end and it's step-by-step. I think we've shown that we put out more modest-size amounts, we execute on them and then we think about the next steps going forward.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, Ali, I think what's important here -- I think we've shown that we really do compete new investments against buybacks and we've always been able to get the authorizations that we need to do more buybacks. But as Tom said, we think this is the correct amount for this year. And also in terms of the total return to shareholders of this year, it will be a new record for AES. So we feel that we've made the right capital allocation decisions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to revisit your Ohio generation assets, just given we've seen some potentially favorable developments there. Has that at all altered your appetite for considering monetizing some or all of those assets?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","What I would say is that, at this stage, we're happy with our decision. As you remember, we ran a sales process. We didn't think the price was right. I think that the market has moved in a favorable direction since then. So we feel that we made the correct decision in holding on to them and we're -- there's a number of things which could occur in the PJM and in Ohio, specifically, that could even improve the value further. So what I'd say at this stage, we're happy with our decision to hold that we made this year.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Understood. But you're not necessarily wedded to that decision in the long-term if conditions changed and value were to change for those assets?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, again, we tend to think in terms of the medium term with our assets. In terms of the value we can create. We are talking about costs and synergies. You need to be able to plan into the medium term, and I think we also think about this in terms of our portfolio. One of the things we've done is bringing partners to reduce our exposure to certain risks, to increase, quite frankly, our capacity to do bigger projects. So we will always figure into that mix. But we also do portfolio fine-tuning. So I wouldn't exclude it, but what I'm saying is that what we are doing now is really trying to optimize our portfolio by bringing in partners and really looking at the mix of assets we have that give us really the best risk-adjusted return.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then just shifting over to the California contracts. Would it be possible for you to give us a sense of the aggregate EBITDA that's associated with these contracts?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Stephen, it's Tom. I'd say it's tough. It's obviously, fresh off the presses. So we've been through a pretty rigorous competitive situation, so I think we may, at some point, but I think it's a little too early for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Turnure of JPMorgan.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sticking on the theme of the SoCal Ed contracts that were announced yesterday. Could you kind of walk us through the long-term plan there? I know you have at least another gigawatt of potential capacity that you can kind of repower there. What are you thinking about that? What are you thinking about the 500 or so that you could just sell for other uses right now to redevelop that property? And how does all of this, including yesterday's contracts kind of fit into the idea that you are losing EBITDA, I guess at the end of 2018, because the existing contracts will go off?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. I think this is a good point. We have like, 4,000 megawatts. This is a very important step in terms of getting about 1,300 megawatts under a PPA in California. And we are looking at -- the main site is Huntington Beach. We also have Alamitos and we will be looking at what to do with the other sites. I think what's important here is the 100 megawatts of energy storage that we mentioned. And in the energy storage space, they often talk about resource that can be positive and negative. So this is 200 megawatts of resource, which is equivalent to the 100% of what we all have done to date. So that -- again, getting to your question here, Southern California is important to us. We'll be looking at getting the maximum value out of these sites. Our locational advantage is very important. We're very happy to have won this contract. And yes, we'll continue to focus on it. But at this time, what I'd say is you're correct. These new PPAs start in 2020 and we have to make sure that we have sufficient total presence there to offset everything that we'd be retiring.","Christopher Turnure - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then switching gears to the Dominican Republic. You guys sold that small stake of the assets there. Kind of, can you speak to the future of that business? What you were thinking in terms of the sale price there, the multiple that you got on valuation? And was it kind of more of a price motive? Or was it a strategic motive that drove you to make that decision?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, that's a good question. It was definitely a strategic motive. We've been doing very well in the Dominican Republic. There are really only 2 modern regasification facilities in the Caribbean, and this is one of them. The other one is in Puerto Rico. So this business has done well. As you know, we are selling compressed gas to third parties for vehicles and for other industrial purposes on the island. And this is very solid business. The gas that we bring in is at Henry Hub base. So what we saw here is that there's a potential to do more in the Dominican Republic, but we thought it was very important to have, say, a deeper relationship with the country and that's why we wanted to have local participation in our projects. So we are expanding, as you see, with DPP, that's a very efficient project where we're closing the cycle. We won't be, of course, burning any more fuel, but we'll get 122 more megawatts. So it really was a strategic motive. Now in terms of the big business, what do we see there? We see there is still upside potential from our regasification and storage facility there, and we could see that in the future having a little bit sort of hub and spoke system from the Dominican Republic. Now, of course, this -- we would have -- our business is the large business. It's the holding facility, so others could come and use our facility. But we see upside potential in the Dominican Republic from the very strong base that we have in gas.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first, turning back to the Southern California for a quick second. Can you talk about sort of the net EPS change after the contracts roll off or the existing contracts roll off into the next round with the 3 assets that you got locked in? And what that 2019 interim period might look like as well?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, Julien, it's Tom. I think we may give a little bit of color, but as I said to Stephen, it's a little -- still early just given it is really hot off the presses. We have just been through a -- quite a lengthy competitor process. So it's a little early for us to be putting out detailed numbers.","Ahmed Pasha","Yes, Julien, just to give you a big picture. This is Ahmed. In terms of the uptick -- I mean, just comparing these current existing capacity against what we've just have been awarded, the 1,300, 1,400 megawatts. Just these megawatts will be contributing higher EBITDA earnings than what we are projecting today from existing capacity in 2017. On the top of that, there is another capacity, about 1,000 megawatts, that we have already permitted, that will add even more. So I think the short answer to your question is, it is accretive comparing the existing generation versus what we can do on our existing sites.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. Absolutely, very clear. And just in terms of capital allocation around the SCE assets. Can you just elaborate a little bit more what the thought process is around equity? And broadly funding it, if you will, just from a timeline perspective?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Sure. Once again, it's early, but I think if you take a $1.9 million, $2 billion number, we think these are very leverageable and consistent with our financing process. We do debt for certainly a strong majority, maybe call it 60% -- probably more likely 70%. So that will leave about 30% equity commitments. And we will -- as Andres said, we'll strongly look to bring in a partner that could help us leverage ourselves further and manage our commitments and also potentially enhance our return.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. Let me -- perhaps I may be a little clearer, also. What is your thought process around YieldCo selldowns? And just broadly speaking, your ownership of this versus perhaps, in someone else's hands who might value this at a different level?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","We've had a lot of discussions in the past about YieldCo. I'm saying we have nothing philosophically against them. We really haven't seen that we could at this stage of the game sort of carve out assets that would make sense because we -- lot of our PPAs in the U.S. and other markets are highly levered and have a lot of nonrecourse debt on them. So again, at this stage of the game, it's a little early. But again, we don't have anything philosophically against something like a YieldCo. And in fact, we have done, what we've done at Gener and what we've done at some of the other ones. But if you're saying sort of spin it off to somebody else for them to do YieldCo -- that's not sort of in the cards.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. All right. And then just -- let me just clarify little bit of what your response on prior question was. When you assume normal hydrology in 2015, that's a transition to normal hydrology, I imagine, right? And to the extent to which that it would be a transition, is there an incremental benefit as you think about this going from '15 to '16 or even '17, right? I mean, how much of a multiyear process is this in normalization?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","It's going to be a -- I mean, it's going to be a benefit. As you become normal -- I think what we mean by normal has to do -- within, let's say, one standard deviation in terms of getting it back on track and we really had sort of 2 outlier years. So I guess the -- if I understand your question, what we're saying is that we're not predicting a continuation of the sort of drought conditions and we're not using in our numbers any sort of rationing in the case of Brazil. And what we're seeing in Panama and Colombia is a return to, say, normal hydrology. I don't know, Tom, you want to add something?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes, I just say, Julien, in terms of transitioning into '16, we'll certainly -- once our contract, long-term contract, Eletropaulo, ends at the end of '15, we have the ability to manage our hydro risk through hedging ratios. So we've shown in the past we're kind of in the low 80s in terms of percentage of our shared energy that we have sold for '16. We'll certainly -- we may creep up somewhat, but we will be certainly at lower levels to provide ourselves the comfort that if there is poor hydrology in '16, we have set ourselves up so we don't have hydro risk.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And then lastly, could you elaborate a little bit on the legislative changes you need for the end of this year around the tax extenders?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","The CFC look-through rules -- I mean, those have -- in the past, they've been, say, renewed -- at sort of the 12th hour at the end of the year as part of larger packages. So everything that we're seeing is, we feel that it's very, very likely that they'll be extended this year once again, as part of an extender package at the end of the year. So as Tom said that -- because of this year, we -- the impact would be minimal. And in '15, there could be more of an impact, but we'll also take measures as we have in the past should it not be extended.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And I apologize if this is a naive question. Tipper [ph], CFC tipper [ph] -- is that all related? I know we used to talk about that, but just want to bring it up.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","The answer is yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Orrill of Barclays.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups or clarifications. On the look-through provision, just to clarify. Is that a new view that you've had as a result of some changes in Congress? Or was it your expectation all along that, that would be extended?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","No. I mean, this is not a change -- this has always been our view all along. I would like to emphasize that even in the unlikely case that we're not extended, this is not cash, as Tom mentioned. I mean, we have $3 billion of NOLs. So yes, this would affect our adjusted EPS, but not our cash.","Gregg Orrill - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then I think you commented that '17, '18, you've got some offsets that you put in place to help you. DPL, I think is one of them that you called out and -- so just curious as to what that is specifically.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Gregg, the DPL improvement would be a combination of darks as well as some value for the PJM premium capacity product. We're obviously watching that closely, still some moving parts in that, but we believe that if gets implemented in something near its current form that could be some good value for us also.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Chin of Merrill Lynch.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but on the California contracts, can you give a breakdown of that $1.9 billion between the CCGT and the energy storage assets?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I think, let us get back to you on that one.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","The vast bulk of it is in CCGT.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right. That's what I would have assumed, but just to get a little bit more color on that would be helpful. And if anything, I can follow-up with you at EEI.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","That's fine, Brian. We just want to make sure we're disclosing things that are consistent with the provisions of our bid process.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. Secondly, you mentioned in one of the earlier slides that Supreme Court of India decision on OPGC and the coal allocations. Could you just give a little bit more color on what exactly happened there and why did it happen the way it did?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Sure. Going back some time, I guess, about -- probably about 2 years ago, it started with an issue with the coal allocation, then there was a scandal in India called Coalgate. And really it was that people had received coal allocations and then flipped them for significant gains. So that, let's say, started the issue. We weren't, quite frankly, involved at all of this because we had received our allocation and our partner is the state government of Odisha. So we had our coal allocation and we were proceeding with the project. Then the Supreme Court did something that, which they had done in telecom spectrum, which was, really, to say that all prior allocations were invalid because the process was not, say, sufficiently transparent. And this was very politically successful in India. So really what they did was come out with a very similar decision regarding coal, basically saying that the coal allocation process was flawed and, therefore, the allocations were null and void. And this covered people from, who actually were currently operating plants, to people like ourselves who had future plans. It covered state governments. It covered JVs like us and it covered private companies. Then the decision actually came out that said, it did not apply to federal companies, but it includes state companies. Then subsequently, they came out with a decree saying that state government companies' allocations were also valid. So in our case, we're in sort of the gray zone because we're a JV and it's a state government of Odisha. So the good thing is we have been -- of this whole process, we've been extremely transparent and we think that the state government may get the coal allocation. From perspective of an investor in AES, even if we don't get the coal allocation -- we'd prefer it. It does help modestly on the returns and it helps us to assure the quality of the coal that we would be receiving. But even if it doesn't go forward, this is still a good project because this is located right next to OPGC I, and we have all the line permits for developing a -- and it's under construction, a 1,300 megawatt coal plant. So if it's a question of receiving coal from Coal India, as we currently do for the existing plant, again, it's still a good project. But we will of course prefer to have this -- more control over it with the coal allocation. So it's not a positive, but it's not something that, say, threatens the viability of the project.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess one follow-up question on this. With that decision causing a reallocation of coal, have coal prices in India been jumping up as different parties try to sign or renegotiate contracts?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","No. And it has not. Basically, what's happened is they have granted a temporary license to those who've had coal allocations that were operating and the rest were very much future projects. But I think people expect the coal to be used one way or another. So in essence, Odisha, our OPGC II project is pretty close to sort of a mine mouth type project. So it's very well situated. There's a shortage and we have a good contract for the offtake. So it's caused more noise, we think, than anything.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then one last question for me. I realize I've asked a few here. You guys gave out '15 and '16 guidance a quarter earlier than expected. And one of the factors that drove that decision was some of the volatility in macro factors. Could you give us a sense of how much you're hedged with regards to currency exposure in '15 and '16?","Thomas M. O'Flynn","Yes. We've got some sensitivities in the back, Brian, of our deck. But we generally hedge about 6 to 12 months forward in Brazil and about a year forward in other currencies. So, yes, some exposure in '15, a little the more in '16, but there's a page in the back of the deck.","Brian Chin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If you're referring to Slide 49, that's '15. How should we think about those sensitivities in '16? Maybe like 25%, 30% more sensitivity in '16?","Ahmed Pasha","No, I think -- Brian, this is Ahmed. I think you should look at it because that's why we provided it on open basis. So even if you assume it's all open, so it's $0.04 versus $0.035. So it's not as significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Angie Storozynski of Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","I had a bigger picture question. So you operate in the industry that is valued based on earnings. You have a very complex portfolio. Every time, there are factors you clearly cannot control and they're moving earnings around. Now the cash flow generation of your business is undeniable and you keep trading at a higher and higher cash flow. I mean, why not just use the cash that you are getting from asset divestitures and from your operating assets to buy back stock in very large quantities and thus, help the -- your share price? I mean, it's hard for me to believe that the investment of the cash that you're getting in any asset would actually render higher returns than actually buying back the stock.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","We have bought back, as we said, by the end of this year, close to $1 billion. And we think at a good price and we have sold down, I think, very well. I mean, if you actually look at our selldowns that we've done, our timing was very good in terms of when we disposed of the assets. So you raise a valid point, and we do look at that very closely. If you do -- our new projects do have ROEs that are higher than buying back our stocks. Now, there is a time inconsistency because the effect of buying back our stock today is much -- of course, is immediate versus having to invest 3 to 4 years. But we do look at that, Angie. And that's a very good question and we have to keep ourselves to that standard.","Angie Storozynski - Macquarie Research","Simply put, even if you really reinvest the money at the return that you're saying, and you really get to that eventual 8% growth in earnings, given the data that is associated with that growth, I don't think that you will ever be fully paid a high multiple for that growth, right? As opposed to the free cash flow yield that the stock currently generates and the cash that could be used to really significantly reduce the share count? I mean, it's -- I know that you're trying to maximize the shareholder value, but it's really hard to believe that a buyback at this level wouldn't be more value-creating than any investment at 15%-plus ROE.","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, we do look at it. We do sort of NPVs on this, but we can discuss that more off-line. I think it's a very good question that you raise and we do look at sort of the big pictures. And we know we will be generating more cash, faster cash growth for fundamental reasons. One is that we do have the NOLs and our tax rate has gone up from 2013 to today by 10 points. So that's a big jump. But it doesn't have any impact on us. The other one is Mong Duong and other -- some of our projects will be generating a lot more cash, but we have to even out the earnings, due to the accounting rules. But I would say that the -- what is important, and that's why we stressed it on this call. If you look at us, we've had significant jumps in our revenues and in our earnings. We have to have new assets come online because we have them contracted. And if you look at this year, 2014, we only have -- we have less than 300 megawatts coming online. If you look at next year, it's much, much higher. And you look at the next year. So when we talk about this growth, it is occurring from tangible projects that we have on hand. But thanks for the question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman of Morningstar.","Charles J.

Please note that this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Ahmed Pasha. Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, William. Good morning and welcome to our AES's second quarter 2016 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our second quarter 2016 financial review call. Today, I will discuss our year-to-date performance, provide an updates on market conditions and our progress on our strategic and financial objectives. Tom will then discuss our second quarter results and capital allocation in more detail. Before turning to results, I would like to highlight the most significant milestones that we achieved so far on our key objectives for 2016.","To continue de-risking our portfolio, we announce our close asset sales with proceeds of more than $500 million well above our target range of $200 million to $300 million. We brought online one-third of our capacity under construction, or 2.4 gigawatts on-time and on-budget. We prepaid $300 million in current debt exceeding our full-year target of $200 million, to accelerate our credit improvement. We are on-track to achieve our three-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals.","In Bulgaria, we receive payment of all outstanding receivables and continue to collect timely payment of invoices. And we continue to make progress to resolve DP&Ls pending rate case and our encouraged with recent regulatory developments in Ohio. I will discuss these achievements in more detail in the moment, but first, I would like to summarize our financial results on Slide 4.","Year-to-date, we generated proportional free cash flow of $670 million, representing 57% of our full-year guidance and reflecting the collection of outstanding receivables in Bulgaria during the second quarter. Our year-to-date adjusted EPS was $0.32 representing 32% of our full-year guidance, consistent with our comments on our last call. These results keeps us on-track to achieve our full-year financial guidance, which Tom will cover in detail.","Now I'll provide an update on macroeconomic conditions in our markets on Slide 5. First in Brazil, although we have seen a modest improvement in energy demand since our last call, we are still projecting negative growth for the year. In U.S. demand is essentially flat, but in most of our other markets, we continue to see robust growth in energy demand in the range of 4% to 10%.","Second while we have seen significant volatility in foreign exchange and commodity prices over the last couple of years, we are generally seeing market stabilize, as a result foreign exchange and commodity forward curves are largely in line with our expectation as of our last call. The one exception is that as a result of Brexit the British pound has depreciated by roughly 10%. However, we are largely here in the near-term and more importantly our exposure to the pound, is only about 3% of our pretax contribution.","Turning to Slide 6 on our portfolio optimization activities. In Brazil, we are seeing significant consolidation of the regulated utility sector at attractive valuations. We capitalize on this trend with the announced sale of our 100% ownership interest Sul, our most material utility business in Brazil from an investment point of view for approximately $470 million in equity proceeds to AES.","We are currently seeking regulatory approval for the transaction and expect to close before the end of the year. Including, the proceeds from the sale of Sul, we have announced our closed a total of $540 million in asset sales this year. Since September 2011, we have announced our closed asset sales with $3.8 billion in proceeds. The corner stone of our strategy in Brazil is [indiscernible] by perusing contracted wind and solar generation. Now that we are seeing the opportunity for reasonable inflation adjusted returns. These investments for help diversified [indiscernible] generation mix, while also allowing us to take advantage of the 300 million to 500 million in untapped debt capacity at [indiscernible].","Turning now to our platform expansion opportunities on Slide 7. Our ongoing construction program is the most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We are focusing on our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term U.S. dollar denominated contracts. One such opportunity is using our DR and future panama assets, to play a leading role and expanding the use of L&G throughout Central America and the Caribbean.","Regarding our construction projects, I\u2019m happy to report thus far this year we have commissioned 2.4 gig watts on-time and on-budget. The majority of this capacity is that Indianapolis Power and Light, our regulated utilities Indiana, where we will be earning predictable regulated returns on these investments. Later this year, we expect to complete our 5502 mega watt [7.20] plant in Chile, also on-time and on-budget.","We have another 3.9 gig watts of new capacity currently under construction and expect it to come online through 2019. To deliver sustainable growth beyond 2019 we continue to advance our development pipeline. To that end, we recently received approval for the 1.4 gig watts Southland repowering project from the California Utility Commission and we are on-track to receive final environmental permit, early in 2017 and expect to break ground at summer.","Turning now to Slide 8. Our 3.9 gigawatt currently under construction represent total capital expenditures of $7.8 billion. However, through a combination of non-recourse financing and equity partners, AESs equity commitment is limited to 1.3 billion of this all but 215 has been funded. Roughly 74% of our investments are in the Americas and of this a majority is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%.","The majority of our construction projects are conventional power plants such as the 670 megawatt Eagle Valley combined cycle gas fired plant at IPL. Additionally, as we have discussed in the past, we are also building the 530 megawatt Alto Maipo, one of the river hydro project in Chile. This project is our most complex, as we are excavating 67 kilometers of underground tunnels. One-third of which are already complete. The project is roughly six months behind its original schedule and we expect to complete the project in 2019.","Turning to Slide 9, and Colon project in Panama. We have made significant progress since our last call. As a reminder, the $1 billion Colon project will contribute to our growth beyond 2018 and includes, a 380 megawatt combined cycle gas plant and a 180,000 cubic meter LNG regasification and storage facility. The power plant is contracted under a ten year U.S. dollar denominated power purchase agreement, and our partner Grupo Motta, one of the largest financial and commercial groups in the country.","We recently achieved two important milestones at Colon. Closing the financing of 535 billion with the consortium of banks and initiating construction. The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our Andres LNG facility in the Dominican Republic. Andres provides gas to our adjacent power plant to another power plant via a gas pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sector.","Last month, Andres also delivered its first international shipment of LNG to Barbados. This is a great example of our facility\u2019s ability to serve as a reasonable gas hub by breaking large bulk shipments to serve smaller markets. There are many commercial and operational synergies between our LNG terminals in the Dominican Republic and Panama and with both facilities in operation, we will become the largest provider of the LNG regasification and storages services in Central America and the Caribbean.","Turning to Slide 10. We remain optimistic on the future of battery base energy storage, because we believe it will play a critical role in an increasingly renewable based generation mix. As you may know with our proprietary advancing system, we are the world leader in battery based energy storage with a 136 megawatts in operation across four countries, 13 megawatts under construction and 228 megawatts in advanced development including a 100 megawatts under our long-term contract.","We integrate [indiscernible] view in the energy storage space through two primary business models. First by developing and operating AES own project, such as the 20 megawatt Harding Street battery array we recently commissioned at IPL. As I just mentioned we currently have a 166 megawatts in operation or construction and another 220 megawatts in advance stage development.","Second by marketing and selling our Advancion Energy storage solution to other utilities commercial and industrial customers directly or through our sales channels partners, these sales require no investment capital and help advance to capture economies of scale. Thus far this year, we have sold 40 megawatt of Advancion systems third-parties, representing approximately $70 million in growth revenue.","Our second quarter results do not include these sales, but margins are on our initial sales will be modest, as we amortize start up cost. Although battery based energy storage is still it\u2019s early adoption cycle and we have not included any matured amount in our projection. We believe Advancion, presents an interesting opportunity for upside.","Turning to Slide 11, as a result of all the actions we are taking, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividend, continue deleveraging of the plant and subsidiary and investment in attractive platform expansions.","As you can see on Slide 12, we also see robust growth in the earnings to 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to 10% of expected growth is driven by the construction projects coming online in 2017 and 2018. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our second quarter results, capital allocation, and full-year guidance in more details.","Thomas O'Flynn","Thanks Andr\u00e9s. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our results including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow, and adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU, and I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation, as well as our guidance and expectations.","Turning to Slide 14, second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.17 was $0.09 lower than 2015. This decline is in line expectations communicated on our last call. Specifically, our second quarter results reflect $0.03 lower contributions from SBU, including anticipated drivers, such as timing of schedule maintenance in ANDES and MCAC.","A reduction of $0.03, because last year\u2019s results included the favorable impact of the reversal of a liability at Eletropaulo. And the $0.03 impact from the evaluation in foreign currencies as expected particularly in ANDES in Europe. Before moving on, I want to touch on a couple of large impairment charges we had this quarter that are not included in adjusted EPS.","First we impaired 235 million of assets at DPL, primarily at Kelin station, this impairment impacts our quarterly diluted EPS, and was larger driven by the results of the recent PJM capacity auction and our expectation of higher future environmental compliance cost under the EPA Effluent Limitation Guidelines in coal combustion with [indiscernible]. Second as you have seen in our 10-Q, as a results of the sale, we have included Sul in discontinued operation and an imperilment was recognized during the second quarter.","The remaining loss on sale will be recorded at the closing of the transaction. After taking into account previously recorded cumulative transaction adjustment. The net impact on as is equity will be a reduction of our 100 million. Given this business is in discontinued operations, these non-cash items do not affect either diluted or adjusted EPS. As a result of placing Sul, into Disc Ops, it\u2019s earnings and losses are removed from our 2016 and 2015 results. Consequently, our first quarter results have been restated to $0.15 after moving the $0.02 negative impact for Sul, which brings our year-to-date adjusted EPS for $0.32.","Now to Slide 15 and our overall results for the quarter. We generated 417 million of proportional free cash flow an increase of three 355 million from last year a significant of working capital improvements primarily at Maritza in Bulgaria offset lower margins. We also earned a 160 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of 100 million.","Now, I\u2019ll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on Slide 16. In the U.S., our results reflect relatively flat margins, as lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers; at DPL were largely offset by higher contributions at IPL. Including the benefit from the recent rate case and environmental upgrades they came online through this quarter. Also adjusted PTC was up modestly reflecting lower interest expense at DPL and IPL. Proportional free cash flow also reflects favorable working capital changes at IPL.","At ANDES, our results reflect the slightly higher margins due to higher spot and contract sales as well as lower maintenance at [indiscernible] in Chile. Partially offset by planned outages in Argentina as well as the devaluation of the Colombian and Argentine pesos. Proportional free cash flow also benefitted from higher collections in Argentina and at [indiscernible]. In Brazil our result reflect lower margins due to the benefit of a liability reversal at Eletropaulo in 2015. The exploration of Tiet\u00ea PPA at the end of 2015 and the 12% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Eletropaulo and Sul.","In Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect lower margins due to lower availability including a planned outage ion the Dominican Republic, where we were performing interconnection work in the preparation for the expansion of existing DPP gas fire facility. As you may recall for converting the simpler cycle DPP plant to combine cycle. Improving its capacity by 50% to 358 megawatts.","Construction on this project is progressing well. We have already completed 80% of the upgrade and it is expected to come online in the first half of 2017. Our quarterly results were also impacted by lower third party gas sales in the Dominican Republic. In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to 45% devaluation of the Kazakhstan Tenge. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the settlement of our 350 million outstanding receivable at Maritza in Bulgaria this quarter.","It\u2019s worth mentioning that we've seen greatly improved collections in the roughly three months since that settlement and payments occurring. As a direct results of recent energy sector reforms our off taker, NEK is now cash flow positive versus substantially negative in 2015. This improved financial condition also drove strong interest in the recent bond issuance by NEKs parent where they are able to raise more than \u20ac0.5 billion and attractive rates. Finally, in Asia, our results reflect steady margins and lower working capital requirements, at Mong Duong in Vietnam.","Now Slide 22, I\u2019ll provide an update on a regulatory filing at DP&L and Ohio. Under DP&L current ESP which cover the period from 2014 to 2016. DP&L has been collecting a service stability writer of little over 9 million per month. As you may know the Supreme Court of Ohio reverse the Utility Commission's approval of current ESP in late June. The court has since remanded the case to the commission, which now has jurisdiction.","Last week the DP&L filed to withdraw its current ESP and requested that the commission revert to the rates in effect prior to 2014, which would result in an in material financial impact of company. Matters now pending before the commission and we expect a ruling within a matter of weeks. At same time, we continue to progress on our filing for a new ESP. Which we expect to be effectively to begin in 2017. We expect an outcome that will supports the financial viability and credit profile of the business.","Now to Slide 23, and the progress we are making to improve our credit profile. We recently completed the refinancing of 500 million of our 2019 notes, extending the tender with 10 tenure notes. Additionally, since our last call, we have prepared a 180 million in parent debt. Bringing our total pay down year to date to 300 million, exceeding our 2016 debt reduction target by 50%. Since 2011 we reduced parent debt by 1.7 billion or 27% and reduced interest by on that 125 basis points, resulting in an annualize interest savings of 180 million. As you can see at the top of the slide, we now have no debt maturities maturing at the parent until 2019 when only 240 million is due.","In addition to the refinancing excluded to parent, we have also taken advantage of favorable market conditions and refinanced 1.4 billion in non-recourse debt primarily in Latin America. Through these proactive actions, we have been able to extend our maturities lower interest cost and reduced our exposure to floating rate interest. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, these proactive steps has helped us to reduce our parent leverage ratio from almost 6.5 times to slightly over 5 times debt to parent free cash ratio plus interest. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics. We believe this will help us reduced our cost of debt and enhance our equity valuation.","Now to our parent allocation on Slide 24. Sources on the left hand side, reflect 1.5 billion of total available discretion in cash, which includes 575 million of parent free cash flow. We continue to focus on maximizing cash to core and as a recent example, once with Macori administration looked at currency controls is in Argentina, we took a modest dividend of the first time since 2011.","We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of 525 million to 625 million, which is the foundation for our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation. Sources also include 540 million of proceeds from asset sales including approximately 470 million sales of Sul. As we expect to sell the close late in the year, the likely not deploy much as capital in 2016. We have however accelerated a portion of the expected proceeds by pre-paying a 180 million of parent debt in July that I just discussed.","No to uses on the right hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we showed during our last call. With 10% growth in our dividend and completed share repurchases we returned about one third of our allocated cash to shareholders this year. Going forward, we continue to see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. As just discussed we already prepaid 300 million in near term maturities.","We also allocated 360 million for investments in our subsidiaries and majority of which is for new projects driving our growth to 18 and beyond. After considering this investments in our subsidiaries, debt repayment and electronic dividend we are left with roughly 450 million of discretionary cash, which we will invest consistent with our capital allocation framework.","Finally, turning to Slide 25. We are reaffirming our 2016 guidance and 2017, 2018 expectations for all metrics with the foreign exchange and commodity fortress as of June 30. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow with our first half results reflecting the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza.","Our first half, adjusted EPS was in line with what we have indicated on our last call. As our results were impacted by higher tax rate planned outrages and softness in U.S. power prices. The majority of our earnings are expected to be generated in the second half of the year and we should benefit from a few factors putting lower schedule maintenance, a lower effective tax rate, the realization of cost savings initiative and a couple of other items we are working on.","With that, I'll now turn it back over to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks Tom. Before we take our question, let me summarize today's call. First we are executing on our priorities for 2016. Exiting certain businesses at attractive valuation completing 2.4 gigswatts of projects on-time and on-budget improving our credit profile and collecting on our outstanding receivables in Bulgaria.","Second we continue to invest our growing cash flow to reduce debt and in select gross projects as well as offer our investors a significant and growing dividends. Third, we remain confident in our ability to deliver strong free cash flow growth through 2018, which is driven by our projects under construction and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiatives.","Finally, we believe we are well positioned to deliver sustainable growth beyond 2018 due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing markets and our leadership position in deploying new technologies.","With that, I would like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","Thank you good morning. First question, can give us the sense of what gives you the confidence that the Ohio issue is particularly that's a correlation to the non-by passable are going to be resolved favorably and what are sort of the key milestones we should be looking at to figure out how this is playing out?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","We continue to have normal discussions consistent with the process in Ohio. We are obviously aware of developments with the other major utilities in the phase especially [Indiscernible] and they have got little bit different perspectives, but we think those are both constructive directions. We do continue to think that those strong support in the state for in state generations giving the fall of vertex diligent too far removed. The in state jobs in state revenue from taxes and those kind of things. So we think there is strong support for that and I apologize to say we are encourage by discussions as we said we re-filed our rates for the remainder of 2016 to go basically back to the pre 2014 structure and we think that there is constructive and consistent with the sentiments.","Ali Agha","And secondly as insulated to that Tom, so what is on that in to both your 2016, 2017, 2018 and outlook for this non by passable and I\u2019m assuming your attiring that continuing. And what if that doesn\u2019t happened, how should we think about the sensitivities with your earnings, whether it\u2019s for this year or for the growth in 2017, 2018 if that goes away?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","I think what we would say is, I think we have been consistent here, number one our most recent filing would not have material impact, assume we go back to the 2013 rate structure, we would not have material impact on our financials for the reminder of 20`6. Going forward, as we discussions this different approaches here, but we generally baked into our guidance is less than what we are currently getting, which is about a 110 million a year or 9 million a month, but it\u2019s still material amount. We haven\u2019t put a fine point on that but certainly it would be meaningful impact if there are a large fall but at this point we believe we will get something in that range.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Remember also Ali, we\u2019ve not taken a dividend out of DPL, for some time and there is no parent free cash flow from DPL at least till 2018 in our forecast.","Ali Agha","Okay, understood. Separately Andr\u00e9s when you look at your portfolio today, can you just highlight for us, what regions or assets in general would you consider to be non-core to this portfolio as you continue going down the road of streamlining your platform?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay, we have, I think on very well in terms of focusing this company, in terms of getting out of those regions were we didn\u2019t see those markets was so attractive and realizing attractive valuation from those sales. So what we are focused on in terms of growth, it\u2019s going to be those places we can get, long term ideally dollars denominated contracts and were we can bring something besides just money. So these are additions where there are synergies or economics have scale.","So we don\u2019t like talking about exactly those places that we are going to get out of until we do it. And you know we have very much stuck to that rule over the years. But I would say those countries, where we don\u2019t see those opportunities. Where we see that, today quite frankly they are either too volatile or we don\u2019t see opportunities for growth. So what I would like to say, we will continue to grow those businesses, especially those that are cash accretive and our real focus is on creating a company where we have a strong sustainable growth in our dividend and that\u2019s what we are focused on.","So I\u2019m not going to get into it specifically, but I think if you do it by the process to elimination which is those places where we don\u2019t see growth, where we don\u2019t see long-term contracts and we really don\u2019t have any really sort of particularly advantages position we will get out of. Now we won\u2019t talk about them, until it\u2019s actually done, because obviously those can affect our operations.","Ali Agha","Last question, Tom just remind us, why don\u2019t you, you\u2019re not allocated specially cash in terms of your priority of the use of that cash and you just remind us what your priority would be on ranking your priorities?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, I think will across all the [indiscernible] side I think we will look at incremental growth and I think we have said that we would expect about 300 million to 400 million of contributions into our businesses from core on a normal year. This year we are kind of right in middle of that point. Of course continuing to grow the dividend on a regular basis, we will continue to look to deleverage and may take some of this opportunity to accelerate the deleveraging in our balance sheet. And of course stock repurchases is still something we have authority for, we have done a lot. So as we said, I think our primary focus in terms of cash to shareholders would be by the dividend.","Ali Agha","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Julien Dumoulin Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So, perhaps a few more specific questions on the [Indiscernible] process here just being very clear. How to think about the ESP-1 rate structure for 2013. What I understand it's mostly a regulated structure with fuel pass through how should be think about power prices and just competitive retailers under that rate structure. I know it's a bit detailed, but I'm just to be curious so it is are you still positively exposed to stock prices increasing net-net. I'm just trying to understand how that the supplier recovery gets done and then secondly can you talks you the ESP-3 filing that you have pending are you been to need the re-filing of that or are you been amended to reflect some of the changes that might be necessary out of the Ohio Supreme Court.","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, Julien let me try to tackle that. In terms of number one the market risk and reward that we have is under our restructure and one that we had it or one that we are not going to revert back to is really the gen, is really at our generation that - basis of risking rewards of the market. In terms of structure of going back to, its different kind of financially at the end of day, it's about the same for us, but there was a group of people that have they not chopped then they would go to a defined rate structure. And that kind of slices it up a little bit different way, but the utility is not exposed to that it's a little bit different way to slice up the same amounts.","In terms of going forward, we believe that what we had filed earlier in January and February, we can work under that umbrella, if you will. So we don\u2019t need to pull that back and re-file. Remember we had a couple of different alternatives and so we feel that that umbrella gives us the flexibility to shape a solution in different ways.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it and just to be clear. The ESP-1 the 2013 rate structure will remain indefinitely until you got a rate outcome under the ESP-3 structure. So kind of agnostic perhaps too strong award there, but throughout the process whenever you eventually get an outcome in ESP-3 just to be clear.","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, it would remain outstanding until those a supplement for it. And both of them are supportive of our financial structure.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Go it, excellent. And then jus the quick one and following up on the last question as well. Brazil Eletropaulo, can you comment just on what your thought process is there, obviously there has been some media comments there. How do you think about Brazil both on the [indiscernible] and the Eletropaulo by prospectively in the [indiscernible] region and how would you execute the your going into?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Okay, first given that Eletropaulo is a publicly listed company, we don\u2019t comment on it. I think what we have said is that, we made a significant strategic move by existing Sul. If you look at today\u2019s market price the equity value we had at Sul is more than [indiscernible] the value that we have in the Eletropaulo, so we have made a significant shift. Second, we have been very disciplined in Brazil, specially at [indiscernible]. We always for many years had this leverage capacity and the ability to buy new assets to grow. But we didn\u2019t really see the valuations. We really didn\u2019t see valuations that we are attracted for us.","With the correction in prices in Brazil, we are starting to see opportunity that would make it more attractive to leverage up [indiscernible] and buy something in Brazil. Now what would we buy? Well as we said in the past, we are really looking at our sort of risks, and we wouldn\u2019t want more hydro risk in Brazil, so ideally it would be something like sola or wind or perhaps even thermal that would not be correlated to hydrology in Brazil to make our cash flow from [indiscernible] more steady. So again, Eletropaulo being a publicly listed company, it would be process pertinent to that market, but we are going to comment on it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Sorry and then the last quick one, any update on the assets the you impaired in DPL, just curious if that has any reflection on the future viability of them in terms of retirement or whether they clearly [indiscernible].","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","No that was just at Kelin and that was just because it had a higher carrying value it was reflecting the result of the latest capacity auction.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","They are all cleared Julian, all our [indiscernible] is cleared.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi good morning. Just wanted to check in with you on the storage business, there is increasingly talk about the business and you all obviously are very early into this business, when you think about growth potentials, we are seeing reports that costs are coming down for the actually equipment. Do you see that there are sort of inflections point at which it does become a fairly large driver of spending or is it a more gradual thing, where there is ultimately a step change, buts it\u2019s rather just a gradual increase as you go down the curve. In other words, do you see relatively significant changes within, a year or two or three in terms of where the cost is going that going to allow the businesses to scale up a lot or do you thinks it\u2019s probably more gradual pace?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","What we are seeing in the business, is continued reduction in cost. So if we look at the cost of batteries they have come down 80% in the last five year and we are projecting an additional 50% in the next five. So that would driven them down significantly and really this is not technological breakthrough, it is as much as just really massification of the production process. So the more people that bring online giga factories and drive down battery prices, the batter it will be for people such as ourselves.","Now, given that how do you see this market, well this market is growing one of the main let's say things that are slowing it down it regulatory, since these batteries operate differently than just regulatory say [peeking] plans where other people providing ancillary services, because for example it goes positive and it goes negative. But having said that we are seeing this market that was a couple of 100 megawatts last year this it's growing some of the forecast by 2020 could be 10 gigawatts globally.","The forecast the lower as forecast you will see it's probably around 6 gigawatts that's still a tremendous rate of growth. Now that there are many applications, there is little bit of the hammer and so you can use it for many different things from load shifting ancillary services capacity release transmission constraint.","So that's how we see this market, now I see it kind of growing quickly some markets quicker than others the U.S. is clearly leading great the UK is having an important auction now, we see interesting markets in India with their expansion of renewable. So basically as I said in my speech as you have more renewable on the grid interruptible renewable the greater the need for these batteries, and there are different forms to alleviate that.","So we are pursuing it by two means one is on our own platform, we are participating in some of these auctions when they are big enough we do bring in partners like we do on all large projects, but we are also pursuing through some direct sales, but also through sales channel partners global sales. And we have already have had some success with $70 million so far this year. We expect that to grow over the remainder of the year and into next and of course that has overtime will have an interesting margin. But right now one of the things it does it helps to drive down cost, because this is all about scale. So if are one of the largest suppliers to the market I think you will have across advantage.","Stephen Byrd","That's very helpful color, Andr\u00e9s. And you had mentioned in your prepared remarks about essentially amortizing some of these initial cost. Could you remind us just sort of how rapidly you think you would be able to kind of [indiscernible] through those cost so that we can start to see significant margins on incremental sales.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Look it's going to depend on - this is volume. So basically think of startup cost and things like that are fixed cost, the more you have the more quickly we are not really prepared to sort of give guidance on the third-party sale, but I really don\u2019t see this certainly not this year and probably next is not being a meaningful contributor.","Stephen Byrd","Thank you. I'm sorry?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","And the finally this is not in our guidance for that reason, but this could become quite interesting outside that time horizon.","Stephen Byrd","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Lasan Johong from Auvila Research Consulting. Please go ahead.","Lasan Johong","Good morning thank you. Tom, I have a quick question on the 15% rate of return should we expect the hurdle rate to go up as interest rates go up and your cost of capital go up with it?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, I think the short answer is generally interest rates are being coming down and our cost of capital I think has been coming down so I think that's a good number certainly on the projects we are doing. To the extent that I think Andr\u00e9s mentioned much of our focus will be on long-term U.S. contracted business some of that may warrant some compression of that modestly, but I don\u2019t think we see them going up.","Lasan Johong","My point eventually the interest rate are going to go up at some point, right whether it\u2019s a year or two years from now. When that happens, are we going to see is that 15% hurdle rate go up?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes the one thing I would say is we certainly look at our cost of capital IRRs on a real time basis, real time for global interest rates, local interest rates, local risk. So certainly if there is a meaningful change in macro conditions, be it interest rate risk or other things inflation what have you. We would certainly factor that into that into our capital allocation framework.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Lasan I think, one way to look at this is, we want to earn a 200 basis points plus over our sort of weighted cost capital on this projects. So it\u2019s going to depend on their locations. So for example, you are really, we will have a lower ROI for those projects that are rate based on our regular utilities Than we do on some of the other projects which are one different locations. But the one thing we are moving towards, I would say, de-risking the company.","And so that I think it\u2019s an important component and I so it\u2019s dollar denominate long term contract, in the good zip code and that\u2019s a great country. Those will have a lower return than some of the other locations. But I do think that when you look at our projects, what is important is there is a lot of synergies between them. So if we look at for example the Panama project, it will have significant synergies if we increase the amount of tolling we do from that facility, you know our power plant will take roughly about 30% of the capacity to tank in the terminal.","So we are really looking for a third-party sales, like we do in the Dominican Republic. So once you have the two hubs operating the return from the project will not only be from the project itself, will also be from the existing businesses. So that\u2019s how we are looking at it. and just to say, so I don\u2019t think that if interest rates go up, it depends, how much they go up, but we are also shifting our business to less risky businesses and the returns of the project is also returns to the bits to existing businesses, which perhaps were not included in that ROE.","Lasan Johong","No let me flip the question around. How much more businesses you usually get if you drop the hurdle rate to 12% or 10% even?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","I think if we drop the hurdle rate, again we don\u2019t have a universal hurdle rate. The lower the cost of [Technical Difficulty] projects in some other markets [Technical Difficulty] we don\u2019t use the universal hurdle rate.","Lasan Johong","Okay. Thank you very much for your help.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","Brian Russo","Hi good morning. Just curious are there any issues or risk to the Sul approval process, I believe that these acquires, shareholder approval, just may be some comment on the milestones there to get approved?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes the milestone and they have a shareholders\u2019 approval. We believe that they are very confident of getting it. Then there would be an approval of [indiscernible] which is the regulator. And that\u2019s why we are targeting this close for the fourth quarter of this year, but given all that\u2019s happening in Brazil, we don\u2019t expect any issue. And furthermore, it\u2019s a acquisition that makes a lot of sense, which is consolidating the distribution company into state of real grounded to Sul. So there is lot of logic, a lot of cost savings from bringing these together. So we think the fundamentals for the transaction for the acquirer are very strong.","Brian Russo","Okay, thanks. And then just on the TPO, Ohio process. I'm just curious what was the thought process to file to revert back to the pre 2014 rate structure. I mean did you have discussions with staff or what made you choose that route versus any of the other alternatives.","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, I mean we did have some consultation, I better not go into the specifics, but following the Supreme Court we wanted to look for something that had the same provision of stability and supporting the overall financial viability of the company, but staying away from let's say the specifics of the Supreme Court. But also appreciating that there was strong motivation for the reason that I mentioned earlier to keep the utility stable and keep our generation viable.","Brian Russo","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes is from Brian Chin with Bank of America ML. Please go ahead.","Brian Chin","Hi good morning. I have got a question on the effluent requirement and the coal combustion residual requirements. How much extra CapEx is that going to necessitate?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Yes, we haven\u2019t disclose that specifically. I believe DPL has the three-year forward CapEx table that is in their K. We are still reviewing it, but we did have some preliminary number let's say that were baked into our impairment analysis and it was really the combination of those numbers. They really be out - I believe it\u2019s a 20 to 21 times zone as well as we did have to take note of the recent capacity auction that was down much from 160 to about 100 and that we think a 100s low, we did have to factor that most recent data point into our long-term forecast.","Brian Chin","Okay, so just to be clear that CapEx spending would be done in 2021 or there is a deadline for the plants to meet the requirements by 2021?","Ahmed Pasha","Brain this is Ahmed. This is [Indiscernible] 2022 and as Tom mentioned I mean we did have a number in our forecast, but based on the revised forecast the projections are slightly higher, but real impact for this impairment is the capacity prices, which came in lower than what we were expecting. So that was the bigger driver than the CapEx.","Brian Chin","Got you. And then just going back to your prepared comments on Sul. You mentioned that you had re-classed Sul into discontinued operation and there was a $0.02 sort of swing on year-to-date to adjusted EPS. I'm just assuming that you haven\u2019t change guidance, because $0.02 is relatively minor or immaterial versus the guidance range is that right?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","That's fair and to be honest when we talked last time we did say - when we had a slower first quarter we did say there were some things that we are working on and this is at least one of the thing in the bucket.","Brian Chin","Got you. Great, thank you very much that\u2019s all I got.","Operator","Our next question is from Charles Fishman with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Charles Fishman","Thank you. Andr\u00e9s [indiscernible] discuss the slide. Slide 12, on the third bar. In the 8% to 10% new construction that I get and you have laid that out very well. The 5% from existing business, I wonder if Andr\u00e9s you or Tom could may be give a little more color on that. is that like just a full-year of IPL for instance, improving Brazil or what plays into the 5% over the two years?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That is our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative, which is well under way. We have a three year $150 million cost saving new enhancement initiatives in three chunks of 50-50 and 50. This is an annual run rate, prior to this in the previous four years we did a $200 million cost savings and revenue initiative. So we have a lot of experience at this. Perhaps Bernerd our Chief Operating Office can make a few comments on what that consist of.","Bernerd Da Santos","Yes thanks Andr\u00e9s, I think we are very pleased that we are on-track with the $50 million that was what we commit for the first year in 2016 and we also have a - we thought the initiative that we have underway well tracking on into [indiscernible] and the $250 million for 2017 and 2018. And just as to reminder a those are the initiatives that we were disclosing our synergies and economics has scales that is one with the pocket that we are working in sourcing.","And the service centers that we have in lower cost location and what they can [indiscernible] between the labor cost that we have and deficiencies of standardization that we have in those places and the standardization [indiscernible] improvement that we are doing in our fleet. [indiscernible] sharing or replication of the lead practice of our thermal plants. A best performance thermal plants across the rest of the fleet. So with that, we actually have identified largely he $150 million that need to be delivered and we are very confident to deliver those.","Charles Fishman","Okay so lot of 5% is these cost savings, pretty well, we can count on that sound pretty - you can bank that. That\u2019s good. Okay, that was all I had. Thank you very much.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ahmed Pasha for any closing remarks.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you everybody for joining us in today\u2019s call.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Brendon. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2018 financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; Gustavo Pimenta, Deputy Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, I will turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Good morning everyone and thank you for joining our third quarter 2018 financial review call. We had a strong quarter demonstrated by solid financial results and excellent progress towards achieving our strategic goals. We continue to improve the returns from our existing portfolio and position AES for long-term sustainable growth.","Our third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.35 puts us at $0.88 for the first nine months of 2018 which is 35% higher than the $0.65 we earned in the same period last year. We remain on-track to achieve our 2018 guidance and longer term expectations. Tom will discuss our results in more detail after I provide a review of our strategic accomplishments. I will structure my remarks today around four overall themes; first, optimizing our returns; second, our growing backlog of renewable projects; third, advancing our LNG strategy; and finally, deploying new technologies. I have discussed these themes in the past, and on this call I will provide concrete examples of how we're delivering on each in support of our overall strategy.","Beginning on Slide 4 with optimizing our returns. We have been reshaping our portfolio to deliver attractive returns to our shareholders while reducing our overall risk and carbon footprint. As can be seen on the slide, our renewable investments are projected to produce low-to-high teen IRRs across all markets assuming conservative terminal values. Specifically, as you may recall, we bought sPower in 2017 at a high single-digit return; since then we have taken steps to enhance that return including refinancings and operational improvements. This morning we announced that we have agreed to sell 24% of sPower's operating portfolio to Ullico. As a result of all of these actions we have improved our expected return on sPower's operating portfolio to around 13%, and we will use the proceeds to help fund new solar and wind projects in the U.S.","Now turning to our backlog of renewable projects beginning on Slide 5. Our robust pipeline continues to increase driven by our focus on select markets where we can take advantage of our global scale and synergies with our existing businesses. So far this year we have signed 1.9 gigawatts of long-term PPAs for renewable projects or 93% of our internal projection of 2 gigawatts for full year 2018. We are on pace to sign 2 to 3 gigawatts of new PPAs annually for 2019 and 2020. We expect this capacity to be split 50-50 between the U.S. and internationally, and similarly, between solar and wind. By the end of 2020 we expect to have signed 7.5 gigawatts of new renewable PPAs all of which will be online by 2022. To complement our strategy to invest in attractive renewable projects and expand our environmental, social and governance related disclosures; next week we will be releasing a climate scenario report that complies with the guidelines of the task force on climate related financial disclosures and includes updated carbon intensity reduction targets that reflect our renewable growth.","Now onto Slide 6 and how we are capitalizing on our existing footprint. As you may recall, on our last call we introduced our green blend and extend strategy. With this win-win strategy we leverage our existing platforms, contracts and relationships to negotiate new long-term PPAs with higher returns than we would otherwise get through a bidding process. We see potential opportunities to execute on this strategy across many of our markets including Chile, Mexico and United States. In the near-term we see an addressable universe of 7 gigawatts across our portfolio which could substantially increase as other markets capitalize on the economic benefits of renewables.","Turning to Slide 7; we have signed two green blend and extend contracts for a total of 576 megawatts in Chile and Mexico. The contract in Chile was the first of it's kind; we signed an 18-year contract with an existing customer for 1,100 gigawatt hours of annual delivery [ph] which is equivalent to 270 megawatts of renewable capacity. This will lengthen AES Gener's average contract life to 11 years, replace 5% of AES Gener's total load, and 40% of the thermal PPAs expiring in 2022. We are also implementing a similar contract in Mexico with our off-taker Penoles. To help Penoles gradually replace pet-coke with greener, efficient renewable energy, we negotiated a 25-year PPA to build the 306 megawatt Mesa La Paz wind project leveraging our strong existing customer relationship and our global renewables capabilities. This will increase our average contract life with Penoles from 8 years to 17 years.","In summary, we are very encouraged by our progress to-date on the green blend and extend concept, and we are well positioned to take advantage of this significant opportunity.","Turning to Slide 8; since our last call we've made good progress on the 3.9 gigawatts of projects under construction. Currently 80% consists of large conventional projects which are significantly more capital intensive and complex, and have longer lead times. Our conventional generation projects under construction are progressing well and the majority of the capacity will be completed by the end of next year. I will now review some of these construction projects on the following slides beginning on Slide 9.","Construction on our 1.3 gigawatts Southland [ph] combined cycle plant in Southern California is proceeding as planned, on-time and on-budget; and we are now well over halfway complete. All six turbines and generators are in place and the focus is now on the installation of piping and electrical components. The project is expected to be operational by the first half of 2020. OPGC2 in India and Alto Maipo in Chile are both advancing as planned. OPGC 2 is 97.5% complete and is expected to come online later this year. Alto Maipo is 70% complete with the tunneling work 61% complete, and is expected to come online in the second half of 2020.","The remaining 20% of our projects under construction are solar, wind and energy storage which compared to construction of conventional generation are generally much less complex. As I previously discussed, the vast majority of our future construction will be renewables. Currently our 776 megawatts of renewable construction projects are expected to come online through 2020. In Hawaii, we're delivering two solar plus storage facilities for a total of 47 megawatts of solar and 170 megawatt hours of 5-hour energy storage on the island of Hawaii [ph]. These pioneering projects will serve base load energy needs including satisfying 24\/7 demand with renewable power. The first of these projects is under construction and the second for the U.S. Navy is expected to begin construction later this year. Once both of these projects are complete, they will represent the largest solar plus storage installation in the world.","Furthermore, we were recently awarded two additional projects with 90 megawatts of solar plus 360 megawatt hours of energy storage, also in Hawaii. We are currently finalizing the PPAs for these projects and will provide additional details once the contracts are signed.","To summarize, as shown on Slide 12, we expect at 11.3 gigawatts of new capacity through 2022. This includes our 5.7 gigawatt backlog, as well as 5.6 gigawatts of additional renewable PPAs we expect to sign through 2020. These projects will be key contributors to our growth through 2020 and beyond.","Turning now to our LNG strategy on Slide 13. As you may know, we have 2 LNG regasification terminals in Central America and the Caribbean with a total of 150 tera Btus of LNG storage capacity. These terminals were built to supply not only the gas for our co-located combined cycle plants but also to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the region. This excess capacity provides us with significant upside potential as the fixed cost of the terminals are covered by our captive requirements. We are making good progress on the commercialization of this capacity, in fact, this year we have signed three contracts yielding $35 million in additional annual margin to AES beginning in 2021. With the sales we will monetize much of our excess capacity in the Dominican Republic. However, we have options for further expansion in the Dominican Republic as needed.","In Panama, the storage tank at our recently inaugurated Colon power plant and regasification terminal will come online in mid-2019, and approximately 60% of the terminals capacity is still available. This represents an additional potential margin of more than $60 million annually for Colon. Together with our strategic partners total, we are already making progress on selling natural gas to third-parties in Panama. The expertise we have gained in the Dominican Republic and Panama has positioned us well in Vietnam where we have signed an MOU to build a similar LNG regasification and storage facility. This facility would have an annual storage capacity of 300 tera Btus and provide much needed natural gas to serve a rapidly growing market. Although in the early stages we will provide updates as this project progresses.","Now onto new technologies on Slide 14. We are a leader in deploying new technologies such as battery-based energy storage, drone applications and digital customer interfaces. These initiatives have already allowed us to reduce O&M costs, improve customer experiences and deliver innovative solutions to the market. As one example, we are already saving $10 million annually through drone applications alone. By expanding our use of digital technologies, we expect to further reduce O&M and back-office costs by an additional tens of millions of dollars. Year-to-date, Fluence, our energy storage joint venture with Siemens, has been awarded more than 250 megawatts of new projects. Fluence has now delivered or been awarded 75 projects in 16 countries with a total capacity of 701 megawatts.","Furthermore, as you might have seen, last month we pointed Sanjeev Addala for the newly created position of Chief Information Digital Officer. Sanjeev comes from GE Renewable Energy where he served as Chief Digital Officer. We've already done a lot of work to prepare for digitalization, including the strategic investment in Simple Energy earlier this year. Simple Energy is the leading provider of utility branded online energy efficiency marketplaces and customer engagement software in the U.S.","Finally after 6 years as CFO, Tom will be stepping into a new role to help us secure greater amounts of third-party financing through innovative means. Tom has played a key role in our growth in U.S. renewables, and considering the size of our pipeline and the importance of sourcing capital effectively, I have asked him to take on this new role. We plan to address this effort in more detail when it's further along but would note that we view it as the next step in our partnership strategy which has already raised approximately $3 billion and proved returns on our invested capital.","Tom will be succeeded by Gustavo Pimenta, who many of you have met over the years; for the past nine months he has served as Deputy CFO, and before that as CFO of several of our Latin American operations, including the publicly-listed companies of Eletropaulo and AES Tiet\u00ea [ph] in Brazil.","The financial discipline and rigor that Tom and I have embedded in our capital allocation framework will of course continue unabated with this transition.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tom to discuss our financial results, capital allocation, guidance and expectations in more detail.","Tom O'Flynn","Thank you, Andr\u00e9s. The past 6 years as CFO have been rewarding time and I'm truly proud of the Company's transformation. The business is significantly derisked and on an attractive growth path. I'm also pleased that I've helped lead our growth in renewables and I look forward to my new challenge where I will be focused on raising third-party capital to systematically and cost effectively help finance this growth.","Now I'd like to cover our third quarter results, improving credit profile and capital allocation. As shown on Slide 16, EPS was $0.35 for the quarter reflecting higher contributions from South America and U.S. in utilities, a lower quarterly tax rate and debt paid down [indiscernible]. Offsetting these were the sales of our coal plants in the Philippines and Kazakhstan.","Turning to Slide 17; adjusted PTC during the quarter was $327 million, an increase of $89 million. I'll cover our results in more detail over the next four slides beginning on Slide 18.","In the U.S. utilities SBU higher PTC was primarily driven by our generation of [indiscernible] which came in from a long-term agreement in May. Since then AES has benefited from the facilities location by selling energy in the constrained region of the California market. These plants are being repowered under a long-term contract starting in 2020. Regarding our regulated utilities, the Indiana commission concluded IPLs rate case last week, the ruling was consistent with the prior settlement agreement, and also our expectations. This constructive outcome together with DPLs rate case in September leave our U.S. utilities well positioned for the future rate based investment in T&D infrastructure. IPL has grown it's rate base considerably over the last few years and looking forward, there is still potential for growth in the mid-single digits.","At DPL where the focus has been on restructuring the business, we could see growth in the high single digits. The captured portion of this potential growth DPL will be filing it's smart grid investment plan by year end. In South America, PTC improved on the strength of record high quarterly results at AES Gener driven by higher contracted sales, prior year plant outage and lower interest expense. Our results also reflect higher contract price in Colombia, as well as higher tariffs in Argentina following the 2017 reset. In MCAC, lower PTC was largely driven by an event at our Andres [ph] plant in the Dominican Republic. In early September, a lightning strike caused major damage to the plant forcing offline for about three weeks. The local team has performed admirably and we expect to get the plant back up to roughly 75% load within the week. Further measures are underway to return the plant to full capacity by the first quarter.","Including reserves for property damage taken in our captive insurance business, the total impact of the third quarter was about $0.03 which backed this to be the bulk of the overall impact and the plant is fully insured. Filing new raiser [ph], our results primarily reflect the sale of our businesses in the Philippines and Kazakhstan. Based in part and our strong year-to-date results we are reaffirming our guidance for 2018. Relative to fourth quarter 2017, this year's fourth quarter will be impacted by a higher expected tax rate compared to only 18% last year, as well as an unplanned outage at our Warrior Run plant that have just been completed. Regardless, we feel very confident with our guidance for the year.","Turning to our improving credit profile beginning on Slide 22; the third quarter of '16 we established a goal of rich investment grade. At that time we had $5 billion parent debt and a debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio of 4.9 times. Since then we've reduced debt by almost $1.2 billion, and we expect to end this year with a ratio of 4.3 times. Our goal is to achieve investment grade metrics of below 4 times next year which positions us well to achieve an investment grade rating by 2020.","As shown on Slide 23, we're now rated BB plus by all three agencies, just one notch for investment grade. We believe these credit improvements are helping us not only to reduce our cost and debt and improve our financial flexibility but also to enhance our equity valuation.","Now the 2018 parent capital allocation of Slide 24. Beginning on the left hand side, sources reflect $2 billion of total available discretionary cash, including $600 million to $675 million of parent free cash flow. Sources also reflect $1.3 billion in net asset sale proceeds which includes close sales in the Philippines and Brazil in the recently announced sell-down of sPower's operating portfolio. Another use is on the right hand side; including the 8.3% dividend increase we announced in December will be returning $345 million to shareholders this year. We've used over a $1 billion to reduce parent debt including revolver drawings, and we plan to invest $300 million in our subsidiaries, primarily for projects under construction leaving about $100 million of unallocated cash.","Finally, moving to our capital allocation from 2018 through 2020 beginning on Slide 25. We continue to expect our portfolio to generate $4.2 billion discretionary cash which is more than 40% of our current market cap. About half of our discretionary cash is expected to be generated from parent free cash flow, the rest comes from our $2 billion asset sale target, $1.3 billion of which is completed or announced.","Now to the uses of this discretionary cash on Slide 26. A quarter of this cash has been allocated to the current dividend of $0.52 per share. As you know, our annualized dividend growth rate has been 9% for the last three years. Looking forward, we expect the dividend to grow in line with the industry average and remain important part of our value proposition. We review our dividend annually worth our Board in December. Back to the slide, $1.7 billion is allocated to debt reduction, 70% which is completed. We're also planning to fund $950 million of our equity investments in our backlog in projected PPAs. Once completed all these projects will contribute to our growth through 2020 and beyond. Remaining $600 million of unallocated cash which is largely weighted to 2019 and 2020 is available to create additional shareholder value including investment and subsidiaries and dividend growth.","With that, I'll now turn it back to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks, Tom. Before we take your questions, let me summarize today's call. We are delivering on all of our financial and strategic objectives. We have grown our backlog of projects to 5.7 gigawatts of which 1.9 gigawatts are long-term renewable contracts signed this year. We are successfully commercializing our excess LNG storage capacity. We are on-track to achieve investment grade metrics by 2019 and ratings by 2020. Our portfolio will be generating $4.2 billion in discretionary cash from 2018 through 2020 which we will redeploy consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework.","Finally, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2018 guidance and our 8% to 10% average annual growth in adjusted EPS and parent free cash flow through 2020.","Operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ali Agha with SunTrust.","Ali Agha","Now that we have nine months of the year behind us, just one quarter to go, and given the kind of year-over-year growth you've already reported through the nine months; is it fair to say the higher tax rate notwithstanding that we are probably trending right now above the midpoint of the full year guidance because you should have the $0.10 band and we only have one quarter to go, just wondering if you could narrow that down a bit given that nine months is already behind us?","Tom O'Flynn ","As usual, I think we'd prefer to stay away from range within the range. I think we're very comfortable with the range. As I pointed out, remember the businesses are performing well. We've had a couple of headwinds, the most notable of which is the DR that we've recovered well in that, and that's only $0.03. I did point out the unusually low tax rate in Q4 of last year, so on a year-over-year basis that will normalize but I think it's better just to leave it there, we're very comfortable with our range.","Ali Agha","And then my second question; the 24% sell down at sPower, can you also tell us how much net income goes away with that sell down? And related with that Tom, as part of your new role; is that the kind of activity we should see going forward as you're funding your renewable growth that -- as projects come online likely sell down the minority stake and then refund; I mean, is that the philosophy here?","Tom O'Flynn ","In terms of the net income that goes away, I think it's a modest amount and it was still looking forward with our trajectory obviously for '18 and another 8% to 10% still 2020. In terms of my new role, it's -- over the last few years we've certainly have worked on partnerships, as Andr\u00e9s said of over $3 billion; that is the type of investor and the type of transaction that we'd like to do on a more systematic basis. Provided doing it one-by-one we'd like to think about doing it with a variety of investors and with capital that could be available with good foresight let's say.","Ali Agha","Andr\u00e9s, as you look at slightly longer term outlook for the company, what is the visibility that you're seeing right now to sustain your growth rate beyond 2020? As you mentioned, the larger projects are going to be less important but renewables are going to pick up; so what's your line of sight or visibility for your growth rate as we look beyond 2020?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We feel very good about our longer term growth prospects. As you know, a number of our projects are coming online in 2020 -- between now and 2020. So for example, Southland [ph] being a notable case. We also have a lot of renewables projects that will be coming online. So we feel good about it, we feel that the green blend and extend, for example, in the case of AES Gener is extending those contracts. And so we see that we will continue to grow well and we will provide more guidance in the fourth quarter -- on our fourth quarter call we will provide a longer term guidance. But as we've been saying for some time, we expect a continued good growth past 2020.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Actually, maybe let me kick it off right there. Tom, we'd love to hear a little bit more about the innovative capital raising effort that you're heading off here to lead. I mean obviously, you all have spearheaded a lot of perhaps less than intuitive opportunities to sell down in different ways; what is this latest effort -- how different is the latest effort from the minority sales that you've done traditionally?","Tom O'Flynn ","I think it's systematically quite consistent. As Andres said, I think it's really the next step for the company and also, obviously another step, another challenge for me. But we've done a large number of partnerships, some were strategic but a number of them have been with large financials. And we want to capitalize on that and as I said do it in a more systematic basis and also have capital more available as opposed to say just in time or one by one. But we'd look to tap into a variety of investors, many of who manage billions -- hundreds of billion dollars of investments, would have a competitive cost of capital, and are very interested in long-term contracted assets which is obviously what we're about -- I'd say this is not any of our numbers for AES, this would all be upside to AES. I think as Ali asked, the Ullico transaction is quite indicative, thematically they would look to do it on a larger scale and with a variety of investors.","I would say we're not focused -- at least I will not be focused on public market alternatives. But it's really -- the things I've done in terms of working in the industry, in terms of working with partners, and also more recently for the last year too have been very focused on our green growth. I think I'm excited about it; I'd say -- and I think we've gotten some questions, this is not about me slowing down, I think -- some of you know I tried that about seven or eight years ago and it was -- my wife told me that was a failed experiment. And even then I had a little league baseball team to coach that was successful but now the only baseball team I could coach would be a fraternity softball team that would be kind of awkward. For me it's a new challenge, it could be quite interesting and it could be quite beneficial for AES.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Maybe to follow-up on the financing front; I know you alluded to rolling things forward next year but you also alluded to growing the dividend more of -- I think your term as an industry average. Why is that the case; how are you thinking about financing the growth in the balance between earnings growth and dividend -- ongoing dividend and dividend growth at this point?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","As I said, we will review the dividend with the board in December, and I think -- we have -- depending on the time period you take, we've been growing the dividend over the last, say five years, it's like 27%; almost more than 9% in the last four years. So we're saying that we will expect it to grow it, more in line with the industry average. In terms of finding the capital, as Tom mentioned, this new initiative would be upside. And one of the things that we've been able to do is really transform this company into a company much more based I'd say on renewables and leading technologies; and we've been able to do that in part by using third-party capital to grow.","So we feel that in the space going forward economies of scale are very important, and we really want to be a low cost constructor\/developer. And that we have $4.2 billion of discretionary cash available from 2018 to 2020 but this would be additional to that. I would also say that in terms of sort of our guidance for the next couple of years, we feel very good about that and we also feel that just to give you an example, it is resilient to -- for example, any likely outcome in Bulgaria but we feel good about our guidance and we have upside from finding more third-party capital like we've done, very successfully. We also have upside I would say regarding commercializing more of the LNG storage capacity, we feel very good that -- I had been saying for a lot of calls saying that we had this excess capacity, we've planned to commercialize it.","Well, in the Dominican Republic we'd pretty much use that capacity. Now that doesn't mean we can't do more, I mean we could do everything from differently logistics to parking FSU, to even building a second tank if the demand continues to grow.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Actually since you're bringing it up, I'd be curious just if you can more clearly define how much -- what is the EPS upside from the LNG updates today to be very clear? And also, if you can clarify the FX -- I know you're shorting the Argentine peso on '20; how much of a benefit is that versus what you initially targeted in your 8 to 10 for the FX swing that we've seen in the year-to-date period?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","On the year-to-date you're right that we're -- there are a lot of things going on with the Argentine peso; I mean there was some tax assets which caused -- we had to book a loss in the prior quarter on a regular ongoing basis because we have a big back-office operations there, we are slightly -- I would say, short the Argentine peso, so it's not a major issue going forward. Now having said that, the Argentine peso has appreciated of recent and the situation has stabilized, and -- when I talk to a lot of you, I said really the key leading indicator was to look at the agreement with the IMF. So it's in place, it's being executed well; so we see the regulatory developments there as positive in addition to that.","So in terms of the upsides, I don't want to go any further than what I've said in the past that we have approximately an upside for -- AES Panama would be about $60 million on an ongoing basis, if we're able to utilize all of that storage capacity as we have in the case of the Dominican Republic. And as I said prior with Total [ph], we're already making progress on selling gas to third-parties and as any contracts are signed or made concrete we will let you know.","Operator","Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.","Angie Storozynski","Can you provide us with an update what is the asset sales target right now? Maybe you have a view on what's the targeted number of countries that you're going to be exposed to? And also in a pie chart with allocation of excess funds, you talk about some potential incremental debt pay down; if you can explain what that's for and then what's roughly the use of the remaining cash?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Let me take the first part, then I'll pass it over to Tom to talk about the cash allocation. What we had announced was a program of around $2 billion. We've already completed $1.3 billion and we haven't -- the big chunk which was the sale of Eletropaulo and [indiscernible] in the Philippines we've received; there is some money coming in from the 24% sell down of sPower to Ullico. So that leaves about $700 million left to complete the program. That can be done in several ways, I mean that can be selling out to some countries or businesses or selling down. As you know, we don't talk about it until it's concrete because it -- we feel that that is most appropriate with our people.","And as you know, we've -- in some of the countries like, say The Netherlands, we've exited our big asset there, we just have energy storage left in The Netherlands, so we continue to simplify our portfolio. So I'll pass it to Tom to talk about the potential pay down of additional debt.","Tom O'Flynn ","So the $450 million on Slide 26 maybe about 40% of that would be without asset sales, i.e. just to continue to get our metrics down from 4.3 to under 4 and hit our investment grade target objectives. The other 60% be related to asset sales; that amount varies depending upon how cash rich the earnings are or the equity is from the asset sales but we'll call it $250 million, $300 million would be there as a placeholder for asset sales. As you know, we don't really comment on asset sale candidates until it's fully cooked and we're at the point of -- at or very close to announcement.","Angie Storozynski","And just one follow-up; you continue to expect the rich investment grade metrics by the end of 2019. Can you tell us if you have the discussions of credit agencies that give you a sense when those potential upgrades would happen, would we really have to wait until 2020?","Tom O'Flynn ","We've obviously been discussing this with the agencies for the last two or three years. Our parent cash flow numbers are very consistent, when we have meetings -- when we talk about what we said we're going to do, what we've done it's very straightforward story. I think the agencies have on-time in general, maybe they can always be a little quicker but in general, they have appreciated our credit moves and our forward-looking commitment that comes from -- obviously, the finance team from Andres and from the Board. So our target here is to hit the numbers next year and we think there may be some seasoning, obviously if we can season faster, we'll make that case and try to see whether we can get the actual upgrades sooner. But I think from a planning standpoint, we think it's reasonable to hit numbers next year and have a little bit of seasoning and get the letters in 2020.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I would like to add that there is not only the numerical aspect but the qualitative aspect. And so now that we're over 80% contracted in dollars, as our contract length increase, as we complete the construction projects, as we go more into renewables -- and in addition, we've already significantly reduced our commodity exposure, we've reduced our weather exposure as well, for example, with the gas coming online in Panama that decreases our weather exposure by 50%. So if you look at it, it's not only quantitative but it's really qualitatively where we're at, and we feel that that's an important component in our discussions with the rating agencies and why we feel confident with some appropriate seasoning, we're on-track to become investment grade.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolf Research.","Steve Fleishman","Do you have any information on the pricing of the sPower sell down you can provide us?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think it hasn't closed Steve, so we will not be talking more and more in detail about that at this point. What I could say is that like all our sell downs, it helped us increase our return, our invested capital which is part of the purpose of what we've been doing, we sell down and obviously to people who have a lower cost of capital than we do, and we provide the development and the economies of scale.","Steve Fleishman","Just maybe some color as we think about the renewable backlog growth. The 13% return that you're now earning on the operating asset you've bought; is that a rough kind of target for what you kind of see coming through the growth backlog or how should we think about that aspect?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think we have just separated by market and by product type; so yes, I think that's -- from the U.S., that's an appropriate range that you're giving. We would expect to make more outside the U.S., we expect to make more where it's part of the green blend and extend product. So we're finding ways to increase our returns and we think they're very competitive, we're working very hard to reduce the costs on these projects, by scale and by synergies with existing assets. So green blend and extend, plus our local platforms, plus what we've already achieved in the U.S., plus continued use of third-party capital; so all these things we expect to continue to be in the range as we've given or we've achieved today.","Steve Fleishman","And then maybe just any sense on the timing of more clarity on the new -- kind of more structured third-party venture that Tom you're leading; when we might have more color on that?","Tom O'Flynn ","It will probably be in the next year to be honest. How we're doing, obviously, we're trying to ramp things up, we also need to be mindful just -- in which forms we talk about things but it will probably be in the -- let's say Q2 of next year.","Steve Fleishman","And then lastly, you threw out this DNM [ph] LNG project which sounds very large. Could you just give us maybe a little more color on that project and when it -- what you need to do to make it officially kind of part of your backlog?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I mean, right now it's preliminary, we've signed an MOU, I mean it was part of the President Trump's visit to Vietnam, it was one of the marquee projects which were signed, it's a joint venture with Petro Vietnam; so right there we have a partner to start-off with. This is just the LNG storage and regasification, actually it would satisfy existing demand a lot of it, so unlike our prior projects it would be much more utilized and say just off the get-go because it's replacing offshore gas which they've used to-date and it's running out; so it's bringing LNG to substitute that. This would be a project that -- if it goes along, and again, it's preliminary, would come online probably something like 2023. And there are other power blocks associated with that, we don't have an MOU or anything signed or any associated power blocs with it but it's obvious that we've been successful in bringing gas to Central America, bringing gas to the Caribbean, it would be a natural add-on. And as you know, we have a bigger platform company in Vietnam already operating very successfully.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Turnure with JP Morgan.","Christopher Turnure","You touched on a couple of items in your prepared remarks but I was wondering if you can give us a sense as to kind of performance in 2018 so far from existing assets, and what might not repeat in 2019; that lightning strike I think was one of them. But I'm particularly interested in Southland and the ramped up performance of that [ph]?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","You've touched on I'd think two items. I mean that certainly, Southland, it was a capacity constraint and we were able to dispatch profitably from that plant. I think that the case of the lightning strike was also very much unexpected and is a very odd circumstance, the way it happened. But those I'd say were the most two, I'd say in general our operational performance has been good this year. So other than some lumpiness in the tax rates, I don't expect any significant differences for next year; hopefully, no lightning strikes in this case but perhaps we had a little bit of the offset in the case of Southland. I don't know Tom, if you want to add anything.","Tom O'Flynn ","No, I think that's fair. I think once again, relative to some prior years, we're explaining some things with hydrology and other things. I think the businesses are performing very much on target.","Christopher Turnure","And then, I don't know if I missed this in one of the earlier responses but -- Tom, you indicated that the dividend growth rate was something that you wanted to be in line with the industry average. Can you give us a bit more color on that? And if the payout ratio is something that you're considering here as well, and if so, how you define that?","Tom O'Flynn ","I think I'll let you be the judge of industry average which you can look at people who are generally from the utility industry is what we think is a reasonable group. So it will be less than nine but still a good number and still a good return when you combine dividend growth with earnings growth. In general, we have used about half of our parent free cash flow for the dividend, we don't have a defined payout ratio but in general, our wallet -- the affordability of the dividend is determined by long-term sustainable parent free cash flow, and that's been generally around the 50% range, that's -- I think that's a more meaningful number than earnings growth.","Christopher Turnure","And given the investment kind of horizon that you have right now versus kind of where you've been for the past couple of years, is it fair to say that you have competitive usage of that capital that you maybe didn't have before?","Tom O'Flynn ","Generally I think -- we think dividend growth is a meaningful part of our value proposition as I said. But certainly as we look at over a backlog, the 2 gigs of renewable sign is here, we think 2.5 and 3 over the next couple of years is very reasonable given our run rate. So we think that is generally about $300 million to $400 million of AES equity when you back out leverage, U.S. and tax equity, some partnerships, generally but $300 million to $400 million. So we think, yes, as our parent free cash flow grows up to the end of this 2020 horizon we're at 800 or over, we think we have the ability with some modest dividend growth and to invest in our businesses.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Chris, I'd also add in sort of the longer time horizon; we'll also be doing less than pay down once we reach investment grade. So more of the credit improvements will come from the growth in our cash flow rather than that pay down. We've done the heavy lifting, I mean if you look at that chart, you know have well over $1.2 billion that we've already done in terms of debt pay down this year; so we'll have more cash available for other things.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lasan Johong with Auvila Research Consulting.","Lasan Johong","I [indiscernible] but it sounds like AES is going to be exiting the coal-fired generation business, at least new construction going forward; am I taking too much of a conclusion here?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","What I would say is the following that -- certainly, we've been reducing our coal-fired generation as a proportion of our fleet, we're retiring about -- retired or sold over 3 gigawatts this year, I should probably go about this year. So certainly we're building over 2 gigawatts to 3 gigawatts going forwards of renewables a year, so that is going to switch. We're going to release our report next week, and we can be discussing that more with you. So the way this is coming is that -- it's really our renewables are growing, and we're selling or shutting down on economical coal; so this is a natural transition and we will achieve our goals basically really just following good business principles.","I would say furthermore that we have to complete the coal plant in India, OPGC 2, and that will very likely be the very last coal plant that AES built. The company has done -- I think had a remarkable transition because if you go back say 10 years, that was really sort of our strongest core competency; so now it's renewables, new technologies and combining, quite frankly, existing thermal or hydro capacity with the renewables. I mean one of things I think people don't talk about enough is the need for capacity and not just energy, and so what we're doing is really by green blend and extend is a way of combining capacity with energy.","Lasan Johong","I know at least a couple of years ago, AES was pursuing [indiscernible] in Vietnam; is it safe to say that that is no longer going to be the case going forward?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes.","Lasan Johong","Can you layout for us what the global opportunities sat for LNG and renewables that AES is pursuing going forward?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think it's a little bit hard, I mean -- I think the way I look at this is right now what's an addressable universe for us. So I think the 7 gigawatt of green blend and extend in the three markets we mentioned, that's -- to some extent sort of proprietary to us, that's existing contracts where we can add renewable energy and get a longer contract from that. I mean, in many of those cases as we can provide new renewable power cheaper than the variable cost of -- for example, burning coal on those units; but we still have the capacity contract for the coal, so we combine capacity with cheaper renewable energy. So that's -- that could be quite -- that could be larger as you have more renewable penetration in other markets. I would add that most of these aren't -- really aren't dependent on subsidies, it's just really the cost of new renewable power versus the variable cost of existing thermal power in some of these markets.","Now regarding LNG, that's a fuel that's -- especially with the shale gas revolution in the U.S., you're going to have long-term low prices from the U.S., and you have sufficient liquefaction capacity. So, for example, if you look at the Dominican Republic, the costs for the country of importing U.S. LNG versus burning diesel and heavy fuel oil is saving the country about $500 million a year. It's also reducing carbon output by 4 million tons a year; so that could be replicated in the Dominican Republic. Now in the case of Vietnam, they are running out of gas, they need the gas; so this is very much a needed project and obviously, there is a great interest. So I think that as you see, we have a robust pipeline; one of things Tom will be pursuing is ways that we can leverage our own capital to do more of these projects and increase our return on our invested capital. So there is ample opportunities now. I would also say that we're not pursuing all for growth sake, if we don't see the returns we're not going to make the investments.","Lasan Johong","Just following on that LNG issue; it seems to me that it's rational for AES to go up the food chain, meaning, do a liquefaction facility. I understand there is land near Southland that AES owns, any chance of putting a liquefaction facility there?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","That is not part of our plans. We don't see that as our core competency, there is a lot of liquefaction available. Furthermore, we do have the strategic relationship with Total, and Total can provide our final customers with structured projects -- products that we cannot; so it's been very successful thus far and we look forward to doing that more but there are no plans to go up the food chain.","Lasan Johong","Once you get your investment grade rating it could be argued that financing projects at the corporate level versus doing bankers free [ph] amount of subsidiary it's going to be lower cost to AES and the shareholders. A) Do you see it that way? B) Ami I kind of dreaming this up or it's just a process that -- yes, it will eventually up?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","It's interesting. I think that train left the station a long time ago; I think we're going to stick with our process to have the businesses, the projects stand on their own, and AES will provide equity. I think that's the way the house is built and I don't see it being rebuilt.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

Thank you and you may now begin.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Alicia. Good morning and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available at our website at aes.com.","Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during this call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me today are Andres Gluski, our Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team.","With that, let me turn the call over to Andres. Andres?","Andres Gluski","Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Today I will briefly cover our results and the progress we have made on our strategic plan. Then Tom will give a detailed discussion of our results, as well as our expectations for the future. After that I will provide additional color on our plan to drive our growth going forward.","Turning first to our results on Slide 4. As I look back on 2013 I am pleased to report that we achieved strong results. We met or exceeded our guidance for every metric and that is due to the hard work and dedication of our entire team.","In the fourth quarter we earned $0.29 of adjusted EPS, which is $0.02 less than what we earned in 2012, due to a $0.02 headwind from poor hydrology and a $0.04 expense related to potential customer refunds at Eletropaulo.","For the full year 2013 we earned adjusted EPS of $1.29, which is a new high and 7% above 2012. We achieved these results despite a $0.13 impact on earnings in 2013 from the unprecedented drought in Latin America. This was offset by capital allocation, lower G&A expenses, and lower effective tax rate. Over the past two years our adjusted EPS has grown on average by more than 8% annual.","Turning to cash flow. Our fourth quarter proportional free cash flow grew by 19% over 2012, driven primarily by higher operating cash flow. Our full year 2013 proportional free cash flow was $1.25 billion and represents a free cash flow yield of 12%. Since 2011 our proportional free cash flow has grown on average 13% annually, reflecting our strong cash flows and in accordance with our dividend policy, we increased our dividend payment by 25% to $0.05 per share each quarter beginning in the first quarter of 2014.","Now, turning to Slide 5. I believe our results to-date show our commitment to grow shareholder value through the three main strategic objectives we set forth in 2011. Improving the profitability of the company through overhead reduction and making greater use of our portfolio synergies and scale economies, narrowing our geographic focus by concentrating our growth on platform expansion in those markets where we have a sustainable competitive advantage and exiting those markets where we do not, and optimizing our capital allocation to compete our growth projects risk adjusted returns against the benefit of share buybacks and debt paydowns.","Turning to Slide 6. During the year, we were able to close or announce $497 million in asset sales, bringing our total to $1.4 billion since we started the program in September of 2011. We have simplified our portfolio and we now operate in 20 countries, down from 28, two years ago.","As you can see on Slide 7, the funds from these sales contributed to our available discretionary cash, which we have used to maximize the risk adjusted return to our shareholders. In fact, since 2011, we have paid down a $1 billion in debt; we have bought back 59 million shares for $711 million at an average price $12.03 per share and reduced our share count by 8%.","Lastly, turning to Slide 8. We achieved an additional $53 million in sustainable overhead savings in 2013, bringing our total to $143 million for a reduction of more than 30% over the past two years. Last quarter, we increased the targeted reduction in our overhead run rate to $200 million by 2015.","Now, before I walk you through our long-term plan, let me turn this call over to Tom, who will provide additional detail on our results and our expectations for growth in earnings and cash flow over the next five years.","Tom O'Flynn","Thanks, Andres, good morning everyone. First, I will cover our fourth quarter and full year 2013 results, then I will discuss our 2014 guidance, capital allocation plans, and then our longer-term outlook.","Let me first address the quarter on Slide 10. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.29 this year versus $0.31 a year ago. Performance was driven by three issues in our Brazil, and our Mexico, Central America and Caribbean or MCAC, Strategic Business Units or SBUs.","We experienced a reduction of Sul related to the tariff reset in April of 2013, as expected, one-time expense of $0.04 per share potential customer refunds Electropaulo and continued poor hydrology in Panama, which I will discuss shortly. Alongside these items we had a better operating performance in our U.S., in our Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA SBUs. This performance was offset by anticipated declines at Andes for planned maintenance and Masinloc in Asia where our new 7-year contract is below 2012 is relatively high stock prices.","Additionally debt repayment in early 2013 and lower parent interest expense made positive contributions. We also had a $0.05 benefit from a lower than expected effective tax rate of 18% versus 30% largely driven by one-time items including favorable resolution certain tax issues.","Although excluded from our adjusted EPS of $0.29, we took a goodwill impairment charge at DPL of $0.41 per share. DPL's recent rate case resolution provides clarity for 2016. However lower expectations for dark spreads and capacity prices represent challenges for this business in longer-term. As a result, DPL recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment of $370 million in the quarter.","Let me provide a couple of business updates. At DPL in the U.S., we are seeking to have the Ohio Commission approve our plan to transfer our generation assets to an affiliated Genco by May 2017. We'll explore all potential options to optimize the solution and we recently began to evaluate the sale of DPL generation asset to an unaffiliated third-party through a potential sale. Obviously we can't comment much as we're in the very early stage of this process.","Now turning to Maritza in Bulgaria. The plant has been running very well with excellent availability and we've received a $150 million of payment since our last call. Currently we have approximately $160 million of receivable, with $72 million is due in installments over the next 10 months and the majority of the remaining amount is less than 60 days outstanding.","Now turning to Slide 11, before I discuss our full year 2013 adjusted PTC and adjusted EPS results, I'll cover hydrology, which resulted in a negative adjusted PTC impact of $124 million or $0.13 per share in 2013. Hydrology was low across almost all of Latin America last year.","Two quarters or $0.10 of the impact was in Panama, as you see in the right hand side of the slide. In Panama roughly 60% of the generation capacity is hydro, with limited reservoir capacity, making the market more sensitive to rainfall. We've taken some steps to mitigate our exposure to these pressures to capping some contracts at actual production levels. Although Panama is in its typical dry season now, we're seeing water inflows in 2014 that have been below average so far.","In Brazil, the hydrology risk is reduced through risk sharing mechanism at all generators. Therefore, Tiet\u00ea impact from hydrology tends to be moderate in most weather conditions except in the cases of a severe system wide drought. Brazil is currently in its rainy season, with 2014 has been below average so far. Current reservoir levels are roughly 39%, which is lower than the 46% level this time last year, and the historical average of 68%. Having said that, reservoir levels will be dependent on the rainy season, which runs through April.","In Columbia, hydro risk is reduced by our significant reservoir capacity. Based on our current forecast, we anticipate normal hydro conditions in Columbia during 2014.","Finally, we have some hydro capacity in our diversified operations in Chile and Argentina. In Chile, Genre had a $0.01 impact in 2013 from low hydrology, in '14; we are less exposed as contract levels are better aligned with generation output. Our business in Argentina has a more limited hydro exposure due to our diversified portfolio. Overall, we expect an improvement in hydrology this year. We're monitoring conditions closely in our key markets.","Next, I will walk through adjusted PTC drivers for 2013. Turning to Slide 12, our SBUs generated $1.8 billion of PTC before $600 million of corporate charges. As you can see, our earnings are well diversified across our SBUs.","Now to Slide 13, which shows a comparison of our adjusted PTC performance relative to the expectation we provided in May of last year. We achieved $1.2 billion of adjusted PTC, which is in the range we forecasted but with a different mix. U.S. outperformed our expectations due to lower than expected customer switching in DPL. Andes and MCAC were below the expected ranges mainly due to lower hydro and higher energy purchase cost. In Brazil, adjusted PTC was affected by a lower demand at Sul as well as the Eletropaulo charge I mentioned earlier. Finally, EMEA and Asia were in line with expectations.","As you see on Slide 14, this year we overcame significant impacts from poor hydrology and the provision related to potential customer refunds in Brazil, increased our adjusted EPS to $1.29 per share. We benefited from capital allocation, lower global G&A and a lower effective tax rate of 21% versus 32% in 2012.","Moving on to cash flow, beginning on Slide 15, for 2013 proportional free cash flow of $1.16 billion surpassed our guidance range of $750 million to $1.05 billion. As you may know, we define this as net cash from operations less maintenance capital expenditures, which includes all environmental capital expenditures. We have modified this now to exclude recoverable environmental CapEx as it makes more sense to treat these investments as growth CapEx that will increase earnings.","For 2013, this represents a MATS-related CapEx at IPL. Using this methodology, proportional free cash flow in 2013 was $1.27 billion. The results were above the top end of our guidance range for 2013 as defined on the same basis. This improvement was largely driven by lower maintenance CapEx some of which we have pushed into 2014.","In 2013, we used more than $560 million of our proportionate free cash flow to paydown non-recourse debt at our subsidiaries. This is consistent with paydowns in recent years. This debt paydown at subsidiaries create equity value we can capture through improved growth capacity, proceeds from refinancings, or other distributions. The remaining cash is available for use at the SUBs and the parent.","Turning to Slide 16, in our 2013 parent capital allocation activity. During 2013, we had $1.2 billion of discretionary cash available including parent free cash flow. As you may remember, we forecasted '13 parent free cash flow in the range of $400 million to $500 million. We came in above this range at $516 million. This was largely driven by better operating performance at our Kilroot plant in Northern Ireland as well as reductions in parent interest. We've invested roughly 82% of those cash in deleveraging and returning cash to shareholders.","Next on to Slide 17, I will discuss guidance beginning with 2014 adjusted EPS. We expect our SBU level adjusted PTC contributions to grow by roughly 8% to $2 billion. We anticipate growth at our Andes, Brazil, MCAC, and EMEA SBUs, which is largely driven by a combination with improvement in hydrology, higher availability and improved efficiencies across our portfolio.","As I discussed earlier, hydrology had a $0.13 negative impact in 2013, and improvement is the most significant positive swing in our guidance this year. We expect our U.S. and Asia SBUs be flat or modestly down. In light of the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, I'd like to point out that we expect about $60 million of PTC from Argentina, which is less than 3% of our annual PTC.","Growth from our other SBUs be largely offset by increased tax rate in the roughly 30% range versus 21% in 2013. Bottom line is we expect to earn adjusted EPS of $1.30 to $1.38. Growth in '14 will be mostly driven by improved operations, cost efficiencies, and capital allocation, partially offset by higher tax rate.","Now to Slide 18, and our longer-term adjusted EPS expectations. Today we reaffirmed our target through '15 and initiated our longer-term outlook, which combined with our current dividend offers an attractive total return, particularly given our valuation. We're driving future grow through multiple levers, including improving profitability, platform expansions, and opportunistic capital allocation.","For 2015 we see year-to-year adjusted EPS growth of 46%, consistent with our prior expectations. This is largely driven by positive contributions from completed construction projects including Mong Duong in Vietnam, and IPP4 in Jordan, as well as capital allocation.","For 2016, we expect flat to modest growth. Despite the fact we anticipate an $0.11 drop or roughly 8% of our earnings at Tiet\u00ea and DPL. At Tiet\u00ea where our existing contract with Eletropaulo were transitioned to market prices at the end of 2015, we're anticipating impact of about $0.08. Further lower capacity prices in PJM and DPL rose out in a drop of about $0.03.","However this impact is more than offset by continued contributions from completed construction projects in Chile, rate base growth at IPL, a full year of operations at Mong Duong and capital allocation. We appreciate that this is below our growth trend line. Having said that 2016 is still a couple of years out and we need some time to work on improving this outlook.","In 2017 and 2018, we expect 6% to 8% average annual growth. Our performance will be driven by contributions from the Alto Maipo and OPGC projects currently under construction, cost reductions, and capital allocation.","Our 2014 to 2018 outlook is based on foreign currency exchange rate and commodity curves as of year-end '13 but do not change much in last couple of months. In general the forward curves imply an appreciating U.S. Dollar against most currencies over the next few years, shows a negative impact on our earnings by a couple of cents each year saving 1 percentage points to 2 percentage points of our growth rates.","Regarding tax rate, we're projecting effective tax rate in the low to mid 30% range, which assumes an expansion of the CFC look-through rule and the impact of roughly $600 million of additional assets sales by 2015. It's also worth mentioning these asset sales tend to be modestly dilutive with key assumptions and sensitivities in the appendix.","Now to cash flow on Slide 19. In 2014 we expect our proportional free cash flow to be roughly $1.2 billion. Consistent with our expectations for adjusted PTC we're expecting an increase proportional free cash flow contributions from Andes, Brazil, and MCAC, partially offset by fewer contract modification. A relatively flat comparison with '13 reflects $100 million impact of a combination of higher environmental CapEx at Gener and the sale of our business in Cameroon.","Beyond '14 we're targeting growth on average of 10% to 15% annually. The main reason that the proportional free cash flow will grow faster than the earnings include first the expected contributions from our ongoing construction projects as they come online will depreciate much greater than maintenance CapEx. This is consistent with our current operating portfolio where our 2013 proportional depreciation was roughly $975 million and proportional maintenance CapEx was $610 million; second, the lease accounting treatment from Mong Duong where cash flow is higher than earnings due to levelization of a 25 year PPA; and third, the completion of environmental CapEx in Chile.","Turning to our 2014 parent capital allocation on Slide 20. We expect that roughly $900 million of discretionary cash, which assumes only announced asset sales and they grow from additional monetization activities. This includes approximately $500 million to parent free cash flow which we expect to grow in line with the 10% to 15% growth we're targeting in our proportional free cash flow.","In terms of planned uses, we anticipate paying down a $140 million of corporate debt, a $110 million of which has already been done. Another $145 million is year marked for dividend. We recognize that this is at the low end of our 30% to 40% payout ratio and see room to increase our dividend as our parent free cash flow grows.","We intend to invest roughly $100 million in the upcoming Gener capital raise. After other commitments we've already laid out, we have $200 million to $300 million of discretionary cash for capital allocation. In that context I'll note that our additional equity requirements beyond '14 for our projects currently under construction is $400 million and our current stock buyback authorization is approximately $190 million. As we demonstrated we're committed to investing in our shares as evidenced by our repurchase of 20 million shares for $260 million on a single day last December.","Overall we believe that our portfolio is well positioned to deliver an attractive risk adjusted return. The growth in our free cash flow will allow us to continue to create value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll now turn it back to Andres.","Andres Gluski","Thanks, Tom. Now turning to Slide 21, I'd like to give you some color on where we will focus our efforts over the next several years. As Tom just reviewed, we see strong growth in our proportional free cash flow of 10% to 15% annually. We plan to allocate this cash to create value for our shareholders and drive higher earnings growth, which we see accelerating in 2017 and beyond.","We will achieve our future growth by focusing our efforts on the following four strategic levers, performance excellence, reducing complexity, expanding access to capital, and leveraging our platforms.","Let me walk you through each of these in more detail. First, our results are based on achieving performance excellence, not only at our operating businesses but also at our corporate headquarters. Our objective is to be the low cost manager of a portfolio of businesses from which synergies and economies of scale can be derived. As I discussed earlier, our global G&A costs are one-third lower than they were two years ago. Through the consistent application of our rigorous asset management framework we have established ourselves as a high performance operator as evidenced by our three consecutive Edison International awards since 2011.","Nonetheless, there is still room for further improvement and we will continue to use our Six Sigma life program called APEX for AES performance excellence to help drive additional efficiencies.","Second, in an effort to continue to reduce our complexity, we have exited many of the markets where we do not have a competitive advantage and reorganize our businesses into six market facing strategic business units. We have also expanded our disclosure to help investors better appreciate the underlying drivers of our business.","We will continue to simply our portfolio and to look for opportunities to harvest capital that can be redeployed to yield better return. To that end we will generate another $500 million to $700 million in asset sale proceeds by 2015. We believe that in the longer-term, we will operating in no more than 15 to 16 countries. This focus enable us to spend more time engaging with stakeholders in our key markets and allows us to manage our businesses more efficiently, lowering our all-in costs per megawatt hour produced and sold.","Third, we're working to expand our access to capital markets through strategic partnership at the project level in accessing niche financing like pension funds in Chile. Having partnered at the project level allows us to sculpt that portfolio to maximize risk adjusted return for our shareholders. For example, last year we closed $500 million of partnerships including Antofagasta Minerals and our Alto Maipo hydro project in Chile, and Google at our Mount Signal Solar project in California. We are currently working on several more partnership opportunities including selling down a portion of our equity stake in some existing businesses and bringing on equity partners with low cost financing or offering a TPA for our development projects. Our strong competitive position in operating a construction track record provides potential partners with superior investment opportunities, while increasing returns on our equity.","And fourth, we will continue to leverage our platforms by focusing our growth in our current markets to take full advantage of our existing infrastructure, local knowledge, permits, and presence. A reflection of this focus on platform expansion is a number of twos and threes following the names of many of our growth projects such as Ventana III and IV, Guacolda III and IV and now even V. They are literally Brownfield expansions from existing plant. We have many similar platform expansion opportunities across our development pipeline of 6000 megawatts, including the expansion of our existing facilities in the Philippine, India, and Dominican Republic, continued expansion of AES Gener in Chile, new generation opportunities in Columbia and Mexico, IPL's Eagle Valley combined cycle gas plant and the repowering of Southland.","In addition to expanding our generation facilities we're continuing to build out adjacent businesses such as energy storage and water desalinization plants. We are also investing in enhancements such as adding fogging technology on combustion turbines at our gas plant or getting more megawatt out of our hydro plant water intake structures. Such projects have a much shorter development and construction period than traditional Greenfield projects.","As a result of these advantages, we are seeing returns well in excess of 20% from these adjacencies and enhancements. We aim to be earning at least $40 million in pre-tax earnings from these efforts by 2015. To that end, we will continue to develop and invest in new energy storage project. AES is already the world's largest grid scale energy storage operator. With more than 170 megawatt of resource currently in operation and we have another 40 megawatt project currently under construction in Chile adjacent to our Cochrane plant. We are actively developing other energy storage opportunities at our existing platforms in California, the Philippines, Northern Ireland, and Puerto Rico.","In addition to energy storage, several other adjacent projects are well underway including a 20 megawatt capacity expansion at our Chivor hydro facility in Columbia and 800 cubic meter per hour desalination facility at our Angamos plant in Chile and more than a 100 megawatt of additional capacity through fogging enhancements of some of our combustion turbulence. I would add that the cost of these additional 100 megawatt was approximately $10 million, making them the lowest cost capacity additions in our history.","Turning to Slide 22, I'm pleased to report that we are making tangible progress on our pipeline of platform expansions. Since our last call in November we've made significant progress on advancing two large power projects. First, we closed $1.2 billion in long-term non-recourse financing for the 531 megawatt Alto Maipo hydro electric project in Chile. This project is an expansion of our existing 178 megawatt Alfalfal facility, which will benefit from its proximity to Santiago and will diversify AES Gener's energy mix in a growing market. Given that most of our equity in this project will be funded through operating cash flow at Gener, we will only be contributing $100 million of capital from AES Corp.","In the Indian state of Odisha, OPGC, a company in which we have held a 49% interest for more than 10 years, broke ground on the 1320 megawatt expansion of its existing 420 megawatt power plant. We have already secured $1.2 billion in low cost, long-term, non-recourse financing to fund 75% of the project all in local currency.","We expect our total equity commitment to be around $225 million, of which $100 million will be largely met through our share of cash-on-hand at OPGC and the balance will be funded by contributions from AES in 2016. The project benefits from low cost local coal, a partnership with the Government of Odisha, a PPA with OPGC's current offtaker and the rapidly growing demand for liquidity in and around the state of Odisha.","Now turning to Slide 23, we currently have 4,000 megawatts of new capacity under construction, including the two projects I just discussed as well as Mong Duong in Vietnam and two other projects in Chile, Cochrane and Guacolda V. All of these projects are expected to come online over the next five years.","As I previously mentioned, in addition to our projects under construction, we have a development pipeline of more than 6000 megawatts, including platform expansion to IPL, Masinloc in the Philippines, and Southland in California. The fact the project is currently under construction, we're making good progress on the environmental upgrade of 2400 megawatts at Indianapolis Power and Light with a total investment of $500 million. This investment will bring our plants into compliance with current environmental regulation and will earn a regulator return on our equity investments of $230 million.","As you can see on Slide 24, the total cost of the project I just discussed is about $8 billion. The majority of this cost is funded by already secured non-recourse financing. More importantly our share of the equity in these projects is approximately $1.25 billion, two-thirds of which is already funded. We will contribute the remaining $400 billion through 2016. In terms of the blended return on investment, we're expecting a 14% return on our equity and a cash-on-cash return of approximately 18%.","Now turning to Slide 25. In summary 2013 was a strong year despite facing considerable headwinds and we continue to deliver on our commitment. Going forward, our growth will be driven by our 4,000 megawatt of project under construction and rate based growth at IPL, which is already largely funded. Performance excellence, including $200 million in cost reductions by 2015, and plan for additional savings beyond that date, and allocating our growing free cash flow to maximize risk adjusted returns for our shareholders.","The bottom line is that our portfolio generates a 12% free cash flow yield and we expect our cash to grow at 10% to 15% annually. As our parent free cash flow grows, we see room to increase our dividends in line with our policy of paying 30% to 40% of our sustainable parent free cash flow. And finally as we continue to execute on our strategy, we expect our total return to grow from the range of 6% to 8% to a range of 8% to 10%.","Operator, I'd now like to open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jon Cohen, and your line is now open.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group, Inc.","Actually I have a bunch of questions, maybe I'll ask a couple and then I'll get back into the queue. First a clarification, 2014 guidance, does that assume normal hydro conditions or kind of what you're seeing today and your best guess is where the reservoir levels are going to be?","Andres Gluski","Excuse me. That takes into consideration what we discussed on the call. In terms of a slightly lower hydro conditions overall and including Panama, it also includes the actions that we have taken to make ourselves say less sensitive to low hydrology than we had last year.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group, Inc.","So if we see another year that similar to 2013, would you still be in 130 to 138 range?","Andres Gluski","Given what our projections take into account what we've seen at hydrology, we expect some recovery and yes, that would put us within that range.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group, Inc.","And then Tom, can you just give us a sense of how proportional free cash flow will translate into parent free cash flow. So there -- is there a leverage, is there like a dollar for dollar dropdown from proportional to parent. So parent actually growing faster or should parent grow around the same as what proportional is growing at?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, I think parent will grow around the same. So we see a proportional free cash flow growing 10% to 15%. There could be cases when the parent can grow more because it\u2019s a little more leveraged let's say -- is -- is that the further on down the chain. The one thing I do want to point out is that, I just made sure it was clear, lot of proportional free cash flow debt go to debt paydown at the subs. And we generally say it's around 500 last year, its 560. So that doesn't increase the value of the subs, the subs increases the value to us and that we get that through growth or through other distributions.","In some cases the parent cash flow can grow faster than proportional free cash flow because of return of capital. And in the slide well we showed a little bit of return of capital last year.","Jon Cohen - ISI Group, Inc.","And I'll ask just one more, in terms of how you think about your packing order preference for capital allocation between buybacks and dividend growth and debt paydown, how do you actually go about doing that. I mean it would seem that given your current PE multiple and the fact that you have a nice pickup in EPS growth in '17 and '18 that it would be hard to find opportunities that are more accretive than buybacks, so you would rather do buybacks than dividends or paying down debt. I mean do you agree with that or do you look at it some other way?","Tom O'Flynn","The way I think is we have a balanced approach and I think we've shown that. I think we have to look at the long-term growth of the company. I think the returns that we're getting especially on some of the adjacencies are very attractive and compete with anything. And so we'll continue to do that, take a balanced approach and we will complete new projects versus buying back our shares or paying down debt.","So I think we'll continue to do what we've shown we've done and taking into balance what we see as sort of the long-term growth of the company and the other one offer opportunities to buy back our shares at an attractive price.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin and your line is now open.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","On Slide 39 the CFC extension that\u2019s incorporated into your tax rate guidance, could you give us a sense of just CFC extension does not occur, what the change to your guidance impact might be?","Andres Gluski","Sure, I mean what it does, I mean -- this -- we are let's say protected through the end of this year due to the actions that we took in the past. It would depend of course but I would say somewhere around $0.10 is about -- could be a little bit more, could be a bit less but that's, that's more or less where that sensitivity is.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And if the CFC is not extended that impact is something that should affect the ongoing outlook, right, that's not just a one-time event. Is that the right way to think about that?","Andres Gluski","Well it's -- that would be a change and I quite frankly say tax policy but going forward. So I think that yes, that's correct. Now what is important I think to keep in mind this will be non-cash for us. We have a stock of NOLs around $2 billion and we continue to generate NOLs and so this would not affect us from our cash generation point of view.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then one last topic for me. On Slide 42, so you've given out the commodity exposures for 2016. In your old slide for this, for 2015 you used to have that coal had a directional sensitivity that was in the same direction as gas and oil. In this slide your coal directional sensitivity is opposite gas and oil, can you just give some color as to why that is?","Andres Gluski","Well, certainly we have it should be the opposite it should be cheaper gas.","Andrew Vesey","So Brian it was negative, it was just reassured but it was negative to gas, even at that time so there's no change of the sensitivity.","Andres Gluski","Brian, by the way, one thing I'd like to clarify on your question regarding CFC look-through rule that's sort of $0.10 but again we're going to take additional steps if we see that this is going to happen. So just like in the past if you recall two years ago, we said we had more of the same sensitivity. We were all able to offset that. So we're going to take steps but before we had those steps actually in hand that's what the sensitivity would be.","Brian Chin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","But on this -- going back to this commodity exposure slide is just a function of fact that you're hedged in '15 a certain way but you're not hedged in '16 and so that's why the directional differences have flip-flopped is that right?","Andres Gluski","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith. Your line is now open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities","So first on the Ohio sale, could you elaborate just a little bit specifically would that include the non-bypass revenues, what exactly is contemplated for sale and what's the timeline here? And may be also to clarify how would you treat the generation portion of DPL in your earnings guidance given the fact that prior sales would be consolidated and treated as discontinued ops?","Tom O'Flynn","Julien, its Tom. So we did file an application for our separation. We filed an application that was referring nature shortly before New Year's in '13. We filed a little more detailed application. Yesterday that should be available via PUCO website. Basically gives a little more color on the methodology of separating the DP&L generation assets into a gentle affiliate. We're doing that layout that we've also begin to consider potential sale of the full DP&L's 3,000 megawatts plus generation fleet. We're doing that layout that we believe that if we do that the transition charges at the NBC and other related revenue stream should be retained by DP&L TND and the arguments that are laid out there that we think are very solid in the process. Just with respect to the process, we are just beginning. So as I said in my comments are kind of too soon to give any commentary.","On the disc ops I'll have to get back to on that one in terms of I don't think it's a separate business, so I think it would change kind of midstream as opposed to get disc ops during the year but we're still working through that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities","Any terms on what the EPS contributions from that business is this year and going on if you can just extract out the DPL portion and two generation portion?","Andres Gluski","Well I just say that if we can sell the generation on reasonable terms it could be modestly accretive.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities","And then just looking at the cash flow growth number you talked about the environmental CapEx offset and the maintenance CapEx kind of shifts. Can you talk about how much is environmental CapEx and how much is that broken out between Chile and as well as IPL is probably in there as well?","Andres Gluski","Okay. So gross numbers. The program we have at IPL we're operating at 2400 megawatts is about $500 million. The programs we have in Chile are around $200 million. And so the Chile -- that the difference in the sense that the ones at IPL become partner rate-based and the ones in Chile do not. And so the ones in Chile again we expect to complete by '14.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities","So that's a key driver in terms of the improvement in 10%?","Andres Gluski","It really is the biggest driver. It's the biggest driver of the improvement and with number of components to it but if you look at sustained cash flow improvement proportional free cash flow the biggest driver is out at Chile.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities","And then just one more if you don't mind. On the solar side, obviously there were some conversation last year about reevaluating the business where do you stand today in terms of that process, either selling down a further stake in that or monetizing it otherwise?","Andres Gluski","Well, I think we showed on the past that we are looking at various options and we will continue to look at various options and see really what's the best outcome for us and our partners at Riverstone.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities","Would you describe that if I push you a little bit further in terms of priorities amongst exiting other countries or relative to existing other countries is this a priority in '14? ","Andres Gluski","I would like so it's important to us to continue to look at this, but I'm not going to sort of rank them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris (inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","I had a question first on your free cash flow, your proportional free cash flow guidance through 2018. It's a pretty nice number to see and it's a pretty long time horizon to layout guidance for. First, could you give us a little bit more color on that versus what you gave in the slides? In other words, those are going to be lumpy, those are going to be consistent and what was behind your decision to kind of give that number that far out and same thing for EPS versus your previous comments that you would just kind of talk about everything through 2015?","Andres Gluski","First in terms of giving a sort of a longer-term planned horizon, as we're seeing our strategies play out and we're seeing the results of that strategy, we felt more confident in terms of being able to give a longer view of where the business would be going. To specifically answer the question of cash flow, there will be some lumpiness obviously because one of the key driver is when new plants come online. So we really have two things going on. One is to the extent that we can get some of the shorter term sort of adjacencies and enhancements and other profit improvements also will contribute in the shorter term and the other longer term will be when the newer plants come online. And as you can see we have a lot of plants coming on line '15 through '18.","Unidentified Analyst","And then my follow-up question is just on Eletropaulo I wanted some updated thought on how earnings are going to trend there and I wanted to also understand correctly if there is any hydrological risk to that business versus the risk at Tiet\u00ea?","Andres Gluski","I think that again regarding sort of Eletropaulo I would say the following one is that in Brazil, they basically have sort of a sharing mechanism for when there is a low hydrology between all the generators. So that it's not sort of directly specific to one business in particular when the cost of generation go up in the past the Brazilian Government has stepped in and helped with make credit available. Because there is a recovery mechanism even though it is overtime but it can cost shorter term liquidity problems so that the Brazilian Government has addressed that.","What I would say, which is very important when people try to compare this say back to 2002, because in 2002, Brazil had 4 gigawatts of thermal, it has 22 today. So that's a very important difference and have the experience. The other that there can be some benefit of therefore for example at Uduvayana (ph) where we see that we are likely to be running this plant in March and April. So there are some benefits from that. I don't know Andy would you like to add something.","Andrew Vesey","Yes, this is Andy Vesey, Chris. Just specifically around EP in terms of how it's exposed to -- what it's exposure to hydrological risk. When the EP actually had our Sul businesses under regulation in Brazil and under Brazil would work with they would always be just almost fully contracted with not more in the marketplace. Well at that case the impact would almost be negligible for the distribution businesses, but what has happened in Brazil is what used to be called MP579, which was the basically concession rules for some of the hydro is that a lot of these contracts couldn't be delivered on.","So actually Eletropaulo falls about 1% under contracted. Well that would look like basically be a cash flow issue for the Brazil would be paying energy at a spot price to make up that percentage it would be cash flow. But last year in a similar situation the treasury of Brazil stepped in and subsidized that provided that cash directly. So as Andres said the government has always made sure that keep the business with Sul and its relatively small exposure for EP.","Let's go back to Tom's opening comments while the hydrological situation is below average now we're expecting we probably will have a much better view on that in the April timeframe.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mara Shaughnessy. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","","A couple of questions. First on the Maritza situation, the concern was going into the winter when demand was up and the like may be things would have potentially gotten a little more bumpy it doesn't seem like that bumpiness that technical term bumpiness occurred and things seem on track is that a fair statement?","Andres Gluski","That's correct. I mean since our last call they state $150 million. We have an agreement in terms of part of those statements like around $76 million I believe is to be made over time and we have to see that they comply with that. So we continue to monitor it but we have gotten past I would say the worse of the heating season in Bulgaria without any sort of political repercussions. And certainly the governments focused on improving NEK and in terms of the financial situation of NEK. I think the great advantage of Bulgaria as I've said in the past it has a very little foreign debt so it's truly a question of NEK that's not a case where the government on some other occasions raise money and to inject it into NEK back that they so decided.","Unidentified Analyst","And this, I know this has been discussed already the hydrology situation. Can you be specific to Panama in last several months you guys have talked about the different things that you've done to try to mitigate the exposure there. The Brazilian seem every other hour discuss what the percentage reservoir pillages and we have an idea of that ad nauseam but Panama again is just who knows. Can you be specific as to what reservoir levels are right now relative to last year, relative to normal and what specific things have you done to mitigate that exposure?","Andres Gluski","Yes, I'll go ahead and pass this one on to Andy, but you're correct in the sense that the dispatch of the hydro in Panama is controlled by the government. But we've made some changes to some of our contracts and done some other things to reduce our exposure. One of them is including is that we sold down a portion (inaudible) to the government so that with the government is a co-owner of all of our plants in Panama. Andy would you like to add to that. ","Andrew Vesey","Yes, Mara its Andy Vesey. Just a broad background, we have fundamentally three hydro complexes in Panama. Bayano, which is one of two pondage hydro's in Panama, the other being Fortuna which is not ours, Chiriqui which is one of the river and Changuinola which is one of the river as well. The hydro I will give you some statistics around that as of January for Bayano which is the pondage hydro we're about 29% percent below the historical average. So that's a number for you. Chiriqui which is --","Unidentified Analyst","And how does that compare to last year?","Andrew Vesey","It is slightly worse than last year. You got two hydrological basins in Panama, Bayano is in one and Allegheny River is the other. And last year Bayano was actually doing quite well. What happened with Bayano was not in flows last year, it was a significant east-west transmission constraint in Panama which didn't allow them to get the energy to Panama City from the water hydro. So the government over dispatched Bayano. So while inflows were okay last year, they actually over dispatched it and that's what caused stress to us last year with Bayano. This year they had been preserving the hydro in Bayano, but the inflows had been less and what has happened is there was much more inefficient thermals because of that transmission constraint, which lays the spot market considerably.","But to Andre to your question we did change the ownership structure at Changuinola last year. We also changed the contract between Changuinola and AS Panama from a financial contract to a physical one as Tom had mentioned in this comments. And while I can't say much more about it we're currently in conversations with the Panama government on other regulatory solution, to significantly mitigate the hydro impact this year. It is dry, this is the dry season, but it is dry than normal and we'll have to wait again the rainy season will start in April\/May. So we have to see how we cover.","However to answer your question that has been put out, if indeed we have a year exactly like last year, if we are successful with the engagement with the Panama government that we're involved in, we should significantly be better than we did last year under the same hydrological conditions.","Unidentified Analyst","And then getting specifically to TSA in your assumptions you've an $0.08 hit from the roll up of the Eletropaulo contract at the end of '15. What is the assumed contracted price in that $0.08 hit?","Andres Gluski","We're assuming a 125, sort of where the market will be at. Our contracts today are about 116, no the existing ones. But I'm saying the ones -- that the portion that we have recontracted in the market so that's a step down from 180 to about 125.","Unidentified Analyst","And so what, I mean obviously we've seen spot prices 800 to 1000 plus, what is that -- I saw that you contracted some out at 125. Is there the potential in this sloppy environment or messy environment that you could be able to lock-in more now at higher prices that that?","Andres Gluski","Well the approach of the team has been to sort of contact it over time. So the first ones, as you recall we're at a lower price and then moving up. Hopefully I think there is a possibility of doing some higher like a 135. But I think that we're going to sort of stagger this not to take a one-time risk. I do think what we're seeing in Brazil is less of the -- the hydro's are coming on late, the new hydro. So our sort of belief that this would cause higher prices over time I think it's playing out. Andy do you want add something?","Andrew Vesey","The only thing I'd add to -- we have about 1200 megawatts of current capacity take to market. Currently about 700 of those megawatts have already been contracted delivering 16 is it three year term contractors all to the free customers. As Andres said the average price of that 700 megawatt has been about 115 on the margin now we assume between 125 and 135 and these are our expectations that the market will tighten and strengthen given both the current hydrological situation, lateness of hydro, and the need to add more thermal into the system. So we're being very cautious, we don't want to get ahead of our skews on this one. But the team has been very aware of the situation and is waiting to see the market to improve.","Unidentified Analyst","And what about the opportunities for TSA to build the isthmus gas plant. The government's made some of the pricing, the cap has been raised pretty materially and but who knows if you can actually access the gap. So what's the status of potentially plugging that hole with a thermal project?","Andres Gluski","You asked that I mean it's really a question of getting the gaps. We have two projects in very advanced stages of development. We are actually ready to go on them, of course in Brazil you have to win the bid. So that's an aspect in terms of how the bids are defined. Whether you have for example a gas specific one, whether you have like a gas factor that certainly would help. But there is still the issue of physical getting the gas.","As you know we do have Uduvayana, which is 670 megawatts written off, only ready to go we're going to run it in March and in April. And the solution there you know what we have been working very hard with both governments is to be able to get gas to Uduvayana through Argentina. For these sort of temporary runs Petrobas will be supplying the LNG to Argentina, will use existing pipelines. But that really would be a fantastic solution because we have a plant for free. Now the question is at what price can we get gas and right now deliver gas to Uduvayana is around $25 to million BT use. If we get it down to a more reasonable rate then it will be a competitive plan.","Operator","","Our next call comes from Ali Agha. Your line is now open.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I just have a couple of questions. One I just wanted to be clear on your earnings outlook that you laid out for us. If I go back to your original driver I think off the 12 actual of a $1.24 at that time, you talked about 4% to 6% EPS growth through '15. If I run the math right, right now the midpoint of 15 actually would be lower than the midpoint of that 4% to 6% growth rate. So has something changed? Can you just clarify how we should think about this '14-'15 period?","Tom O'Flynn","No, Ali, I think the midpoint was I think was 1.43, 1.44 and this implies about 1.41. So I think it's just Ben who has a calculator in his hand. So I think it's pretty much in the same neighborhood, so.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And then as you laid out your outlook '15 and beyond into '18 as well, what have you assumed for those merchant assets at DPL. Are they still embedded in that guidance whatever you assume that they have been taken out?","Andres Gluski","There embedded in the guidance.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Yes still in there and I think Tom if I heard you right, your sense was if they do exit on reasonable terms that should be accretive?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then the 6000--","Tom O'Flynn","I think I'd say Ali keep in mind that we got a portfolio management activity that could be dilutive. So at the end of the day there could be offsets. But yes, on a standalone basis we're doing on the right terms to be accretive.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And the 6000 megawatts of development projects beyond what's in construction. Have you resumed contribution from any of those in that five year period?","Andres Gluski","No, we because that would outside of that window.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","When you say that what do you mean in terms of contribution timeline.","Andres Gluski","In terms of contribution timeline. I mean if we start construction on them, we do have assumptions for using our pre-cash flow and capital allocation. But what can be shorter term again can be the adjacency. I had mentioned them on our call previously and that we're trying to get our hands around and put a stake in the round $40 million of PTC by 2015. So these are much shorter terms, much higher returns, but if you look at the bigger projects, we just started to now after (inaudible) and OPGC-2 and there'll also be sort of a 2018 stuff. So that will 6000 megawatts have a longer term horizon. ","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I see, and I think Andres you eluded to the fact that you got 4200 million of cost reductions through '15, more to come. Can you just give us a sense you know in that '15 to '18 period what kind of incremental cost reductions are embedded if any?","Andres Gluski","We have you know certain improvements embedded debt. I say the way to think about it, Ali, is we have $3 billion of discretionary spend or a variable spend. So something like a 5% improvement you know is something that we think is realistic. ","Andrew Vesey","Andy Vesey. In spite of that $3 billion number in fixed cost, (inaudible) I've spent a long time working on this. When we look at the $3 billion and we can look at what's controllable by management and take out any short sided cuts of maintenance. We've about $2.2 billion of cost that we should be targeting. In the sort of the expectations that both Andres and Tom laid out between '14 and '18, by '18 we will get to a run rate savings on those fixed costs on the order of $250 million. But it builds over time. So in '14 we have, we have about $50 million of that cost and it will build up over that period. And eventually will reach about 10% of our fixed costs.","What we set as a target that will drive us there as we set the view that we'll take that piled manageable fixed cost and keep it fixed. Each year we're going to put into place productivity improvements which will offset inflation and that's sort of how you should think about. And that's what we're going to go after. In addition to that, we'll continue to look for more opportunities in that space.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just to be clear that $250 million, is that over and above the $200 million or is that $200 million part of that $250 million.","Tom O'Flynn","","No, no, that was a completely different animals. In other words, when we talk about $200 million, we're talking about G&A, sort of global overhead. When you talk about the $250 million, that's really at the operational level.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I see, and the timeline to that 250 is what?","Tom O'Flynn","","Well as Andy said that's the next you know five year.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","I see, got it. And the $500 million or so of asset sales by '15, Andy, are we talking by the beginning of '15 or by the end of '15? ","Andres Gluski","","We really set out say a goal of around 400 this year and then we will complete the rest in '15. You think it happened for example that they do take some time as we have Cameroon close, we have done everything that we can in our share and on our side and we expect this to close sometime probably in March. So that they do take some time, there's some lag between the time that we reach an agreement. But the other thing is we are not going to do any fire sales like we haven't done and we'll sell in a manner where we really maximize the volume of those assets. And so we don't feel necessarily rush to do it. We will do it as part of our strategic plan to simplify help us cut cost, help our focus, but also taking to account there is appropriate timing to maximize the value.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","And a last question, you mentioned capital location which leads part of the go driver. You got about $190 million on your current authorization. For planning purposes should we assume that that's consumed this year or should we assume it will take longer for this to be consumed?","Andres Gluski","I really wouldn't want to comment on that I think at this stage. I think we have shown our willingness to step up as we did in December with the CIC sell down, so you can assume that but I'm not going to make any commitment in terms of whether we will use that authorization.","Ali Agha - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Fair enough. Thank you.","Ahmed Pasha","Operator, can we take one last question please.","Operator","Okay. Our last question comes from Charles Fishman. Your line is now open.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Thank you. The driver for you decision to sell the DP&L generating asset is it to the term you think you can get on the environmental CapEx going forward was unacceptable. Is that the primary driver?","Andres Gluski","I would say really it's a cost cut. It's more of a strategic because we have a -- as we transition and again we haven't taken any -- we're transitioning it out of the combined entity, but it's really a sort of a merchant position in PJM and really whether we thought that was the right bit for us.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Okay. And then if you did exit a result of those plants, would you exit the retail business as well?","Tom O'Flynn","","Well, I think that they two go hand-in-hand and the retail was really way to place our generation capacity. So certainly we would look at that.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Okay. And then you mentioned the Chilean pension, the funds I would think they like the step close to home, were they part of that $1.2 billion financing for Alto Maipo?","Tom O'Flynn","No. I mean, basically I mean, we will put it this way. No not, because of Chilean bank our involvement in the syndicate basically as we mentioned that because we see the business financing and if you really look at the growth of (inaudible) over the past six plus years, it really hasn't required any money from AES, because what we are able to do is have strategic partnerships of the local capital and so, we double the amount of capacity asset business using local financing and local equity partners. And so, that has worked very well. So what we are looking is we will do something like that because (inaudible) really seeing this financing because as you know they are not going to buy AES stock but they have to buy local paper and they very much like in there. So what we want to and this is a very important strategic trust for us is to really make use of different levels of capital to maximize the return on our equity and that means if it allows us to what we call sculpt, and that means the size of the project we may not want to take 100% of a given risk in a given market. So this allows us to reach the optimal size for our portfolio, redeploy some cash and also look at this again from a portfolio prospect. So that is the significant change in the way we've historically looked at capital here.","Ahmed Pasha","Okay. Thank you for joining us on today's call, as always the IR team will be happy to answer any additional questions you may have. Have a nice day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Angel. Good morning, and welcome to AES\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Our earnings release presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause financial results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andres Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O\u2019Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to. Andres. Andres?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our first quarter 2015 earnings call. I am pleased to report that with our first quarter results we\u2019re reaffirming our 2015 guidance for all metrics. Since our previous quarterly call less than three months ago, we have achieved several significant milestones on our strategic objectives and our priorities for 2015. We continue to leverage our platforms, our $9 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next four years.","This quarter, we commissioned the largest power plant that AES has ever constructed. We also signed agreements for two additional asset sales, totaling a $105 million in equity proceeds and invested $345 million to prepay and refinance debt. This year, we have also repurchased $42 million of our shares and we made substantial progress and addressing short-term issues affecting our businesses in Bulgaria and India.","I will discuss some of these achievements in detail. But first, I\u2019d like to provide the highlights of our financial results. In the first quarter, we generated proportional fee cash flow of $265 million doubled a results of year ago. Due to the recovery of working capital and a couple of significant businesses, we are in $0.25 of adjusted earnings per share, which was a $0.01 increase from our first quarter of 2014. We improved operating performance at our U.S. and Andes strategic business units although; we continue to experience headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil and unfavorable foreign exchange in Latin America and Europe.","During the quarter, our earnings benefited from our previous capital allocation decisions to pay down debt and buyback our shares. As we\u2019ve discussed in the past, we have taken steps to mitigate the impact of adverse hydrology in Latin America and this year that risk is mostly limited to Brazil. We also have a rolling 12 months hedging strategy to help mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies especially the Brazil real, the Colombian peso and the euro. Although these currencies have weakened against the U.S. dollar, energy demand has remained robust at 3% to 10% our markets except in the U.S., while we are experiencing flat demand and in Brazil where demand growth is slightly negative.","Now I\u2019ll discuss our significant accomplishment since our last call. Starting with our progress and resolving a couple of business specific issues beginning on slide four. In Bulgaria with the Maritza Plant sole customer, the National Electricity Company or NEK had fallen significantly behind on its payment; we\u2019re now seeing positive momentum. Last month, Maritza signed an MOU with NEK to received full payment of all arrears which as of March 30th were $236 million in exchange for a decrease in the capacity price of the long-term PPA.","We expect to sign a binding agreement by the third quarter of this year. The 14% capacity price reduction is already reflected in our 2015 guidance as well as our longer term expectations. This agreement is part of a broad set of initiatives; the Government of Bulgaria is taking to help restore NEK\u2019s financial position. One of these initiatives is the introduction of energy sector reforms to reduce the volume of energy that NEK purchases from coal generators and compensating NEK through existing environmental taxes. Already Maritza\u2019s collections during the first four months of the year have improved by 40% and our receivable balance has remained flat as of the end of December.","Turning now to our 1,320 megawatts OPGC 2 project, under construction in India on slide 5. As you may know late last year, the Supreme Court of India overturned the allocations of 214 coal blocks, including those for OPGC 2. I am pleased to report that the project through a new joint venture between OPGC and the Government of Odisha has re-secured the rights to the same coal blocks, which can support 2,640 megawatts of new capacity. Construction on OPGC 2 is on schedule with this plant expected to come online in 2018.","Now turning to slide six, I\u2019ll discuss our construction program and develop and pipeline in more detail. Our construction program is a most significant driver of our 10% to 15% average annual growth and free cash flow over the next few years. This strong growth is a foundation for a commitment to 10% annual dividend growth as well as other capital allocation decisions. From 2015 through 2018, we expect the commission 7,131 megawatts of new capacity, which is a high multiple of the roughly 600 megawatts we\u2019ve brought online in the three previous years from 2012 to 2014. In fact, already this year, we\u2019ve brought online 1,312 megawatts, which is 87% of the capacity we expect to commission this year.","Moving onto slide 7, remaining 5,118 megawatts under constructions, progressing well and remain on-time and on-budget. As a reminder, the total CapEx for our projects currently under construction is $7 billion, but AES\u2019s equity commitment is only 1.3 billion of which all but 400 million has already been funded. As you can see roughly 80% of this new capacity is in the America, we expect our return on equity from these projects of more than 15%.","Turning to slide 8, I\u2019m very happy to report that we have achieved commercial operation on our 1,240 megawatts Mong Duong project in Vietnam six months early. Additionally, the project reached 18 million man-hours without a lost time incident. This project provides us with solid platform from which to grow our presence in Vietnam where we see a number of future platform expansion opportunities.","Moving to slide 9, to help mitigate our hydrology risk in Panama we\u2019ve recently inaugurated a 72 MW thermal power barge. The plant's output is contracted under five year PBA. We're also looking at similar opportunities in other countries in Latin America to decrease our exposure to fluctuations in hydrology.","Finally, looking at our growth opportunities beyond the projects currently under construction; beginning on slide 10. We see compelling platform expansion opportunities in a number of growing markets such as Chile, Mexico, Panama and the Philippines. In more mature markets like California and the United Kingdom, we see opportunity to replace older, less efficient or noncompliant capacity. Generally, we expect our future project mix to be heavily weighted towards of natural gas, renewables, and energy storage as we seek to match the right offering on the future needs of each market. As we have said in the past we will continue to compete all investments in growth projects against share repurchases, in order to ensure that we are maximizing risk-adjusted per share returns for our shareholders. ","Based on the opportunities we see across our portfolio beyond 2018, we believe we could invest $300 million to $400 million of AES equity in the attractive growth projects each year which is consistent with the amount of equity we are currently contributing annually to our growth projects. This level of annual equity commitment is quite moderate considering the expected growth in our free cash flow and continued recycling of capital from additional asset sales.","We also plan to bring in financial partners on all of our larger projects as a means of improving our returns, fine-tuning our portfolio's risk exposures and having our project bided by other investors.","Now, I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of more significant projects in our development pipeline, beginning on slight 11. Our Southline Repowering Project in California with 1400 MW of gas-fired and energy storage capacity is on track to begin construction in 2017. We expect to select our EPC contractor and file final permitting amendments in the next six months.","Our development pipeline is not limited to power generation projects as we seek to realize the full value of our existing market platforms through adjacent business lines such as enhanced LNG services, desalinization, and energy storage.","Turning to slide 12 for example, in the Dominican Republic, we are working on opportunities to expand our existing LNG infrastructure. We are developing a second gas pipeline which would transport natural gas from our regasification terminal to other power generators so they can convert up to the 1000 MW of diesel and oil fired generations to cheaper, cleaner natural gas. We are also advancing in the development of an upgrade of our LNG import terminal to allow for the reshipment of LNG. The ability to reship LNG will be an extension of our successful gas distribution business in the Dominican Republic, which supplies third-party trucks with liquefied natural gas. Both of these attractive projects will require only modest equity investments as we expect to largely fund them with leverage capacity at the local business.","In terms of desalinization, on slide 13, we currently have one 200 cubic meter per hour project under construction at our Angamos power plant in Chile. Although this project is largely a modernization of our existing diesel facilities at that plant, there are a number of potential diesel projects in Chile to supply our mining and industrial customers. We see diesel as a timely and significant opportunity in Chile and possibly longer term in Mexico and California, given the challenges of water supply in those markets and our many years of experience operating diesel plants. ","Moving on to slide 14. We are the world leaders in battery-based energy storage 86 MW of installed capacity. Although this is likely to remain relatively small in the near term, we see the potential for much larger opportunity over the next 4 to 5 years. We are encouraged by ongoing regulatory support and growing acceptance by power systems and utilities in some of the AES' market. To that end, as you may have seen we have recently announced that we have 50 MW under construction including the first energy storage unit in the Netherlands and Northern Ireland. These projects under construction are all additions to our existing platforms. We are well-positioned to take advantage of this emerging business opportunity given AES' international portfolio in eight years of successful and profitable experience operating battery-based energy storage. ","With that I'll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results and full year guidance in more detail.","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","Thanks Andre's and good morning everyone. This quarter we continued to benefit from our capital allocation decisions in operational improvements despite some macro headwinds. Further, as anticipated, our cash flow improved as a result of lower working capital requirements. We also made substantial progress toward a key financial goal of improving our credit profile by reducing parent debt, lowering interest expense and extending maturities. ","Today, I\u2019ll review our first quarter results, including adjusted EPS, adjusted pretax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU and for the first time proportional free cash flow by SBU which we\u2019ve also included in our 10-Q. Now I\u2019ll cover our 2015 capital allocation plan and our 2015 guidance.","Turning to slide 16, first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.25 was a penny higher than first quarter 2014. At a high level, we benefited from the following. $0.03 from capital allocation which resulted in 13% lower parent debt and a 3% lower share count relative to last year and a $0.01 net increase from the performance of our businesses with improvements in the U.S. and Andes partially offset by lower contributions from Brazil, Europe and Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean or MCAC.","On the negative side, we are affected by a $0.02 impact from a stronger U.S. dollar which appreciated 18% against the Brazilian real, Colombian peso and euro any once an impact from a slightly higher tax rate of 33% this year versus 30% in the first quarter of last year. Now I\u2019ll cover our SBU\u2019s financial performance in more detail on the six slides beginning on slide 17.","In the U.S. adjusted PTC increased by 31 million driven by better availability at DPL compared to the first quarter of last year when a couple of DPL generations plants were not available during the polar vortex. Proportional free cash flow increased 74 million, reflecting a lower working capital requirements this year compared to during the extreme cold of last year. ","In Andes, PTC increased 38 million primarily due to better availability at our plants in Chile, however proportional free cash flow declined by 6 million due to timing of collections and higher maintenance capital expenditures.","In Brazil, PTC decreased 48 million driven by FX and operating performance, perhaps the decline is driven by our generation business Tiet\u00ea, you may recall that last year Tiet\u00ea benefited from spot sales at favorable prices due to lower contract levels during the first half of the year. This benefit was more of the timing issue of Tiet\u00ea at the purchase and spot market in the second half.This year Tiet\u00ea\u2019s contracts levels are flat in the first and second so we expect contributions to be evenly distributed. Additionally, Sul one of our utilities had lower results due to lower sales volume and higher fixed cost proportional free cash flow increased 15 million primarily driven by higher collections pass through energy purchases built during 2014 offset by lower operating performance. ","In MCAC, PTC declined 15 million largely driven by lower margins in the Dominican Republic, where revenues are partially indexed to oil prices as well as lower availability. This impact was partially offset by improved hydrology in Panama, proportional free cash flow improved by 55 million primarily driven by improved working capital in El Salvador and Puerto Rico. ","In Europe, adjusted PTC decreased by 30 million half which is due to lower contributions from the sales of Ebute in Nigeria and our UK win businesses, remaining half is largely from unfavorable foreign currency impacts.","Proportional free cash flow increased by 21 million driven by higher collections at Maritza which was 60% higher than the first quarter of 2014.","Finally in Asia, PTC was essentially flat after taking into account the impact from the sale of 41% of Masinloc in the third quarter of last year offset by the onetime charge recorded in the Masinloc in first quarter of \u201914 related to the market spot price adjustment. Proportional free cash flow decreased 37 million due to Masinloc sale and higher working capital requirements.","Turning to slide 23, in summary overall we earned 252 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter and an increase of 9 million from last year and we generated 265 million a proportional free cash flow, representing a doubling from 129 million in last year\u2019s first quarter. As you may recall, working capital was a drag on our results last year and as reflected in our first quarter results, we\u2019re seeing recovery.","Now to Slide 24 and our parent capital allocation plan for the year. Regarding sources on the left hand side, the only update from our last call is an increase of 100 million in equity proceeds from asset sales from the sale of the Armenia Mountain Wind project in Pennsylvania and the sale of 40% of our interest in the IPP4 Plant in Jordan. This brings our total available discretionary cash for 2015 to roughly 1.6 billion. We continue to expect parent free-cash-flow of 525 million this year with 10% to 15% average annual growth through 2018.","Turning to the uses on the right hand side of the slide, in addition to the dividend, we also plan to invest about 350 million in our subsidiaries, 60% of which is IPL and has already been funded. We\u2019ve invested 345 million in prepayment and refinancing of parent debt to balance asset sales and planned share buybacks. And finally, we repurchased 42 million of shares year-to-date and expect to invest at least 324 million this year, which assumes that we use 300 million of the 400 million we purchased, authorized in February. This leaves 200 million of discretionary cash to be allocated this year.","Turning to our parent debt profile on Slide 25. Since our last call, we prepaid 315 million of parent debt, bringing our total parent debt reduction since the end of 2011 to 1.5 billion or a 25% reduction. In early April, we also refinanced another 500 million in near term parent debt maturities. These transactions resulted in a reduction in our near term maturities to only a 180 million over the next four years and reduced the average interest rate from 6.3% to 5.6%. We also continue to optimize the capital structure of certain subsidiaries and affiliates such as Guacolda in Chile, where 830 million in long term debt was refinanced in April at about 4.5% demonstrating the strong credit quality and market access of our businesses.","Now beginning on Slide 26, I\u2019ll discuss our adjusted EPS guidance for this year, which is based on the following assumptions. Currency forward curves as of March 31st, which reflect roughly 10% appreciation versus the U.S. dollar compared to year-end curves for the Brazilian Real, Colombian Peso and the Euro, commodity forward curves as of March 31st, which reflects roughly a 5% to 10% decline for oil and gas, and the current outlook for hydro in Latin America, which is in line with our expectations except in Brazil. In the rainy season there was drawing to close and reservoir levels are currently at about 35% and are expected to be about 37% at the end of May. We believe that the government is unlikely to call for rationing this year, given these levels. ","That said, the system continues to face a hydro generation shortfall, which has a financial impact on Tiete, it previously had built a $0.05 impact into our guidance, based on having to cover 15% to 17% of our contract in the spot market. We now expect the shortfall to be 17% to 19% due to continued high thermal dispatch. We expect this will add another $0.02 to the hydro impact this year. We\u2019ve also incorporated a modest decline in demand at Sul in Brazil resulting in an incremental impact of another penny.","Now turning to Slide 27, as we discussed on our last call, our adjusted EPS guidance is $1.25 per share to $1.35 per share, which when we provided in late February was based on currency and commodity curves as of December 31st. The impact of updating these curves based on the sensitivities we\u2019ve disclosed $0.05. However, we\u2019ve been proactive in hedging our downside which reduced the FX and commodity impact by $0.03. Further as I just discussed, we\u2019re incorporating an additional $0.03 impact from poor hydrology and demand in Brazil. We\u2019ve also included a penny benefit from the completion of the Vietnam project, slightly ahead of our internal projection. Bottom-line is that although we\u2019re facing some headwinds, we\u2019re managing the impacts and therefore reaffirming our EPS guidance range. ","At the same time as you can see on Slide 27, we remain confident on our portfolio visibility to generate strong cash flow. We\u2019re affirming our proportional free cash flow guidance of 1 billion to 1.35 billion which after subsidiary debt period provides us with about 525 million in parent free cash flow. We\u2019ll continue to create value by investing in this strong and growing cash flow to maximize returns to share holders. ","With that I\u2019ll now pass it back to Andr\u00e9s. ","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thanks, Tom. To summarize, we are encouraged by the continued successful execution of our strategy and with the resilience of our platform and the opportunities that it provides increased shareholder value. As we laid out on our last call for 2015, our priorities are to pull all levers to achieve our financial objectives despite headwinds from poor hydrology in Brazil and lower foreign exchange and commodity prices, complete the 1,240-megawatt Mong Duong project in Vietnam, which will be a major contributor to our growth. We have already brought this plan online six months ahead of schedules. Resolve Maritza's outstanding receivables issue, we\u2019ve signed an MOU with NEK and expect to execute a binding agreement by the third quarter. Continued to execute on our platform expansion opportunities and bringing financial partners, we expect to have financial partners on all of our large projects. Reduced parent debt and improved our credit profile by prepaying and refinancing shorter term maturities. And as always allocate our discretionary capital in such a way as to maximize share holder returns by competing growth projects against share repurchases. ","Now, I would like to open up the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS. Your line is open. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So first quick question, more at a high level; in terms of future growth opportunities, you talked about $300 million to $400 million in equity investment potential. Where do you expect those dollars to trend towards? I suppose A, as you think about buybacks as shares at Tiete would be more in that direction? And then B, in the context of growth investment, obviously, you've heard a lot in the media around storage [indiscernible] as well as your own efforts in DG in the latest quarter. I'd be curious if you could talk to opportunities there, as well as Puerto Rico, in terms of where those respectively fit within the growth buckets?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Okay. Thanks Julien. Well, all as I said, we expect to have allocated about $300 million to $400 million to the future growth project. Of course this would be leveraged by bringing in financial partners. Now, the exact amount will depend on the projected return of those projects and value we create by buying back our shares. So, they will be competing. This is just to give us sort of the range where we see those projects. We also said that compared to what is currently under construction we see a heavier weighting towards natural gas, renewables and energy storage. ","Now, our energy storage business I think is quite different from -- and quite unique actually that we have been at this for 8 years. We make money at it. We\u2019ve been successful, and we have a product that integrates several different usage. So, we have sort of the complete package sort of plug and play. I think that\u2019s one of the reasons we were successful in Southern California bid last year. So, we see this as a growing market in the U.S. California is taking the lead by requiring utilities to have 1,325-megawatts of energy storage by 2020. And we see this trend going across the country in different place. So, again we\u2019re very well positioned to take advantage of it and we have been successful. We\u2019re also opening up new markets. In the latest ones, we\u2019re already in Chile; we\u2019re looking at Northern island and Netherland. ","So, it\u2019s one, let's say technology has three different uses. On the one hand you can use it for capacity release like we do Chile which allows you -- you don\u2019t have to hold back 5% of thermal generation because you have a battery. You can use it for ancillary services as we use it in PJM with Tiete. And you can also use it at the Peaking facility which will be the main use in California. So, the different markets, we see it developing, but we\u2019re a big company. So, to really be a needle mover we see it a couple years out. What we really want to be here is not too far ahead of the curve, but we want to be sort of somewhat ahead of the curve and that\u2019s really our strategy here and we think we\u2019re well positioned. So just like in the past when I talked about bringing in partners and said this was an idea, we\u2019ll see how this develops before giving any sort of guidance about say larger numbers of three years to five years out.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then just running here more specifically at the quarter, I suppose why not more repurchases just as what about the timing here just as you execute on the authorization this year. And then subsequently in terms of the 2015 guidance, would it be fair to say the lower half just to be clear in terms of I think there\u2019s a net $0.04 negative if you add up all those items?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Well, I\u2019d take the second question first. I think it\u2019s a little early in the year to give guidance within the guidance. We've reaffirmed all of our metrics and as you know we guide on cash flow metrics as well as earnings metrics. So again overall, we feel we had a good quarter. In terms of the amount of buybacks, we just did a major re-financings and used $345 million for that and so we\u2019re committed to use as Tom said in his speech around $300 million this year towards share repurchases and we maintain that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ali Agha from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Ali Agha","Andr\u00e9s\u00a0my first question relates to Brazil. For the last several years now it\u2019s been a source of disappointment for you and not only we\u2019re dealing with the hydro situation, but it looks like there is a upheaval or regarding the political outlook, the economic outlook at least under the current administration. I\u2019m just curious, what is your view on Brazil? Why is it still a core market for you? And wouldn\u2019t it be better for the AES platform if you would either substantially reduce or maybe even out of Brazil, given all these other growth opportunities you\u2019ve been telling us about?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I think first, I think we\u2019ve been very good sellers and managers of our portfolio. If you look at the close to $3 billion that we\u2019ve raised in our asset sales since 2011 and the prices we got out of. If you think of Brazil, I think starting in 2006, we started to reduce our position in Eletropaulo and we also spun-off the telecom and sold that as well I think right at the right timing of the market. So actually if you take a longer term perspective. I think our performance in Brazil over this period has been good. Now there\u2019s no question, that it has been affected by economics and political factors but most of the hydrology, quite frankly. So thinking about our position in Brazil, we have 2,600 megawatts of hydro in Tiete. We also have about $500 million of leverage capacity which we\u2019ve not used at Tiete, so it provides us with an opportunity. And yes, there are droughts and they are cyclical. I mean this year we\u2019re entering into mild -- actually it\u2019s been declared already a mild to medium El Nino which means going back to more sort of normal weather patterns as we\u2019ve seen in the other countries. So that will pass. ","Now politically Brazil I think it\u2019s shown on the one hand significant institutional strength given the -- as everybody is aware the issues around Petrobras and the tax authorities and the independence of the judiciary. I think they\u2019ve also named the very strong Minister of Economy Joaquim\u00a0Levy and we\u2019ve had some -- been able in some small meetings with him and seen what his plans are and we feel very encouraged by it. So I think everybody feels that 2015 will be a difficult year in Brazil. The economy is in contraction. Tom mentioned it in his comments that we see a contraction especially in Sul in terms of demand. But having said that, I think that as they take the right measures and move towards a primary surplus, Brazil is a country with a tremendous opportunity and you can\u2019t sort of come in and come out of large massive capital intensive projects like us. So you have to have a footprint there. So I think we\u2019ve reduced it appropriately and we\u2019re well positioned to look at opportunities going forward.","Ali Agha","Secondly the $200 million of cash that you have not yet allocated; can you just give us a sense of from a priority point of view, what would be the priority for that use of cash? And you talked about using up 300 million out of the 400 million of the authorization, but just curious the incremental 200 million, where do you think that\u2019s going to be spent?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Quite practical, that will depend. We\u2019ve laid out what our strategy is and what our considerations are and we have restated our commitment to buy back $300 million of shares. And so we\u2019ll see where that -- we allocated, but we\u2019re going to follow our strict capital allocation or procedures which we\u2019ve done today. But I really can't give you more color than that early.","Ali Agha","Last question, the two assets sales that you announced today. Can you just remind us or let us know, what\u2019s roughly the annual net income that goes away as a result of those sales?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","It\u2019s a modest amount Ali. The Armenia Mountain wind project was the second part of the wind that we did earlier. And that would have a relatively attractive I guess PE from our standpoint. And then the Jordan project was a partial sell-down. I think if you add them together the PE\u2019s around 13 -- so what said it is 7 million to 8 million, they got to take -- you'd flip that versus a 100.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Byrd from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to follow-up just on Julien\u2019s question on storage. You\u2019ve been very active for a number of years in storage. As you think about ways that you can monetize that advantage, do you envision that would be more in the form of continuing to win RFPs or are there ways that others might want to utilize the expertise that you\u2019ve developed either through joint ventures or effectively selling the sort of energy management capabilities you\u2019ve developed?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Thank you for the question. Today, we've basically put the energy storage units on our platform. And this has given us several advantages. First is that we knew markets well. Then we also had a ongoing dialogue with the regulator, because one of the bigger issues with energy storage is to get regulatory approval. We know the benefits that it has for stabilizing the grid, but it\u2019s a question of how you\u2019re going to get paid for sometimes for those services, if there is not a sort of active ancillary market.","So at the first steps, we put it on Chile, we put it in DP&L, we\u2019re also looking at putting on our California platforms, possibly in the future IPL and other places. But there are two steps, one is really identifying the use of the energy of the batteries and the second is getting the regulatory approval. So we see opening up markets where we\u2019re present like the Netherlands, like Northern Ireland and continue with that successful strategy.","Now in terms of how to monetize that beyond our platforms and it really would be to the situations where we could actually install the advancing product as we call it, which includes our IP, includes the batteries, includes how to operate it. In the market where we\u2019re present, we could put it on somebody else's platform. Essentially, for example let\u2019s say we\u2019re selling energy to a utility and they would like to rate these assets, we can do that as well.","So that\u2019s one way that we could grow more quickly than just let's say putting it in operating ourselves. And we\u2019re looking at -- there we\u2019re now talking to people. So again we\u2019re well positioned. We just think that, this is a market that has to develop. And one of the big challenge is again is to get the appropriate regulatory approvals and also have to demonstrate how to choose. Once you put a unit into a market and people see that it functions very well, then we expect to have an increase in demand.","So that\u2019s how we see going about it. Now, if we put it on a platform, where we have a partner, for example say in Chile, or in IPL that will participate in that asset that we\u2019re putting on. And we really managing from a center of excellence here at Corp, but pushing out the implementations into the businesses.","So again you know this has worked very well. And we think this is an idea of whose time has come. But we see that the U.S. market is most immediate one. We see this is going -- and works particularly well for example on smaller grids islands and we\u2019re located in a lot of islands and smaller grids, from the Philippines to Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Northern Ireland, Dominican Republic. There are a lot of places you can use it or places for example like Chile which due to the nature of the grid look like islands. You have certain constraints. So for all those reasons again we\u2019re optimistic where we think we\u2019re in the leading edge and we\u2019ll continue to push this product forward in numerous markets.","Stephen Byrd","That\u2019s very helpful color. I wanted to shift over to renewables growth. We're seeing, and I guess, what I perceive as some fairly aggressive competitors in the marketplace with -- many with yield of course. Could you just talk at a high level to the degree of competition you are seeing either for -- just on an absolute return level, or in terms of just business developments? Are you seeing a change at all, in terms of competition? Or do you feel that, given how long you have been in your core markets, you still see numerous advantages for AES, as you look at renewables growth? ","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, I think you said it right. The big advantage we have is putting among to our existing businesses and understanding these markets. And I think that we\u2019ve seen situations for example at certain time say wind in Brazil, where prices were very expensive, competition was very aggressive; and I think we\u2019re very judicious about where to put our money in. Now we\u2019ve sold part of our joint venture Silver Ridge to people who have impressive global plans for utility scale solar. And we did in part, because it\u2019s not on our strategy of using our platforms. We are much more efficient, maybe you take all in costs which at the end of the day that\u2019s what matters from development to operating, these plans, even financing and rather than doing sort of one-by-one project financings, really doing at under the umbrella of an existing business.","So for example in Chile which is a very competitive market and it had about a 1000 megawatts of renewables that are coming on the grid. We\u2019re building out the 20 megwatt solar. We have permits up to 200. And we\u2019ll do it to the degree that we get PPAs. Of course, the issues with solar, that you only have energy 8 to 10 hours a day. So having the backup of an existing facility gives us a lot more levy in terms of what we can put together.","And also technologically we can combine this as we do in Laurel Mountain, where we combined wind with energy storage. This makes a more attractive offering. So really that\u2019s our strategies to put it together. Not to compete just on low returns for this project in many of the markets. And our strategy to date in terms of getting lower cost capital is really been in the partnerships and bringing on partners. And I think we\u2019ve been quite effective in that to date. We have over $2.5 billion that we have raised which is quite a lot of money if you consider it in terms of increasing our ability to larger projects, our ability to fine-tune what our exposure is. And so we\u2019ll continue to use that in renewables as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon","Tom, the $0.01 of operating performance improvement you had in the quarter. You don\u2019t have a commensurate assumed increase or decrease in earnings within the $1.25 to $1.35 guidance range associated with operating performances. Is that because sort of quarter specific, or is it just too early in the year to know how much you\u2019re going to sort of gain from that as you annualizes the things you did in the first quarter?","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","It\u2019s probably a little early Greg and obviously there is a lot of moving parts. We call that few, not all. I think the one thing that does jump out was DPL. It had improved performance. We didn\u2019t have to pull out what\u2019s actually, that was one thing that jumped off.","Greg Gordon","And then at what point during the year -- if you start to see yourselves potentially towards the midpoint or high-end of guidance, or sort of midpoint or low-end of guidance; do you pull the trigger on capital allocation on that 200 million that remains. Because obviously further in the year, you go, under a scenario where you\u2019re getting behind and it's sort of too late to pull that lever. And in the flip side being, if you\u2019re doing fine, you want to find out -- probably want to hold that money back and think more flexibly about it. So in the context of where you are, how you think things are trending, when do you think we\u2019re getting update on that? ","Thomas O\u2019Flynn","We\u2019ll certainly do it quarter-to-quarter, we try to look ahead here and that\u2019s what we felt very comfortable saying that we do 300 million of the 400 million that we authorized a couple of months ago, that would bring our share repurchase up to 3 and 340 whatever it would be. So, we\u2019ll do it quarter-by-quarter. Also keep in my mind to the extend we see capital allocation opportunities, let\u2019s say in early 2016 we may end up '15 with a higher balance than just working capital would require. So, we do look at this hard. We do compete all projects, all businesses whether it be a small storage or whether it be larger new build, we compete everything against share repurchase and we\u2019ll continue to do that and keep you posted. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Turnure from JPMorgan. Your line is opened. ","Chris Turnure ","I wanted to get an update on California re-powering. You guys were obviously successful there, back in the fall, with both the gas units and the storage. But could you give us some color here, on the potential for future gas projects there and storage, as well, to some degree, and timing and next milestones around those?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","I would say, of course additional gas units have to based on sort of RFBs and bids, which if they come we still have the capacity to compete on those but really have nothing to report there. In terms of energy storage as I said California has a goal of 1,325 megawatts. Our commitment southern California I think is 100 megawatts, so there is a lot of room there for more. So, we really have to see. But you know it\u2019s 2020. We will be very active in California seeking to increase our footprint there and to the measure that we get, we on additional bids; of course we\u2019ll keep you informed. So, I think short term, certainly energy storage I see significant possibilities for growth in California for the next couple of years. ","Chris Turnure ","And then going back to the re-securing of coal in India, and that's four projects, so it's not going to be online for a while. Could you talk to how the re-contracted situation compares to the original deal that you had, in terms of your growth plans? And if this is going to materially negatively affect any future projects that you were contemplating there? ","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Not really, there was this scandal, say in India, we call Coal Gate and when they looked at the coal allocations, we weren\u2019t involved in any way in it. But they cancelled all 214 coal allocation [audio gap] OPGC has entered into a joint venture with the state government of Orissa. So, it's really JV of our JV, and so our holdings in this company will be like 25%; that would be the operator of the mine. No, we don\u2019t see any issues at this time. It\u2019s the same two coal blocks. It\u2019s the same amount of 2,640 megawatts. So, it would support OPGC2 and could support, and again we\u2019re not -- there is nothing specific. But it could support OPGC3. And we see nothing negative at this stage from the reallocation of the coal and the construction of the plant is proceeding according to plan. So, again, we sort of -- the plant was proceeding and as we straightened out the coal allocation issue, so, we\u2019re back to where we were at the beginning. Actually the one difference is that it\u2019s -- this joint venture is with the state government of Orissa. ","Chris Turnure ","Okay. And then regarding future expansion in India, the economics have not meaningfully changed for any projects versus what you were thinking before. ","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Nothing is changed to date. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Orrill from Barclays. Your line is open.","Greg Orrill","So you reaffirmed the multi-year earnings guidance. You had some impacts in the quarter around in 2015 around the sensitivities that you were able to offset to some extent with hedging. As you look forward into 2016 and beyond, do you feel like these things you have to offset that or capital allocation and operations or maybe other things, other investments to offset those the negative move from sensitivities, so do you feel like you\u2019re kind of in the same place?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes, I\u2019d tell you again. We have nothing really new to report at this time. And as you sort of pointed out that sensitivities move, I mean certain FX and some of the commodities have actually improved since the closing date of March 30th, in the last couple of weeks, there\u2019s been some strengthening of the currencies to help offset some of that. What we would see as you say operational improvements, some of the projects, shorter term projects, some of the sort of energy storage that we put online this year can come on by 2016; also if we do any additional fogging, which also increases megawatts at a very low cost. For us things like the in-and-out terminal; basically the ability to re-export LNG from the Dominican Republic that maybe late sort of 2016; so those are mainly the things that we see at present. And of course capital allocation would be another tool that we have.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Charles Fishman from Morningstar. Your line is opened.","Charles Fishman","First, congratulations to your contract at Mong Duong; that safety record is phenomenal. And second -- the only question I had left was on Slide 24, I just wanted to confirm on that the third bullet point about the 214 million from your partner IPALCO, the Canadian partner. That\u2019s not an increase in their equity piece, that\u2019s just consistent timing with respect to your original announcement of their equity contribution in IPALCO, correct?","Andres Ricardo Gluski Weilert","Yes. That\u2019s correct. And thank you for mentioning the sort of safety record at Mong Duong. We\u2019re very proud of that and we do have a sort of lot of visitors who come to see us, how we were able to accomplish that in Vietnam.","Charles Fishman","Somebody that started out in the construction business; so I can tell you that that safety record is really strong.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Ahmed Pasha, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Ahmed Pasha","Thank you, Dan. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter financial review call. Our press release, presentation and related financial information are available on our website at aes.com. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements during the call. There are many factors that may cause future results to differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors.","Joining me this morning are Andr\u00e9s Gluski, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Tom O'Flynn, our Chief Financial Officer; and other senior members of our management team. With that, I will now turn the call over to Andr\u00e9s. Andr\u00e9s?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks you, Ahmed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review call. Today, I will discuss our first quarter results and provide updates on our progress and our strategic objectives, macro conditions in our markets, and construction and development program.","Since our last call in late February, we have achieved a number of key objectives for 2016. We received payment of all outstanding receivables in Bulgaria. We are on track to achieve our three-year $150 million cost reduction and revenue enhancement goals. We saw improvements in our credit ratings and outlook from the rating agencies. Our $7.5 billion construction program is advancing on schedule and will be the major contributor to our cash and earnings growth over the next three years.","We continue to leverage our existing business platforms by advancing projects with long-term contracts denominated in U.S. dollars. During the first quarter, we achieved significant milestones on three new projects, which will contribute to our growth after 2018. I\u2019ll discuss these achievements in more detail in the movement. But I would like to summarize our financial results on slide four.","In the first quarter, we generated proportional free cash flow of $253 million, in line with last year. The recent collection of $350 million in Bulgaria will be reflected in our second quarter cash flow. Our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.13, which is considerably lower than the $0.25, we earned last year. Our first quarter operating performance was impacted by adverse movements in FX, lower power prices in the U.S. and the expiration of the power purchase agreement at Tiet\u00ea in Brazil.","Our earnings performance was also driven by a tax rate of 50% for the first quarter, which is really a timing issue. We continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate for the full year. In terms of our outlook for the full year, we\u2019re reaffirming our guidance on all financial metrics. Nonetheless, we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, due to the continuing impact from the factors I just mentioned and scheduled major maintenance in the second quarter. ","Now, I\u2019ll turn to our strategic accomplishments since our last call. As you can see on slide five, we have successfully resolved the outstanding receivables issue at Maritza in Bulgaria. Maritza\u2019s sole customer, the National Electricity Company, or NEK has fallen significantly behind on its payments. In April, we received full payment of the outstanding receivables of $350 million. This is a direct result of the steps taken by the government of Bulgaria to strengthen the financial position of NEK and the long-term sustainability of the energy sector. By meeting all of its contractual obligations, Bulgaria is sending a very positive signal to all foreign investors. Currently, Maritza is providing critically needed power to the Bulgarian electric grid, and we have been collecting in a timely manner, since December 2015.","Turning now to slide six and our cost savings and revenue enhancement initiative. Our goal is to achieve a run rate of $150 million per year in bottom line improvement. We are on track to achieve our $50 million goal for 2016 and the additional $100 million to 2018. These bottom line benefits are largely driven by global procurement efforts, moving back office functions to lower cost service centers in Argentina and Bulgaria, and continued improvement in our performance of our plants.","Now turning to slide seven, I\u2019ll discuss macro conditions in our markets. First, the impact from hydrology in Latin America should be negligible this year. While cumulative rainfall remains below average in Panama, it is generally improved in the rest of Latin America. Regarding Panama, spot prices have fallen significantly, as a result of the barge based power plant we commissioned there last year, which reduced the effects of low rainfall on our contracted hydro plants. Second, economic conditions in our markets are generally in line with prior expectations, except for Brazil, which is experiencing a deepening recession. At our distribution businesses in Brazil, we are announcing a second consecutive year of 5% decline in demand. While in the U.S. demand is essentially flat, in most of our other markets we continue to see energy demand growth in the range of 4% to 10%.","Moving on to slide eight, we are focusing our investment efforts on platform expansion projects with long-term contracts and U.S. dollar denominated revenues. We see a significant opportunity to take a leading role in the distribution and storage of LNG in Central America and the Caribbean.","Turning to slide nine, let us review our major new projects. During the quarter, we started construction on the 335-megawatt Masinloc expansion to take advantage of robust growth in the Philippines and our existing infrastructure. The new unit, Masinloc 2 will be one of the most competitive thermal plants in the country employing highly efficient and flexible super critical technology. The $740 million project will be funded by a combination of non-recourse financing, partner equity and cash generated at the Masinloc 1 for facility.","Moving on to slide 10, I am pleased to report that we have achieved a number of milestones on our Colon project in Panama. This project encompasses both, 380-megawatt combined cycle plant or CCGT and an adjacent LNG regasification terminal and storage facility. The CCGT is contracted under 10-year U.S. dollars denominated PPA. The LNG facility will have an 180,000 cubic-meter tank, which is sufficient to handle 80 Tera Btu annually. Our CCGT will use about 1 quarter of the tank\u2019s capacity leaving substantial unused capacity to meet the needs of additional power plants for downstream customers.","The Colon project seeks to replicate the success of our LNG facilities in the Dominican Republic, which provides gas to our adjacent power plant, another power plant via pipeline and to numerous downstream customers in the transportation and industrial sectors. The Colon project is strategically located near the entrance of Panama Canal and will be able to offer bunkering to the maritime industry as it starts to use natural gas as a fuel. There are many commercial synergies between the LNG terminal in the Dominican Republic and Panama. And with both facilities in service, we will become the largest provider of LNG regasification and storage services in Central America and the Caribbean.","All the Colon projects permits are in place, and we have selected the EPC contractor. Project financing for approximately 60% of the project cost is well underway. AES\u2019s equity is expected to be around $200 million, which we will fund over the construction period. The project is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016 with completion of the power plant in 2018 and the LNG facility in 2019.","As we can see on slide 11, the repowering of Southland in California is another example of a large project that will contribute to our growth beyond 2018. As a reminder, we were awarded a 20-year PPA by Southern California Edison for 1,384 megawatts of capacity, which includes 100 megawatts of energy storage and 1,284 megawatts of combined cycle gas capacity. Since our last call, we have signed turbine supply agreement and EPC contracts to build the CCGT. We are making good progress on the remaining regulatory approval and expect to break ground in 2017 with completions in 2020. We anticipate funding the $2 billion total project cost with a combination of non-recourse debt and $500 million in equity from AES and a possible financial partner.","Turning to slide 12, we remain optimistic on the future battery-based energy storage and our leadership position in this market. We currently have 116 megawatts of energy storage projects in operations across four countries and expect to install another 50 megawatts this year. Additionally, we have another 228 megawatts in advanced stage development, including the 100 megawatts under contract in California. By 2017, we expect to be operating in seven countries, adding India, the Philippines, and the Dominican Republic to the four countries where we already operate, the U.S., the UK, the Netherland and Chile.","We see growth in our energy storage business through two paths: AES owned projects, such as the previously discussed 100 megawatts with a PPA with Southern California Edison; and sales of our Advancion energy storage solutions by AES and our channel partners. These sales will target utilities and other large energy storage customers.","First, regarding long-term contracts, we see significant potential in many of our markets including the U.S., the UK, the Philippines and Mexico. We continue to work with local regulators to facilitate the development of market structures that enable new investments in battery-based energy storage. Second, over the past eight years, we have learned a tremendous amount about how to integrate the various components to create a proprietary battery-based energy storage solution, which we have named Advancion.","To promote Advancion sales in many more markets, we have executed channel partner agreements with Mitsubishi for sales in Asia and with Eaton for sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. We are in discussions with other potential partners to sell Advancion in additional markets. Although battery-based energy storage is still early on its private cycle, we believe that Advancion presents an interesting opportunity for upside in our cash and earnings forecast.","Turning now to our projects under construction on slide 13. Our ongoing construction program is a most significant driver of our growth over the next few years. We expect to commission 6 gigawatts of new capacity from projects currently under construction through the first half of 2019. As a remainder, total capital expenditure for this project is $7.5 billion. However, by using financial partners, AES's equity commitment is reduced to $1.3 billion. AES's equity commitment all but $160 million has already been funded. As you can see on slide 13, roughly 74% of our investments are in Americas, and of this, a maturity is in the U.S. and Chile. We expect an average return on equity from these projects of approximately 15%. About 3-gigawatt representing half of the capacity currently under construction are 90% complete and our on track to come on line, on time and on budget this year. In 2017, we plan to commission an additional 670 megawatts of capacity in the U.S. and 112 megawatts in the Dominican Republic. We have completed about 70% of the work on these two projects, and we also expect them to come on line, on time and on budget.","The remaining three major projects now under construction, Masinloc 2, OPGC 2, and Alto Maipo all projected to come on line in late 2018 and early 2019. This construction program will drive visible and attractive growth in both free cash flow and earnings. As you can see on slide 14, we expect at least 10% annual growth in proportional free cash flow through 2018, which will support our 10% annual growth in dividend, continued deleveraging of the parent and subsidiaries and investments in attractive platform expansions.","Turning now to slide 15, we also see robust growth in earnings through 2018. From 2016 to 2018, we expect an attractive growth rate of 12% to 16% in our adjusted EPS. Approximately 5% of this annual growth rate is driven by cost reductions and revenue enhancements. Another 8% to10% of expected growth is driven by the 2.4 gigawatts of construction projects coming on line in 2017 and 2018. Based on our strong market position in attractive high growth markets, we are optimistic about our ability to drive growth beyond 2018. The three projects I just discussed, Masinloc 2; Colon; and Southland will come fully on line after 2018.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tom to discuss our first quarter results, capital allocation, and full year guidance in more detail.","Tom O'Flynn","Thanks Andr\u00e9s. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review our first quarter results including adjusted EPS, proportional free cash flow, and adjusted pre-tax contribution or PTC by strategic business unit or SBU, and I'll cover our 2016 capital allocation, as well as our 2016 guidance.","Turning to slide 17, first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.13 was $0.12 lower than 2015. Much of this decline was driven by factors incorporated into our full guidance, certain exceptions, primarily the decline in power markets in the U.S. as well as lower demand in Brazil. Specifically our results reflect the $0.04 impact from a significantly higher quarterly tax rate of 50% in 2016 versus 33% in \u201815. This was mostly driven by the timing of certain tax expenses, the largest of which was the enactment of income tax reforms in Chile. We do expect the rate to recover during the year to full year tax rate of 31% to 33%.","Next, the $0.04 impact from devaluation of foreign currency is expected primarily in Latin America and Europe. And also $0.05 lower contributions from SUBs mainly due to anticipated drivers such as the expiration of Tiet\u00ea\u2019s PPA with Eletropaulo. In addition to the drivers included in our expectations, we also saw some softness in power markets and mild weather in the U.S. That being said, we\u2019ve seen some recovery in prices in the last month, which will contribute to our stronger second half of the year and helps give us comfort in our full year outlook.","Now on slide 18, our overall results were primarily driven by lower margins in our Brazil, Europe and U.S. SBUs due to factors I just mentioned. Generated $253 million in proportional free cash flow, a modest decrease of $12 million from last year reflecting lower margins, mostly offset by higher collections at our Brazil utilities and lower working capital requirements in Vietnam. We also earned $172 million in adjusted PTC during the quarter, a decrease of $80 million.","Now, I\u2019ll cover our SBUs in more detail over the next six slides, beginning on slide 19. In the U.S., our results reflect lower margins at DPL, due to lower wholesale prices and lower contributions from regulated customers; lower contributions from IPL due to mild weather and the partial sell-down and the sale of our Armenia Mountain wind project. Proportional free cash flow also reflects unfavorable working capital changes at IPL.","In Andes, our results reflect the 40% devaluation of the Argentine peso, 24% deval of the Colombian peso and lower volumes at Chivor in Colombia. Proportional free cash flow was also impacted by higher tax payments in Chile. PTC also reflects lower equity in earnings at Guacolda in Chile. In Brazil, our results reflect lower margins to the expiration of Tiet\u00ea\u2019s PPA with Eletropaulo in 2015; lower demand at Sul and Eletropaulo and the 26% devaluation of the Brazilian real. Proportional free cash flow also reflects higher collections at Sul and Eletropaulo, as well as a favorable timing of energy purchases at Tiet\u00ea.","Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, our results reflect modestly lower margins. Proportional free cash flow largely reflects higher than normal collections in the Dominican Republic in 2015. In Europe, our results reflect lower margins due to the 48% devaluation of the Kazakhstan Tenge and lower dark spreads at Kilroot in the UK. Proportional free cash flow also reflects the timing of payments to the fuel supplier at Maritza in Bulgaria and the unfavorable timing of working capital and tax payments in the UK.","Finally, in Asia, our results benefited from higher margins and lower build up of working capital, as a result of start up operations at Mong Duong in Vietnam in April of 2015.","Turning to slide 25, I\u2019ll now provide an update on a regulatory filing at DPL and Ohio. As you may recall, in February, DPL filed its electric security plan. Since that time, there have been challenges to regulation in Ohio. We saw the potential for similar arguments to impact the structure of other utilities proposals pending before the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Consequently, when we filed our plan, we included an alternative proposal that provided an option for the PUCO to approve a non-bypassable charge structured in the same way as the one approved in our existing ESP. We believe that this alternative falls under PUCO\u2019s authority and also achieves the policy goals set out by the Commission. We continue to believe this alternative provides a viable path forward for DPL and Ohio and that Commission is seeking for reasonable resolution matter before the end of this year.","Turning now to our 2016 capital allocation on slide 26. Sources on left hand side continue to reflect $1.1 billion of total available discretionary cash, which includes $575 million in parent free cash flow and announced asset sales. We remain confident in our 2016 parent free cash flow range of $525 million to $625 million, which is the foundation of our discretionary cash available for dividend growth and value creation.","Turning to uses on the right hand side of the slide, consistent with our capital allocation plan that we showed during our last call. The 10% growth in our dividend and share repurchases year-to-date, were returning at least a third of this cash to share holders. Going forward, we see our dividend as the primary means to distribute cash to shareholders. Stock repurchases should be less material, absent proceeds from additional asset sales and partnerships.","Regarding debt reduction, we\u2019re making good progress on our $200 million target for the year, in our longer term goal of parent credit improvement. In fact, year-to-date, we\u2019ve prepaid a $125 million parent debt. Taking advantage of weak market conditions early in the quarter, we were able to buy this debt at a 7% discount. We\u2019re also seeing positive momentum on the ratings front. In March, Moody\u2019s changed our parent credit outlook from stable to positive; and in April, S&P upgraded our ratings from BB minus to BB. These actions reflect our continued efforts to derisk our portfolio and improve our credit metrics.","We think that continuing to strengthen our credit will help us get better recognition and valuation for a growing cash flow and dividend. This positive credit trend along with an overall mark improvement has allowed us to continue to be opportunistic regarding refinancing and extending maturities. To that end, last week, we extended our $800 million parent revolver maturity from 2018 to 2021. Also last week on the non-recourse side, our business in the Dominican Republic was able to replace a short-term financing with a new $370 million, 10-year bond at more favorable terms.","We\u2019ve also earmarked $330 million for investments in our subsidiaries, about a third of which is for our Colon project in Panama at Southland in California, coming on line after 2018. Finally, after considering these in our subs, our current dividend and debt prepayment, were left with roughly $150 million discretionary cash, which we\u2019ll invest consistent with our capital allocation framework. As in years past, much of this cash is weighted towards the latter part of the year.","Now to slide 27, we are reaffirming our guidance and 2017-18 expectations for all metrics, based on foreign currency and commodity forward curves as of April 30th. We continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be relatively evenly distributed in the first and second half of the year. And with the settlement of all outstanding receivables at Maritza, we expect our first half proportional free cash flow to be well ahead of last year\u2019s.","Regarding adjusted EPS, consistent with the first quarter, we also except the second quarter to be lower than normal. In fact, we are forecasting that 70% to 75% of our 2016 adjusted EPS to be recorded in the second half of 2016 versus about 60% in past years.","There are few reasons that our results will be strong in the second half than first half. First, we expect a lower tax rate in the next few quarters. In any given year, there are certain items that influence quarterly rate tend to normalize on a full year basis. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we recognized a higher than usual tax expense, which when combined with relatively low first quarter earnings and at an outsized impact on our tax rate for the quarter. This tax expense was anticipated in our guidance and accordingly, we continue to expect a 31% to 33% tax rate in 2016. Second, the higher concentration of scheduled maintenance in the first half of the year will position us for stronger performance in second half, for example, San Nicolas plant in Argentina will undergo plant major maintenance entire second quarter, as part of its regular maintenance cycle that occurs about every eight years. Few of our other plants have similar circumstances. Third, forward curves for FX and commodities reflect some improvement over the balance of the year, which will provide a benefit in second half. Fourth, this year\u2019s $50 million cost reduction is more heavily weighted towards the second half. And lastly, we expect to benefit from a couple of items that we are working on to partially offset lower demand in Brazil and lower power prices in the U.S., be in a better position to discuss these later in the year. ","With that I'll now turn it back over to Andr\u00e9s.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Thanks Tom. To summarize our views on this call, we continue to generate strong proportional free cash flow, which will be evenly distributed between the first and second half of the year. Although we expect our first half adjusted EPS to be relatively weak, many of the negative drivers will reverse in the second half and therefore we are reaffirming our guidance for all financial metrics.","In terms of our strategic priorities, in the first few months of this year, we have made significant progress, including resolving the outstanding receivables issue in Bulgaria, receiving positive actions from the rating agencies resulting from our actions to de-risk the portfolio and de-lever the parent, reaffirming our double-digit growth through 2018 in both cash flow and earnings, driven by a largely funded construction program and $150 million in cost savings and revenue enhancements, and achieving significant milestones on three new projects in our development pipeline, to drive growth beyond 2018.","I am optimistic about the future of AES. We are delivering strong and growing free cash flow, which we will continue to use to maximize risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The 6 gigawatts we currently have under construction is the largest driver of our expected growth of at least 10% in free cash flow through 2018. Beyond 2018, we are well-positioned to capture new opportunities due to our strong business platforms in attractive and growing market, and our leadership position in deploying new technologies.","Now, I'd like open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ali Agha of SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Ali Agha","The first question, Tom, you alluded to the fact that while the tax rate and FX drivers in the first quarter were pretty much on plan, the U.S. and Brazil results were somewhat below plan. Could quantify how much below plan from an earnings perspective Q1 ended up?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes. I think if you single out those two, it\u2019s probably $0.03 to $0.04 probably split between them, probably about $0.04 equally split.","Ali Agha","And you alluded to some offsets in the second half; would they be cost reduction related initiatives or what would be offsetting them in the second half?","Tom O'Flynn","Truly list that one through recently cost reductions, a part of the $50 million we are expecting to get as part of our savings plan is more heavily weighted, but truly all the things.","Ali Agha","I was talking about that last bucket line, which you had mentioned in those lists of things which were not really listed in more detail, you said more to come on that.","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, those will likely be in the second half, the things that -- two things of particular that we are working on to offset these issues and certainly not appropriate to give a lot of color on it, at this point, which I appreciate, people like get more color but we expect to give more color as they materialize in the second half of the year.","Ali Agha","Yes. Separately, where do we stand on the Sul, transaction and what's the timing we should be expecting on that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","As we said last time, we injected $75 million into Sul, we restructured the debt, and we are looking at all options now for Sul. At this point, I really can't comment anymore about that.","Ali Agha","Okay. And lastly, on Ohio, Andr\u00e9s, as you mentioned the non-bypassable, you feel, keeps you out of the FERC review, but that still would keep the volatility of that business around. The beauty of the PPA was that it would take volatility out. I am wondering, have you looked at some of the recent filings that some folks have gone back in to try to keep FERC out and yet also keep volatility out or those would be of interest to you? And separately, if non-bypassable is the only way to go here, would you come back to the notion of potentially selling those assets again to get out of the commodity-exposed business there?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I would say that, again, we believe that our proposal avoided some of the issues raised by the PPAs. We continue to feel that that\u2019s the correct path to go and we feel optimistic. We feel it's in everybody's interest. So, at this point what we would like to do is we continue to go with that path. And you are correct that there is a certain amount of volatility due to the on contract nature of the generation assets at DP&L, [ph] which is separate from that. But we have to -- especially if we get the non-liability rider, we have to think of it as an integrated business at that point.","Ali Agha","But these other filings that I think FE and others may have made in response, would any of those be of interest to you?","Ahmed Pasha","Yes, Ali, what we have filed is not much different, what they have filed as a new case, if you wish, because we filed is not -- if you look at our plan A, which is not much different what FE has recently filed.","Ali Agha","Okay, we would talk more of that offline. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Perhaps, just starting where Ali left off, can you remind us just what the benefit embedded in Ohio is of continuation of the ESP structure et cetera, or whatever structure ultimately is approved there in guidance?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Given a wide range in our guidance I think, so what we have embedded in there I think is a reasonable amount going forward. But as we say, we do have somewhat of a wide range to this. And that\u2019s -- I don\u2019t Tom, would you like to add anything to that?","Tom O'Flynn","I think, Julien we have said before, we\u2019re obviously in the middle of our filing and working through it. So, we are careful about too much detail here. But I think we said before we have got a 110 now on in our ESP. We have incorporated something and it will be less than that amount into our \u201817 and beyond numbers. But, it's still a meaningful number, but it's certainly less than what we currently get.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then turning to the Chilean tax rate change, obviously it's a first quarter item, but as you think about it more structurally, what is that impact in \u201817, \u201818 et cetera, just on an ongoing basis?","Tom O'Flynn","It's nothing. We headed into our guidance; it was unclear when the final legislation would be final, final, so be recognized. So, it's about $0.03 to $0.04; we fully expected it in our guidance for \u201816. It's just happen to fall in the first quarter because this final, final in Chile. What is it, it\u2019s revaluation deferred taxes, the tax rate goes up slightly; so, it's a modest revaluation of deferred taxes. It's similar to what we did two years ago, I believe, \u201814, I think it was Q3 of \u201814 as I recall. It\u2019s a similar deal. So, this is a second phase of that same legislation that came in shortly after President Bachelet took office.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then turning to the asset sales, obviously you were very active in the first quarter here; kind of hit your annual targets already. Can you comment more broadly, I forget talking about specifics like Sul, but ambitions to continue to pursue equity sale downs? And also if you think about the ratio of buyback versus asset sales proceeds, should we assume for the most part they\u2019re going to be earnings neutral for the course of what you\u2019ve announced already and then prospectively?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We have announced in the past that we would be selling likely on average of $200 million to $300 million in equity proceeds to us of sale downs and getting out of certain businesses. And we continue. I think we\u2019ve quite frankly outperformed the numbers that we have given in the past. Now, we don\u2019t comment on them. But, what we would be doing again is fine tuning our portfolio to have really sort of an optimal mix, optimal mix of risks and position. So, we will continue to do that. And in terms of what we do with the proceeds, we\u2019ll continue to allocate them as we have in terms of a mix, whether it\u2019d be new investments and debt pay downs. And we\u2019ll see what the circumstances are. As Tom said, I think it\u2019s more of a -- we\u2019ll have more of an emphasis on the growth of dividend than we\u2019ve had in the past.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But give that you\u2019re at seemingly the midpoint of that 200 million, 300 million, you\u2019re saying that you\u2019ve outperformed, so you wouldn\u2019t necessary rule out further asset sales clearly?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, absolutely not, absolutely not.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And what is the earnings contribution loss from the asset sales seen thus far?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We have in our forecast through 2018, we have modest decrease in earnings from those sales, because first you never can deploy the cash immediately, and it depends on the assets you\u2019re selling, its risk profile, whether it\u2019d be accretive or dilute.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Turnure of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Chris Turnure","I appreciate that you don\u2019t want to give us too much detail on the Sul transaction or the potential of Sul transaction, but would you be able to give us, maybe the trailing 12-month EBITDA contribution from that business or PTC and then tell us how much debt is associated with that asset right now?","Tom O'Flynn","The PTC contribution from Sul is -- it\u2019s modest, to be honest, it was a modest negative in the first quarter of the year. And last year, it was probably a couple of pennies of PTC, but it was -- right now, the way Sul is running, it\u2019s a negative PTC. In terms of debt, we had -- it\u2019s about $275, $300, around $300 under the exchange rates, roughly in my head when we paid it down, we got it down to about 275 in dollars. ","Chris Turnure","The debt is in reis?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, the debt in reis is obviously, I\u2019m doing the math in dollars; but call it $275, $300; it\u2019s all in reis, so call it then 1,100, 1,200. ","Chris Turnure","And you\u2019re done with the recapitalization of that asset as of now?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, we put in 300 million reis, shortly after our last call paid down some debt, and we get covenants in that part of significant amount of time. Yes.","Chris Turnure","And then my second question is about kind of I guess 2019 and beyond. I\u2019m wondering, one, when we would potentially get more color on earnings that year in cash flow that year, and kind of terms of your overall growth rate and what that would mean specifically? And then I also wanted to understand, within I guess that question, the contracting structure of some of your success here on the LNG side. You have clearly at least in Panama one particular power plant where you have a 10-year contract. So, I guess I understand that. But, then how do you guys think about the risk and the structure of the actual importing of the LNG and the regas there and the selling of that to third parties?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Okay. We tend to give our longer term forecast in February of -- so that will be in next year when we sort of move out an additional. What we wanted to do was give your color that our growth will continue post 2018 and fact that we have a good pipeline through 2020 that we recently added to. So that was really the point of this call.","Now, talking about the facility in Panama, Colon facility, so it has two parts, as you said, one the 380-megawatt combined cycle gas plant, with a ten year PPA with the credibility offtaker in dollars; and the second is a tank. And the tank, we\u2019re using about a quarter of the capacity for this plant. This leads about three quarters. So, it\u2019s really a question of tolling; we are not going to be taking commodity risk on this. So, this could be tolling fuel for other power plants. We did this in the Dominican Republic, we\u2019re using it. We\u2019ve built a pipeline to the -- our own actually DPP facility and converted from diesel to natural gas. And we\u2019re selling it there to the transportation and industrial sectors. So, what we would have in Panama is first to meet domestic demand; there are power plants nearby, the other power plants that will be built that will require natural gas, so that\u2019s first use. Transportation and industrial use would be second, following the model we had in Dominican Republic. And third which is very interesting is the ship bunkering. We would not be doing the bunkering; we would actually have somebody else do that, but they would use our storage and regas capacity.","So, the way to think about this is you basically bring in large efficient, LNG tankers, you unload them in Panama and Dominican Republic and then you have various means of delivering gas to various kinds of customers or actually LNG as well.","So, we do not plan to take any commodity per se on these transactions. We\u2019d be providing a service, regasification service, a bunkering service and a hub service. And between the two, this gives us a very attractive position to be able to service people who want services in Panama and the Dominican Republic.","Chris Turnure","That\u2019s very clear. It sounds like this would be within your risk tolerance or your risk profile of contracted assets, kind of at least medium term in duration and beyond with no commodity risk?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. And with some of the people who would be using these tanks, we would expect to have contracts as well, basically assuring a certain amount of capacity from our tanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Angie Storozynski","My first question is so, this Panama CCGT, you mentioned it's going to start operations in \u201818. Did you have it previously in your earnings expectations for \u201818; and if that's what's actually causing the guidance to move towards the high end, the percentage wise? That's one. And two, could you comment, if you have any earnings contributions for Sul and Eletropaulo in your guidance in \u201817 and \u201818?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","So, I'll take the first. No, this was not in our guidance previously. Now, realize that the power plant will come on line late in \u201818, so really won't have any effect on \u201818, it\u2019s really \u201819 forward. And the storage tank will become fully operational in \u201819. So, this is outside the window that we have given in the past. Regarding -- I think Tom can talk about the contributions of Sul and EP.","Tom O'Flynn","Yes, just to put a fine point, I think Sul has been running at loss and it\u2019s been running at loss really since middle of last year. So, last year, it was down about 20 million to 25 million PTC and this year, we\u2019re forecasting similar numbers. As we look at Sul, the earnings are -- we don\u2019t have Sul in our forecast for \u201817, and inflection point for Sul will be their rate, the next rate case, rate adjustment mechanism, which is in spring of \u201818, that\u2019s if we were to retain the business. In terms of Eletropaulo, the earnings were also very modest. We do have Eletropaulo, we do continue to have it in our business but its contributions are between $0.00 and $0.02, depending upon your forecast for Brazil. So, it's fairly modest number.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steven Fleishman of Wolfe Research Please go ahead.","Steven Fleishman","Just a brief question on the Ohio plant. I know we had the FERC decision regarding the PPAs, but we also had a decision, not too long ago on AEP's ESP by the Supreme Court that kind of might arguably be comparable to the plans you filed, so do you have any thoughts in context of that decision?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I thoughts are quite frankly, we see that our filing, we think has been the correct path to take and we think it's within the PUCO\u2019s purview to grant because we think it's a very similar to what we currently have in the ESP. So for those reasons, we remain optimistic.","Steven Fleishman","And then just on the longer term drivers, you've given great visibility on the growth drivers and particularly new projects. Just to fill out the picture, are there any visible cliffs or roll offs over this period that we need to match against the growth projects or are those pretty much kind of done with at this point?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I would say that the only one we have is really Southland, that\u2019s where are repowering. That\u2019s more in sort of 2020 timeframe that we have the roll ups. And I'd say that that\u2019s basically -- and in DPL, we have the -- our application for 2017 would eliminate any such cliff at DPL. So, we have nothing else major out there.","Ahmed Pasha","Yes. Steven, this is Ahmed. Just on DPL, our PPA expired in \u201818 but we still operate the plant through 2020; and in 2021, our new plant comes on line -- Southland, sorry.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","This is Southland. So, that\u2019s the only when have we are PPA expires, so we are going to repower the plant.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Chin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Brian Chin","A question for you on the batteries\u2019 segment, which is one of the more unique aspects of the Company. You mentioned that you\u2019re seeing growth through two paths. Of the 394 megawatts in operation construction or late development, is there a way you can break out between what AES owns versus build by AES or is that all AES owned projects you\u2026","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Those are all AES owned projects. So, we don\u2019t have -- we are working very hard on these third-party sales. We have a lot of interest in projects we are working on, some with channel partners, some on our own. And we hope to be giving you news sometime within the next six months. This is in many cases -- we're quite frankly creating the market because we are talking with regulators to make sure that the regulations allow compensation for battery-based energy storage. So yes, that\u2019s 100% our projects.","Brian Chin","And then, I know because the market structures are still under development, each project is sort of one-off situation. But, in terms of modeling this growth area, can you give us sort of rules of thumb about how to think about any modeling data points, for example like dollars per KW or return levels, just anything that we can use to try and get a little bit more specific on that?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","First, it\u2019s the way we are looking at it. I mean -- and you are correct, I mean, in some cases, we are putting up relatively small projects, sort of 10 megawatts, 20 megawatts to open up a market. And a lot of the return we believe will come from third-party sales. Now, we also are seeing some markets that are more competitive, and you have basically very rapid build out energy-based storage. And so returns come down. We have others, but we are looking at sort of long-term contracts. So, I think that the way we would look at the returns is that we would expect to earn on average the same as we earned in our other projects. We are not subsidizing this business. What will be new for us, quite frankly is the third-party sales, because there we don\u2019t have to put in any equity; essentially, we are using our intellectual property rights and our experience and the brand name of Advancion. So, it's a -- we have it quite frankly incorporated, the third-party sales, because we really want to get a good feel for what they will be like. But, with our channel partners, we are really casting a wide net. And we will see I think over the next 6 to 12 months much clear how big that business could get.","Operator","And our next question comes from Lasan Johong of Auvila Research. Please go ahead.","Lasan Johong","Thank you. Okay. So, Andr\u00e9s, I want to ask Julien's question slightly different way. How long do you think AES to sustain this 12% to 16% growth rate beyond the \u201817, \u201818 expectations?","Tom O'Flynn","At this stage, it's a little bit -- we are not ready to provide, guide sort of four, five year guidance out. I mean obviously there is a lot factors there that would influence this; what are forward exchange rates going to be, what are commodity curves, energy prices. But, what I think we feel very confident saying is we are not going to sort of run out of growth projects in 2018. We already have significant projects that will come on line 2019, 2020. And we continue to work on ways to accelerate that rate of growth. And part of it is our use of partnerships and our sell-down of assets to continue to turn capital into higher growth, higher return projects.","Lasan Johong","Well, is it at least fair to say that AES has now come out of the restructuring mode that\u2019s gone on for about a decade and now we are back into the growth mode; is that at least a fair treatment?","Tom O'Flynn","I think in terms of cash flow and earnings, it's a fair statement. That\u2019s how we measure success, honestly; we not going to measure in terms of megawatts. And I think we are going to remain the very disciplined Company that we have been, certainly over the last five years. We are going to be very disciplined and make sure that again not fall into any sort of rapid growth for growth sake, I mean we really want to maximize. And I think one of the things we have shown is that we are willing to have less megawatts and less clients under operation, but have a better risk profile and a better growth profile. That\u2019s really where we want to go.","Lasan Johong","Okay. Switching to Panama, is it fair to say you are looking at the source of LNG for the plant in Gulf of Mexico?","Tom O'Flynn","Yes. We have a contract through 2023 for gas from Trinidad for the Dominican Republic. In terms of the source of gas for our share, the 25% that we will be using, we have a contract with one of the big suppliers. They can source it wherever they feel best. Probably some of it will come from the U.S. liquefaction facilities in the Gulf. And then when they are -- we feel at the tank and other people are utilizing it and they are taking the commodity risk, it's up to them where they will source it.","Lasan Johong","Okay. So, it's coming from [indiscernible] model and not directly from this plant?","Tom O'Flynn","That\u2019s correct, unlike the case in Trinidad that we\u2019ve seen, but it was very directed and it was coming from Trinidad at the point, or initially. Now they have optionality.","Lasan Johong","Okay. A quick question on Brazil; there are very interesting assets, upper river of Paranapanema where AES's long said that controls that because it provides tremendous benefits, both in terms of cost as well as upgrades and development opportunities. It\u2019s on for sale, any comments?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think that it\u2019s true that Paranapanema which is owned by Duke in Tiet\u00ea were once one company and was split in two. Having said that, what we\u2019re looking at our complete portfolio, in terms of our risk profile. We have right now a lot of Brazil hydro risk. So, this really isn\u2019t, we think in our sweet spot at this point in time. And we also understand that they are going to sell the whole package together, of all the other assets. It\u2019s a pretty big ticket and there are other assets that we\u2019re not interested in. So, what I would say is that really at this point, it\u2019s not something we are actively pursuing.","Lasan Johong","Last question on Brazil, Brazil\u2019s been long in recession\/mild depression for the last couple of years. Do you think the Olympics will help bring it back out of that mode and back to a more possible economic profile or do you think it\u2019s need a political change to get that.","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","I think that the Brazil is a much more diversified economy than perhaps it gets credit for. I mean as you look at the GDP of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, it looks more like Belgium than it does to some of the Northeastern states of Brazil, so to realize that point. Now, I think that Brazil got itself into the some funk, some policy issues, not just commodity price drops. So, the good thing is that they can work their way out of it. Our view is that they\u2019ll probably take a couple of years at least for Brazil to get out of it. I don\u2019t think that the Olympics will have any effect whatsoever. I think the key point.","Lasan Johong","Really?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","Yes, I really think that. The key point for Brazil is, determine the political process; who is going to be the President within six months and what policies he will pursue; so, having said that, Brazil has a lot of strong points in its economy. So, if they get their political act together and take some tough structural changes, I\u2019m sure, it will be back within five years, I feel very confident that Brazil will be -- can be a strong economy again.","Lasan Johong","I\u2019m sorry but I have to ask one last question, which is if that\u2019s the case, then Brazil sounds like it\u2019s on a very fine line between great candidate for divestiture versus great candidate for expansion. AES has available -- slide BNDES, yet still owns a large chunk of everything that AES has a footprint in except for Sul. And there\u2019s been a lot of talk about privatizing the BNDES\u2019 interests. Is that something that you want to pursue more aggressively, depending on the political situation or is this something that\u2019s laid for a long time?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","We can\u2019t speak for BNDES and what they decide to do with their assets. We did have the separation of our assets in Brazil to give us greater operating control in Tiet\u00ea and greater capital structuring flexibility in general. So, we\u2019ve done that. And I would say that, if you look at what we\u2019ve done Brazil, we\u2019ve certainly de-risked our self significantly, because we sold half of our holdings in Eletropaulo in 2006. We spun off the telco from Eletropaulo; sold that for $1 dollars. So we feel that we\u2019ll continue to manage Brazil sort of holistically and look at what are the fundamental exposures we have there.","Operator","And our last question today comes from Charles Fishman of Morningstar. Please go ahead. ","Charles Fishman","Andr\u00e9s, just to follow up that last question; you are probably most knowledgeable person about Brazil that I ever get a chance to ask a question to. In a quarter or two quarters ago, you talked about a turnaround in Brazil, maybe 2018. And now, in response to the last question, I heard you say like more like five years. Has something happened in the last three months that makes you a little more pessimistic?","Andr\u00e9s Gluski","No, let me clarify that. I do think the turnaround in two years is still I would say possible, may be sort of 50-50 chance. What I think within five-years, I feel very optimistic at some point, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s three years, two years, they will come back. I think depending on the political resolution of that the crisis they are facing now, I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised that you have a sort of, I don\u2019t know, call it euphoria but a pickup in sentiment in Brazil with the resolution. I mean we\u2019ve seen that when you have certain political developments, they actually appreciate in the market. So, what I think is important to realize is that the crisis in Brazil has a lot to do with certain policies and not just the drop in commodity prices. So that makes the comeback more within their capabilities of doing.","Ahmed Pasha","Okay. We thank everybody for joining us in today\u2019s call. As always, the IR team will be available to answer any questions you may have. Thank you and have a nice day.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."]}}
