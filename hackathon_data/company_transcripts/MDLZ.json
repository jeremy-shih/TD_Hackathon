Welcome to the Mondelez International First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last for about an hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay","Good morning. Thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO.","Earlier today we sent out our earnings release in today's slides which are available on our website, MondelezInternational.com.","As you know, during this call we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our form 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thank you, Dexter. Good morning. As you know, 2015 is a year of big change for us and we're off to a solid start. We've continued to make good progress in a challenging environment by focusing on what we can control. This includes executing our transformation agenda, prioritizing margin expansion, and strong constant currency earnings growth while delivering solid revenue growth.","Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.8% driven by pricing actions to recover currency driven input cost increases. We significantly expanded adjusted operating income margins, up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Importantly, adjusted gross margin contributed more than half of the increase while lower overheads contributed the rest. Adjusted EPS was $0.41 up nearly 26% on a constant currency basis, driven almost entirely by operating gains.","As we discussed at CAGNY, we're executing three transformation priorities that will further leverage our advantage portfolio and geographic footprint while setting us up to deliver top-tier financial performance as global demand improves. Let me give you a quick update on each of our transformation initiatives.","To further focus our portfolio on snacks, to reduce our supply chain and overhead costs, and to continue investing for growth. On the portfolio front, we expect our Jacobs Douwe Egberts coffee joint venture to close this year, likely in the third quarter. We're working to secure the necessary regulatory approvals from the European commission and are awaiting the results of the Phase II review.","We anticipate closing our acquisition of Kinh Do\u2019s Biscuit business in Vietnam around mid-year and are looking forward to leveraging the growth opportunities of this attractive business. With about $175 million in sales, Kinh Do is one of the largest snack companies in Vietnam with iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and moon cakes.","Going forward we intend to accelerate its growth by introducing our power brands into its distribution network which covers 130,000 outlets. We also welcomed Enjoy Life Foods into our family last quarter. While starting from a relatively small revenue base, the company provides us with an excellent platform for future growth. We're very excited about the opportunity to leverage its strong brands and market position in fast-growing, better for you allergen-free snacks.","Turning to our cost reduction programs, we're continuing to make good progress across our supply chain and in overheads. Net productivity in the quarter was very strong at more than 3.0% of cost of goods sold, building on the record rate of 2.8% we delivered last year. These productivity gains were instrumental in driving our 90 basis points improvement in adjusted gross margin.","We're complementing the supply chain savings by aggressively managing overheads, leveraging the zero-base budgeting process we began about 18 months ago. This includes reducing indirect expenses, as well as streamlining infrastructure and internal processes.","In fact, we've already begun to migrate some transactional processes to our new global shared service centers. As a result, we continue to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue.","Of course these savings not only enable us to expand margins, but they also provide the fuel for investing in growth. As we highlighted at CAGNY, this includes investing in new advantaged assets as part of our supply chain reinvention.","For example, our biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico opened on schedule in the fourth quarter. By the end of the first half, we'll have five new lines up and running to support growth, and repatriate volume is currently co-manufactured. As you'll recall, each of these new lines gives us 1000-point margin increase over existing assets.","We're also bringing on stream advantaged lines of the future at other facilities around the world. In emerging markets like India and China, as well as in Europe and the U.S.","Each of these state-of-the-art lines has operating costs that are about half as much as our current lines, and runs twice as fast while taking up only a fraction of the floor space. We've also continue to invest in working media to strengthen our brand equities, backstop our pricing, and support innovation. Total advertising and consumer spending was essentially flat on a constant currency basis as we maintained marketing support particularly on our power brands.","That said, as a percent of revenue A&C was down slightly as we continued to drive efficiencies in nonworking media, move more advertising to lower cost digital channels, and shifted the timing of certain marketing programs. For the remainder of the year, we expect A&C to rise modestly as we invest behind new product launches and marketing programs to drive revenue and improve share.","Let's take a more detailed look at our top line results for the quarter. As you can see on slide five, organic net revenue grew 3.8% with pricing contributing 6.5 percentage points. Consistent with our strategy we've raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed previously, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our people and in our key growth drivers, our brands, innovation platforms, sales and distribution capabilities, and supply chain.","It's important to note that in the first quarter a significant contributor to the increase in price was the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year. Of course, rising prices especially when the increases are significant typically have a short-term impact on consumer demand. In Q1, vol\/mix was down 2.7 percentage points due in part to elasticity. As we discussed in our earnings call last quarter, we're also experiencing the impact of some strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. These include discontinuing some low-margin customer specific product lines especially in Europe, exiting low-margin products associated with short-term brand licenses from Kraft Foods, and ongoing SKU simplification. In the quarter, these strategic decisions accounted for about 140 basis points of the decline in vol\/mix.","For the full-year, we expect these decisions to be about 100 basis point headwind to our organic growth, and as we've said before, this has been incorporated into our revenue guidance. Partially offsetting this headwind in Q1 is about a 50 basis points benefit from a shift of Easter-elated shipments into the first quarter. Our power brands, which represent about two-thirds of our revenue, grew nearly 6% led by OREO, chock, Club Social, and belVita biscuits, Lacta chocolate, Trident gum, Halls candy, Jacobs, Carte Noir, and Tassimo coffee.","Emerging markets were up nearly 11% with the BRIC countries up double digits. Developed markets were down 0.5%. Turning now to our results by region, as you can see on slide six, Latin America and EMEA fueled by higher pricing drove much of our overall growth. Latin America was up nearly 19% driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up nearly 10% including a meaningful contribution from vol\/mix and solid growth across all categories.","EMEA grew 11% primarily due to pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of those currencies. Despite this, vol\/mix was up in both countries and share performance was solid. Russia grew mid-teens with strong growth in our two largest categories. Chocolate was up high-teens behind Alpen Gold and coffee was up over 20%. Asia-Pacific grew modestly with solid gains in China and India. China was up high single-digits driven by strong performance of both OREO and Stride gum. We continue to be encouraged by our progress, this is the third consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth there. Our team is executing well, and we're selectively investing to continue and hopefully accelerate our momentum.","India was up mid-single digits as Cadbury Dairy Milk share topped 40% its highest ever. However, chocolate price increases tempered consumer demand. We expect category and revenue growth in India to improve as the year progresses, not only as we increase A&C investments but also as consumers adjust to the industry-wide price increases implanted last year.","North America revenue declined modestly largely due to a change in a large customer's in-store strategy the reduced merchandising and display opportunities. Although this led to a decline in the overall biscuits category and a modest decrease in our revenue, we grew our share driven by strength in crackers. To accelerate revenue and category growth for the remainder of the year we're stepping up marketing support behind our power brands and innovation platforms, as well as increasing investments behind in-store execution.","Finally Europe was down 0.6% in line with our expectations. Frankly, we expect Europe's first half to be soft as the macro environment continues to be challenging. In addition, the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that I mentioned earlier, tempered Europe's volumes by about 200 basis points which was only partially offset by 60 point benefit due to the Easter shift.","We've continued to experience some negative volume elasticity as a result of our decision to lead pricing higher input cost especially in chocolate. However, we expect this pressure to ease in the back half.","Turning now to our categories, for the quarter snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally up from the low three's as we exited last year. Of course, the Easter shift helped boost growth rate somewhat including beverages cheese in grocery our categories edged closer to 5% growth. Along with overall category growth modestly improving, our share performance began to stabilize with 48% of our snacks revenues gaining or holding share in the quarter. That's up from 40% in 2014.","In addition, compared to the softening trends we saw in the back half of last year, our share performance improved across almost all of our snacks categories. The biscuits category grew about 4% down from 5% last year, much of this slower growth came in North America and Europe. Our biscuits revenue grew in line with the category as we gained or held share in key markets fueled by our power brands which grew high single-digits.","For example, OREO was up mid-teens driven by innovation in China and distribution gains in Brazil and Europe. Top Club Social grew more than 30% with launches of new flavors and pack sizes in Brazil. BelVita was up high single digits with strong growth in the U.S. behind the continued success of the BelVita Bites and in the U.K. with the belVita Tartine and crunchy.","Turning to chocolate, the category grew 6.5%, aided by the Easter shift. Our sales only increased slightly more than 1.0% with only about 35% of our revenue gaining or holding share. The softness was due primarily to our European business which accounts for half of our global chocolate sales. We expected this knowing that a significant portion of the decline would be due to our decision to discontinue some low-margin product lines, and that we'd continue to experience some volume elasticity and share losses because we led pricing.","Although we expect continued share pressure in Q2, we're encouraged to see that most of our European competitors have now begun to raise prices. As a result we expect our shares to strengthen in the back half of the year. In the meantime, we're selectively stepping up our marketing and promotional activity to narrow price gaps and regain share.","In emerging markets, increase mid-single-digits and we gained or held share in our key markets. For example, in Brazil our largest","Chocolate business in emerging markets, sales grew high single-digits and we increased share by about a point.","In India, our second-largest emerging markets Chocolate business, although the category slowed, revenue was up mid single-digits and we held share. And in Russia and South Africa, revenue was up mid to high-teens, holding share as well.","Looking ahead, as price gaps narrow and we increased marketing support in the back half of the year, we expect global chocolate revenue growth in both developed and emerging markets to accelerate and our shares to rebound. Turning to gum and candy, the category grew about 1.5% while our revenue was up nearly 6%. For the first time in a while, I'm pleased to see strong gum growth. Like chocolate our gum results are a tale of two cities. Developed markets continued to be down mid-single digits with share losses in France, Japan, and the U.S. But in emerging markets, gum was up mid-teens led by strong revenue and share performance in Brazil and China.","To summarize we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth in a challenging environment and made good progress in stabilizing our shares. We're executing our transformation agenda well, including aggressively reducing cost to expand margins and to provide the fuel to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth.","With that, let me turn it over to Brian.","Brian Gladden","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins, and grow earnings per share.","Starting with slide eight, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points to 38%. Pricing, including the carryover benefit of actions taken in 2014, more than offset the increase in commodity and currency related cost inflation this allowed strong productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million to fall through. Adjusted OI margin was up 160 basis points to 13.8%.","Adjusted gross margin expansion accounted for more than half of the increase, the rest was driven by lower overheads as we continued to aggressively reduce expenses by leveraging our zero-base budgeting approach and other cost saving tools. Looking at margin performance by region, you can see that North America, Europe, and Latin America drove our adjusted OI expansion. North America was up 400 basis points, more than half of this improvement was driven by strong net productivity with the remainder largely due to lower overheads. Europe was up 180 basis points as strong net productivity positively impacted adjusted gross margins. Latin America increased 120 basis points predominantly driven by overhead leverage.","In contrast EMEA declined 240 basis points. The sudden and severe devaluation of Ukrainian and Russian currencies made it difficult to fully recover input cost inflation in the near-term without sacrificing volume declines or share losses. As we exit the quarter, we're in a much better position with margins in these markets. We expect margin will improve as the year progresses as we continue to implement additional price increases to cover higher costs.","In Asia-Pacific, margin was down 30 basis points, while we improved gross margin and lowered overheads, the phase out of the local tax incentive program offset underlying year-over-year operating margin improvement. Turning to EPS on slide ten, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.41 up nearly 26% on a constant currency basis.","The year-over-year improvement in our operating income accounted for $0.09 of this increase. Below the operating line, lower interest expense from our successful debt refinancing added $0.01 and lower outstanding shares add another $0.02. Also below the line our effective tax rate was higher, driven mostly by the geographic mix of where our earnings were generated. The higher tax rate hurt our EPS by $0.02 versus last year.","Even after accounting for the $0.08 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 5%. On the next page, you'll see that we returned $1.75 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter. We purchased $1.5 billion of stock that represented 41.7 million shares and an average price of just under $36 as we frontloaded most of our buyback activity given the relatively attractive share price and our liquidity.","Consistent with our outlook, we expect to buy back up to $2 billion of stock for the year. However, this doesn't include additional share repurchase activity related to the expected cash proceeds from a coffee deal in the second half. We also paid about $250 million in dividends. As we previously stated, we intend to pay a modest dividend with shareholder returns largely driven by EPS growth. Nonetheless, we're committed to maintaining a payout ratio of at least 30%. Today our payout ratio is about 35%.","Turning to slide 12, in the first quarter we took advantage of an opportunity to refinance some of our higher cost dollar debt into lower coupon, euro, Sterling, and Swiss franc denominated notes. The weighted average rate for the $2.5 billion of U.S. dollar notes we tendered was about 6.2%. We financed the tender by issuing the equivalent of about $3.5 billion of notes at very attractive rates securing a weighted average coupon of 1.9%. As a result we lowered the weighted average cost of our long-term debt by about 100 basis points to 3.6%. We also extended the average tenure of our long-term debt by nearly a year from about 7.5 years to 8.5 years. For 2015, this lowers our total interest expense by $75 million to $100 million depending upon how currency rates evolve for the year.","Now turning to our outlook for the year. Given our solid start, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our 2015 outlook. With that said, we still have much to do as we execute our transformation. So in the near term, we want to be prudent and we are substantially reaffirming our outlook for the year. We continue to expect organic revenue to grow at least 2% including a headwind of about 100 basis points from the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that we discussed earlier.","We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. And we expect free cash flow excluding items to be approximately $1.2 billion. While our overall guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS has not changed, the makeup of the below the line items will be somewhat different. Due to our debt refinancing our interest expense is likely to be around $750 million rather than the original guidance around $825 million.","In addition, due to earnings mix and consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, our effective tax rate is likely to be higher than we originally anticipated. Instead of an estimated tax rate in the high-teens, we currently expect a rate in the low-20s. Of course, currency continues to be a significant and increasing headwind this year given that 80% of our revenue is not tied to the U.S. dollar. Using April 27 spot rates, we anticipate the currency headwind would be about 12 percentage points for revenue versus our earlier estimate of 11 points. We also anticipate a $0.33 impact to adjusted EPS compared to our initial $0.30 estimate.","While the currency impact is significant, we believe our underlying performance and operations are solid. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong constant currency earnings growth and solid organic revenue growth this year. One last point, since we don't have the necessary regulatory approvals to know the precise closing date for the coffee JV, our 2015 outlook includes the full-year results for the Coffee business. Assuming a closing sometime in the third quarter, we'll likely update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee transaction when we report our second quarter results.","So to wrap up, we've had a solid start to the year by focusing on what we can control as we prioritize margin expansion and strong constant currency earnings growth, while delivering solid revenue growth. We're making good progress on our transformation agenda. Our initiatives to focus our portfolio on track including the coffee JV, we're executing well against our cost reduction programs, and we're continuing to invest in our power brands, our supply chain sales, and distribution capabilities to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long-term. As we anticipated our market share performance has begun to stabilize we expect it improve the second half as price gaps narrow and we continues to selectively increased marketing support and promotional programs.","All of these actions have as well positioned to achieve our 2015 outlook and our 15% to 16% margin target for 2016.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Two questions if I could. First, Irene, you mentioned most European competitors have now started to take pricing and follow some of your moves and that's a new development and clearly positive one. But you also mentioned I guess promotional spend, it will be needed to narrow price gaps. I'm trying to get a sense of whether the pricing that others have taken are not enough to get the gaps still where you want? Or if it's one player in particular that maybe hasn't yet moved, I'm trying to just connect those two dots.","Irene Rosenfeld","The way it works is first of all, we've now seen most of our competitors announce as I mentioned but till it plays through, it takes some time. And in fact, it's one of the reasons I said we would still expect to see share softness in the second quarter. It'll take probably till the back half. In selected markets we want to continue to make sure that we're protecting our market position. So we've been very disciplined in looking market by market and seeing where we stand, and on that basis we're making that decision. But I feel quite confident that we will see our chocolate shares rebound in the back half of the year.","Andrew Lazar","Brian, initially, I knew you expected margins to get sequentially better as the year progressed, they obviously expanded quite a bit more in the first quarter than even the full-year target would suggest. Where was the primary source of that upside in the quarter to margins? And do you expect the expansion therefore, to be less pronounced in future quarters on a year over year basis? And if so, why would that be?","Brian Gladden","Yes, Andrew. I think we did see for probably the first time in a while, pricing is in a good position to cover inflation that we've seen driven by commodities and currency, which allowed net productivity to really drop through. I think that's the big one. As I mentioned in my comments, I think we were a bit ahead in terms of executing in a couple areas. One is supply chain and some of the reinvention activities helped contribute to that productivity. I think some of that is timing and executing a bit earlier, which helps, and then on overheads. We slightly beat our targets for overhead reductions, and that's really as ZBB is playing out, and our visibility and transparency to spending, and moving the culture to more cost-conscious culture I think is paying dividends for us.","So those are the things I think that give us a little bit of tailwind in the quarter. And again as we talked about, I think the supply chain reinvention is clearly a second half impact that we still expect to see. We may be pulled a little bit of that into the first part of the year, which is great but there will be more to come in the second half.","Andrew Lazar","So nothing necessarily one-off that we should expect starts to take down the rate of margin improvement necessarily as we move through the year, even though you're only looking for 100 basis points on a full-year basis of margin improvement? Because you start off the year quite a bit stronger than that?","Brian Gladden","I would just say the first quarter, 13.8 in the first quarter is a pretty solid number, not a lot of one-off items that contributed to that number were hurt in the quarter. It's a pretty clean quarter.","Andrew Lazar","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer, with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Good morning. A couple questions. First on gross margins, do you foresee 2015 as being a year of sequentially improving gross margin trend as you get new production up and running like the one you talked about at CAGNY in Mexico? And perhaps as you get the pricing in place and past some of these initial transactions effects, you talked about, for instance, in Russia, any color on sequential gross margin trends would be helpful.","Brian Gladden","Yeah, David, I think it's more of a first half\/second half dynamic as we talked about the supply chain. I think there's clearly some markets where there continues to be volatility and some areas were going to have to continue to work pricing to offset mostly currency-driven pressures. So it's a dynamic environment. We clearly looked at the second half as being more advantaged given the supply chain dynamic and we feel good about the start. Without getting into quarter-by-quarter trend I think this is a bit of a first half\/second story for us.","Irene Rosenfeld","But I would say, David, I do think you can see the algorithm start to play through and that's why we feel quite pleased with the quarter. The facts are that we're covering our cost increases through pricing as best we can. That's starting to play through and that's allowing our productivity to drop and you should see that dynamic continue to play through for the balance of the year.","David Palmer","Just to follow up on your comment about reinvesting and ANC. I know you don't want to share too much with your competition, but where have you've seen the best ROI on spend? Where should we generally think about you spending that money? Thanks.","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, what I'll tell you is we will be spending it where we get the best ROI and where we have capacity so I wouldn't know. There's certainly a number of our power brands like Oreo and belVita \u2013 we've got strong capacity coming in the back half and you'll see us spend behind those businesses. In the near-term though, I would say in a number of our markets I'm particularly pleased with the performance in EMEA, where we had to price quite aggressively in response to the rapid devaluation, and those are some of the markets where we were able to continue to make our ANC investments which than helped to protect our share.","So I think as you see our aggregate share performance around the world, much of that was due to the fact that we continue to spend and in some cases increased our spending behind franchises. But net-net, we will be spending where we get the best return of where we have good capacity support.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Spillane of Bank of America.","Brian Spillane","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Brian Gladden","Hi, Brian.","Brian Spillane","Just one question just to understand a little bit about what's happened on the gross margin line this quarter, and I guess to try to bridge the balance of the year. If I did this analysis or calculation right, you got about $560 million benefit from pricing on gross margin and $175 million of net productivity gains, you did a $435 million currency headwind just translation, so is the gap there \u2013 assuming that your pricing covers your commodity costs \u2013 is the gap there in terms of the drag the transaction effect on gross margin?","Brian Gladden","The numbers we would talk but would include the transaction impact of currency not translation. That said, the transaction impact is the pressure we're seeing mostly in the COGS line. Commodities are still up year-over-year in the quarter although they've been slightly down in the short-term so that is also a headwind. And when you think about the pricing that Irene talked about offsetting; it's really offsetting that transaction impact on our commodity prices and labor costs and other elements of the P&L.","Brian Spillane","I guess what I was trying to get at was as we look at gross margins going forward and assuming that there is not any incremental pricing or maybe even a little bit of promotional activity just how does the currency \u2013 how should we think about the currencies will affect gross margin over the balance of the year? Is it potentially more of a drag because currencies are a little bit more averse? Or is it more neutralized going forward because you've taken some pricing in some of the markets where the currency has moved a lot?","Brian Gladden","I think that becomes a market-by-market conversation. It's obviously our intent to use pricing to keep our margins whole as we see currency move around. So as currency stabilized over the last couple of months here a bit, we've caught up. And I think that's one of the contributing factors in the quarter. I think we just have to watch it quarter-by-quarter. There's some markets where we're still having to price, given that currencies have moved recently or we're still playing catch-up given how we can price in those markets. So I can't really answer the question on a global basis, I think it's market-by-market and I think we're in a reasonable spot in terms of covering currency right now. The ones I highlighted: Ukraine and Russia are places where it's taking time to get that through given the magnitude and the suddenness of those currency moves.","Brian Spillane","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi. Good morning.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hey, Chris.","Chris Growe","I had a question for you if I could first on North America. It was a very strong margin performance in North America, obviously a little softer revenue growth. I just want to get a sense of how the new plant would be contributing to that. Is that a major contributor in the quarter? It's a little sooner than I expected, but certainly nice improvement in the quarter.","Irene Rosenfeld","No, actually it's not a contributor yet. As we keep talking about the fact that supply chain reinvention will have more of a back half impact, that Salinas is one of the prime examples of that. The team has done an excellent job of cost control and particularly overhead management, and that was the key contributor to the very strong margin performance.","As we're starting up the plant, we're expensing those startup costs with a lot of volume, without up a lot of leverage in this plant. It's actually a drag in the first half of the year and that's part of why we expect improvement in the second half.","Chris Growe","Okay. That's good color. Thank you. I have a general question on the emerging markets. You've had a much stronger performance this quarter than many of your competitors and your peers, even in light of macroeconomic challenges. I'm just curious, is it your categories that are performing well? Is it your own internal performance? Just any color you can give on the stronger performance there, given in light of the challenges in those markets.","Irene Rosenfeld","We're very pleased with the performance in our emerging markets particularly given the significant inflationary pressures. I think our team has executed well both in terms of jumping on the pricing opportunity, managing that through very smart price architecture, as well as managing the cost line quite actively so that we can continue to invest behind the franchises. There's no question though, as was we look at markets like Russia and Brazil for example, and you see the GDP trends, we're cautious about that. We've got our eyes very carefully focused on inventory levels, making sure sell-in and sell-out are perfectly balanced. But there's no question that our teams have done an excellent job in this first quarter in managing our business in the face of quite a number of challenges in those markets.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Good morning, everyone. Irene, you talked about a big retailer, I assume Wal-Mart offering fewer opportunities for displays and promotions, and I appreciate this retailer has talked about doing this across the board. But do you think and maybe, maybe not, the cookie and cracker categories were hit by disproportionate amounts? I'm curious if you see risk of further promo de-loading down the road or is this more of a one-time shift?","Irene Rosenfeld","I think it was a near-term shift, Ken. And I think as you look at the impact that some of those decisions had on categories it, had a pronounced impact on the category and I do think that the opportunity to revisit some of those decisions and particularly in our categories which are highly impulse driven. We're big traffic generator and we contribute to overall growth. I do think that our teams are working through what the appropriate merchandising strategy should be and that's an important part of our optimism about the back half.","Ken Goldman","Thank you for that. One more if I can. I want to ask you about the specific media reports. I know you can't address them directly but I'm curious if you can help us understand how integrated the Philadelphia brand is with the rest of your European grocery business. I'm curious on a hypothetical basis, how hard would be to disassociate that brand and that brand alone from everything you're doing over there?","Irene Rosenfeld","That's a very hypothetical question. I would say that as we are basically dealing with the transformation in the European region, we are setting up a standalone cheese and grocery unit because I believe that is the best way for us to focus uniquely on those assets as distinct from some of our other assets. So as coffee moves into the joint venture, we'll have a snacking unit and a cheese and grocery unit, and I think that's the best way to manage those businesses going forward.","Ken Goldman","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Rob Moskow","Thank you. I guess a couple of questions, Irene. Your results in China after the last three quarters have been quite strong, up high single-digit. A lot of your peers have experienced significant inventory de-loading because of retailer slowdowns. Can you tell us about why you're bucking the trend there? Is this an easy comp from a year ago? Or is there something particular happening to your market share over there? And then the second question is on copy, I think the last time we talked about the divestiture, it would be accretive but maybe dilutive for the first six months. Can you give us any update there? Thanks.","Irene Rosenfeld","I'm very pleased with the perform of our business in China. I think actually we're not bucking the trend we actually live that trend. If you recall about a year and a half ago we ran into challenges as we saw demands slowing down quite rapidly and our inventories were not keeping pace with that. So as we talked about it we implemented a number of management tools and measurement tools to ensure that we had a good handle on sell in and sell out and that serving is exceptionally well so I think in many respects we were ahead of that curve and we've now got back behind us.","I'm particularly pleased though with the resurgence of the biscuit business which is a critically-important business for us. Oreo had a very strong quarter and is a strong contributor to the overall business performance and gum just continues to be on fire and so net\/net I think our Chinese business we learned a lot in the early days as we observed what happens when consumption slows down. I think we've got a much better balance between sell in and sell out the team is executing well and I'm extremely pleased with their performance. So we're cautiously optimistic but the continued performance of the biscuit category is important to us.","On coffee, Rob, we don't really have an update what we had said was we expected in 2016 that it will be accretive, we have no reason to believe that's not true at this point and the business has performed well. They had a very good first quarter for us and we'll wait to see really we get the approval from the European commission and then that will trigger our ability to get in and really do more detail planning with our partners.","Rob Moskow","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman","I guess first, just a specific question, Brian. You kind of mentioned in the Asia-Pacific that a tax incentive helped gross margin, or the phase out of the tax incentive, why is a tax incentive an operating factor?","Brian Gladden","It was a hurt in the quarter. We had historically an attack structure in place in China that allowed us, it basically showed up in our operating results and reduced our costs. That has been phased out in a decision by the government. We began to face into that at the end of last year and it had a relatively significant impact in the quarter on AP's results. I would say, as I said, they did have strong gross margin improvements they also reduced overheads, if you take that out, they had margins up in the quarter.","Eric Katzman","Okay. Just in terms of \u2013 I realize obviously currency is a massive headwind to earnings, but I think last quarter, maybe you had kind of said that in dollar terms, earnings per share for the year would be at least $1.70 and that included $0.30 of at least FX headwind but it also included the coffee still being in the base, but you're also suggesting that between \u2013 interest expense will be a benefit by a couple of pennies, currency is worse, your tax rate is growing now as a slight negative. So can you give us a sense as to what you're thinking on a dollar earnings basis for the year? Is it basically unchanged also with all those things moving around?","Brian Gladden","In essence we're not really \u2013 we haven't updated the outlook for EPS, what we did highlight is the fact that interest expense will be down a bit, tax will be up a bit. I think those things would basically offset the change relative to currency is about a $0.03 difference from when we last updated you, so $0.30 going to $0.33.","Eric Katzman","Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Brian Gladden","Thanks, Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow","Good morning, everyone.","Irene Rosenfeld","Good morning.","Ken Zaslow","North America as you said seems to be expanding margins before the Salinas plant and I didn't really understand for sure but it seems like maybe that is going \u2013 that margin expansion is actually going ahead of schedule. Does that mean that you think that of the areas out there that North America has the greatest opportunity to expand margins on top of where we're going from today? Is that a fair point?","Brian Gladden","I'm not sure I'd say that. I think we've highlighted the opportunity related to Salinas and how much margin impact we would have. I mean as we've talked about and Daniel talked about at CAGNY, as we implement lines of the future, those opportunities exist broadly across the other regions as well. They will be likely one of the first to feel the benefit of the new supply chain capabilities and the lower cost. The team has done a nice job managing through productivity, they've done a nice job managing through overheads and I would say they're a bit ahead in the process.","Irene Rosenfeld","And also, Ken, that's one of the areas that we have of greatest return on our marketing investments and we're going to continue as our capacity comes on stream, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, as our capacity comes on stream that's an area where we're going to continue to invest as we see the margin progression.","Ken Zaslow","Great. And on that point and I just want to \u2013 you also said the back of the year you're expecting to increase your advertising spend behind new product innovation. Can you talk about, assuming you're not going to tell us what new product innovation, but can you talk about region and categories where you'd see the acceleration of new product innovation?","Irene Rosenfeld","You're going to see it around the world. I mean one of our strong suits has been the strong performance of our innovations and I think as we continue to move to a region category model, we are finding that we're able to expand our proven platforms even faster. So as you think about different innovations within our categories, Oreo thins in China is performing exceptionally well and you'll start to see that make its way around the world. I talked about the belVita line extensions that are doing well and that continues to be an area of opportunity. Within chocolate, we've got continued terrific response, continued terrific response in Bubbly and Marvellous Creations and you'll see us expanding those.","And gum and candy we've got a series of innovations. Trident Unwrapped here in the U.S. is the first slab gum that you can get in the bottle and it's off to a good start and so that you'll see that when we'll play an important role as well as in China for example where we're actually going to launch a second line. We've got our Stride brand that has done exceptionally well. We're now going to be launching Trident in China. So in many cases what we're talking about are the expansion of proven platforms around the world.","Ken Zaslow","Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning. Just two detailed questions and then a bigger picture question for you, Irene. Brian, on the share repurchase I think your slide said you did $1.75 billion of share repo in the quarter. I think your target for the year was between $1 billion and $2 billion. So would this mean that you've done the share repurchase that you wanted to do for the full year or is there any more to go?","Brian Gladden","Yeah, we've done 1.5 in the quarter and what we said was we do up for two so I would suspect it will do up to two. That's what we said.","David Driscoll","Okay. So there's a little bit more to go. Fine. Now marketing, Irene I think you said on the quarter it was flat on a constant currency basis. Does that mean that with FX it was down about 14%?","Irene Rosenfeld","Directionally I don't know quite how the currencies flow through the medium money but it would be, you know, and obviously particularly in the emerging markets it would be down a little bit. I think the important point is that particularly given the aggressive pricing, we have really focused on making sure that we've got adequate marketing support behind our brands, and particularly our power brands, and that's been a key driver of their strong performance. The aggregate A&C that I reference that was down slightly, again, that was primarily nonworking spending that we will continue to look for efficiency opportunities. So A&C is a key driver of the strong performance of our power brands which are up about 6 % in the quarter and they will continue to be the focus of our investment as we look out to the balance of the year.","David Driscoll","And then, Irene, just \u2013 Kraft tie-ins uncovered a fairly massive cost savings in their merger announcement. You do have a rather unique position in analyzing kind of what they've done. The question here is a Mondelez question, though. In thinking about Mondelez, do you see further opportunities for larger cost savings and higher EBIT margins after you hit the 15% to 16% target?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yeah, Dave, clearly the Heinz model is something that the entire industry is watching. And we are watching very closely just to see how that plays out. At the moment, we're quite comfortable with our approach. I think we've got a good balance between top line and bottom line.","I think the margin performance that we're delivering both in terms of gross margin as well as operating margin is strong and where we'd hoped it was going to be. And so I'm quite confident that the programs as we have laid them out today leave us well-positioned not only to deliver our 2015 targets but also to deliver the targets that we've laid out into the future. So we'll keep watching and learning, but I'm quite confident with the approach and the path that we're on.","David Driscoll","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning, folks.","Brian Gladden","Good morning, Jason.","Jason English","Irene, I want to pick up on a comment you just made in response to the last question, a good balance of top line and bottom line growth. Looking at results over the last year or so, it really felt like the balance was not really balanced at all but shifted heavily towards priming the pumps for margin expansion, with the top line faltering as a result of whether it be executional issues, conscious decisions to exit things, et cetera. Do you think that's a fair characterization, first? And then secondly, do you truly believe that we're getting back into a better balanced algorithm on a go forward? And if so, what's the enabler that's allowing you to shift more focus back to driving sales in conjunction with margin?","Irene Rosenfeld","Jason, I think it's a fair characterization. I think we were very clear to say first things first. We needed to get our gross margins on our key franchises where we wanted them to be. And then we were going to be in a position to start to spend back, and that's exactly what we're doing. And so certainly, as we've said, there'll be more opportunity to spend back in the back half as more things kick in on the cost side. But even now, we're already starting to make some adjustments to our spending and making sure we're focusing it on the target areas that we think we can get the best return and where we think we need to protect the franchises. So I think you're seeing the algorithm play through in a more balanced \u2013 you will see the algorithm play through in a more balanced way this year than perhaps you would have seen last year, but we were just getting ourselves essentially staged to be able to deliver the cost profiles that we need so we have the fuel to invest in our franchises.","Jason English","Thank you. That's helpful. One more, then I'll pass it on. As you were going through your prepared remarks, you listed a lot of things that should get better on a go forward. You're strategic decisions to exit business, the headwind is more pronounced, it should get easier. You're looking for better category growth in a number of markets as consumers adjust to price points. You're looking for better market share improvement on a go forward. Lots of things you talked about in terms of anticipation of getting better. I guess my question is do you need it all to get better to deliver your numbers? Or are is there enough flexibility in the algorithm of go forward to absorb a few of those things maybe not going the right way and still hit your numbers?","Irene Rosenfeld","I think were well-positioned if you do the math. Given our strong start to the year, we feel quite comfortable with the guidance that we've laid out. It's a solid start. We're executing well, and there are some things that we believe will go our way in the back half. But we continue to believe that the guidance that we're giving you is quite prudent, and we feel quite confident in the full-year projections.","Jason English","Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Irene Rosenfeld","Good morning, Alexia.","Brian Gladden","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","So just a quick question on the Enjoy Life acquisition. If I think back to when you were still with combined with Kraft, there were a number of those sort of health and wellness oriented brands, like Back to Nature that never really seemed to find their place properly in the portfolio. They kind of got lost. As you think about buying Enjoy Life and try to figure how to scale that, what's different this time around? And do you have an appetite for doing more of those kinds of deals over time? Thank you very much and I'll pass it on.","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, Alexia, without a doubt, better-for-you snacking is on trend. It's resonating well with our consumers around the world, and therefore, it will continue to be an important focus area for us. We've learned a lot from the Back to Nature experience, and in fact, we still have an ownership of that business. As we bring Enjoy Life into the portfolio we've announced that we're going to keep the management separate and I think that's an important enabler to make sure that we get the lessons that we need, we learn the lessons but at the same time we're allowing the team that has been so successful to continue to drive the business. So I think you should expect to continue to see us building on our Better For You snacks both organically and through M&A and enjoy life becomes an important cornerstone of that effort.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge.","Rob Dickerson","Thank you very much. Just a bit of a follow-up question that Jason had, it seems like at the end of last year I think your categories were growing I believe it was 3.6% and you had said 2015 might be a little bit lower around 3% than in Q1 you're putting up 4.8% in global category growth. I think you'd said even expect to potentially see the chocolate accelerate in the back half of the year. So if you expect \u2013 if we're seeing much faster growth that you saw in 2014 in Q1 in your categories and you're also expecting some of those categories to accelerate and you expect to gain share as price gaps narrow, why wait or why not really increase your top line organic sales growth guidance especially if comps aren't becoming more difficult? Thank you.","Irene Rosenfeld","Rob the first point is over the long-term there is no question we expect to grow at or above category rates. As we said though in 2015, we are very clearly prioritizing margin expansion over revenue growth. It reflects the challenging environment and we've got a very significant transformation we want to make sure that in all cases that our managers are able to make the appropriate trade-offs. So we feel good about the revenue growth in the first quarter, we're very pleased to see that the snacks business in particular is up around 4.5% which is a trend change from the end of last year but I think you also need to get underneath the covers a little bit on that number.","A big driver of that 4.5% improvement was the 6.5% growth in chocolate which is largely price driven as we've said, also benefited somewhat from the Easter shift. So the good news is we are starting to see pricing coming through and that's critical to our overall algorithm as we're said. Our mix is still soft and we're taking some actions in the coming months and quarters to make sure that we start to see our shares rebound. So net, we're cautiously optimistic about the improved category growth, but we'd like to see more than the first quarter to feel confident about that.","Rob Dickerson","Okay. Great. Fair enough. Just a quick technical question and hopefully I'm explaining this the right way. But it looks like in the first quarter you bought back the 1.5 billion in shares part of that you could argue was funded by the proceeds that you got from the currency hedges off the coffee divestiture. Without that you might be apt to raise more debt to buy back the stock or whatever and not buyback. So I'm just curious, when you announced the coffee JV, the euro was close to 140.","Now current market it's around 111 so it seemed like and I think you put this within the footnotes of the release, it seems like the cash proceeds now you would receive on a dollar basis our less, which could potentially mean that you'd be able to buy back less stock with those proceeds. But at the same time you're buying back more stock in Q1 off of the benefit of this currency hedge. So it would seem like \u2013 I guess the question is, is it fair to say that maybe some of that accretion just off of the shift in the euro has already occurred? Thank you.","Brian Gladden","I mean, the simple way to think about it is, we locked in the rate last spring, and I think we locked it in, in the range of 1.37 euro which basically protected our dollar proceeds from the transaction. So what we did was really take that favorability from a timing standpoint and just basically cash some of that in during the course of the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So we locked in our proceeds, our proceeds will not go down given what's happening currency that was the intent of the hedge all along was to lock that in and it locks it in \u2013 the value is in the range of $5.5 billion.","Rob Dickerson","Yeah, you just hopefully get more of a benefit upfront off of just weighted average shares outstanding. Okay.","Brian Gladden","Just liquidity in the short-term, yeah.","Rob Dickerson","Fair enough. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","We've reached the allotted time for questions and answers today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondel\u0113z management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay","Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Dave Brearton, our CFO, and Brian Gladden our incoming CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release in today\u2019s slides, which are available on our Web site Mondel\u0113zinternational.com.","As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks, Dexter, and good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a strong third quarter in an environment that continues to be challenging we delivered top tier earnings growth and margin expansion as well as solid revenue growth. Specifically organic revenue was up 2.7%, adjusted operating income margin increased 140 basis points to 13.6%, and adjusted EPS was $0.50 up 33% on a constant currency basis due largely by strong operating gains. This is the third consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve expanded margins by at least 100 basis points and posted doubled digit EPS growth","We delivered this by successfully executing our productivity and supply chain initiatives and through early wins from our zero based budgeting program. The primary revenue driver in Q3 was pricing to offset higher input cost which contributed 5.8 percentage points to our growth. Our pricing actions were broad based spanning all categories and regions, though they were most significant in chocolate and coffee given the steep rise in both cocoa and green coffee cost. As expected, increased pricing and the wider price graphs that resulted pressured overall volume mix, which was down 3.1 percentage points. Volume mix was also affected by the pricing related customer disputes in France that we mentioned last quarter.","We priced to fully recover commodity and currency see impacts and we took action earlier than our competition. As we discussed in our last earnings call, in the short term, this will temper revenue growth until gaps narrow and customers and consumers adapt to the higher prices. Fortunately, towards the end of the quarter, conditions started to improve. Most of the customer disputes have now been resolved and price gaps have began to narrow, especially in emerging markets. Overall, organic revenue grew 2.7%, driven by an increase of 9% in emerging markets. Some of that growth was due to China, which grew high single digits behind stepped up innovation and marketing as we lapped last year's inventory destock. Another factor was the impact of hyperinflationary markets. And we are very pleased that Brazil, Russia and India each posted double digit increases including solid contributions from vol mix and innovation. For instance, in Brazil, Oreo and belVita continued to perform well. In Russia, our Marvellous Creations platform captured a 1% share of the chocolate tablet market within its first month, while new Dirol flavors and innovative packaging drove share gains in gum.","And in India, new pack sizes and formats for Cadbury Dairy Milk fuels double digit growth and strong share gains. In developed markets, organic revenue declined 1.3% as we continue to deal with an increasingly tough operating environment. That included temporary dislocations associated with pricing related customer disputes especially in Europe and increased promotions by competitors particularly in North America. In both cases, we chose to stand our ground to maintain the investments necessary to support our brands over the long-term. ","Let's look more closely at our Q3 revenue by region. In Europe, which accounts for about 40% of our business, organic revenue was down 2.4%. The commercial dispute accounted for more than a 100 basis points of the decline. In Q4, we expect less of a headwind from these disputes. As I mentioned earlier over the past month we've reached agreements with most of our customers though we did lose some distribution with a few of them. In addition and as expected, the elasticity impact of higher pricing significantly tempered our volumes. This was especially true in coffee where for the first time in two years, we increased prices. As expected consumers and customers reduced pantry and trade stocks after the price increase which affected volumes. So, coffee revenue was a 50 basis point headwind in Europe. ","In North America. organic revenue was essentially flat for the quarter. U.S biscuits up-low single digits, a big slower than last quarter but in line with the category as we cycled strong prior year growth. This was offset by a decline in confections. In EMEA, organic revenue grew 5.6%. Russia led the way with mid-teens growth including double digit gains in coffee, chocolate and biscuits. I recently visited our team in Russia and in the phase of significant macro-economic headwinds, they are doing an exceptional job of defying gravity and growing well in excess of GDP. Russia's performance is more than offset weakness in other markets in the region that are experiencing political and economic instability.","Latin America grew 18.5%, the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Brazil delivered another strong quarter up mid-teens with positive vol mix despite significant pricing. Growth in Brazil was broad based. Biscuits, chocolate, powder beverages and gum and candy, all posted strong gains. The inflationary economies of Argentina and Venezuela continued to drive the sharp rise in pricing for the region overall. And finally, Asia Pacific returned to growth this quarter with organic revenue up 1.3%. China grew nearly 10% as we cycled last year's inventory destocking and began to see the impact of our turnaround plan. Although the macro environment remains soft, we are seeing early signs of success with our reinvigorated marketing and innovation programs.","For example we recently introduced innovations such as Oreo Thins and Mini Oreos as well as new packaging formats to broaden usage occasions. We also adapted some proven marketing programs from our global playbook such as the Oreo WONDERFILLED campaign. In response, biscuit category growth in China has kicked up recently and our share trends have also improved. Beyond, China India delivered another quarter of double digit growth behind strong gains in chocolate and Australia and New Zealand grow low single digits as the retail environment stabilized. ","Now let's have a look at category growth. Overall global category growth remain below long-term trends. Year-to-date growth for our snacks categories was around 4% and stood at about 3.5% for all of our categories including beverages, cheese and grocery. Our organic revenue grew 2.2% over that same period, in line with our annual guidance but a little more than a point below category growth. This difference is primarily due to three things, the elasticity impact of significant chocolate pricing, the impact of the customer disputes in France across a number of our categories and the cycling of the investments we made in China biscuits last year.","In Q4, we expect the impact of chocolate pricing and the residual effect of the French trade dispute to continue. These factors are built into our full year revenue guidance. Turning to market share, overall year-to-date performance remained solid with 54% of our revenues gaining or holding share. Given that we increased pricing in all of our categories, shares softened a bit in Q3 to about 49% as we had expected. As we exit the year, we expect our shares to stabilize as consumers adjust to new price points and gaps begin to narrow. ","So to summarize, we delivered solid top line growth in a challenging consumer and customer environment. In the phase of this temporary period, a weaker category growth, we've made a conscious decision to increase prices to recover higher input cost even if we have to accept some near term share loss. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in high return route to market and capacity expansion projects, while driving productivity and cost reduction to increase earnings, expand margins and fuel further growth. Near term, leveraging this approach through 2015, we'll deliver value to our shareholders regardless of the macro environment. And over the long term, this will enable us to deliver sustainable top tier performance on both the top and bottom lines. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.","Dave Brearton","","Thanks Irene. Good morning. Over the next few slides, I'll walk you through our bottom line results and our updated outlook. Adjusted gross profit dollars were up 3.1% and adjusted gross profit margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to deliver productivity at record levels. Year-to-date we generated net productivity of more than 2.5%. Costs increased high single digits in the quarter due primarily to coffee, cocoa and currency. Forex actually drove about half of that increase primarily in emerging markets. We priced to recover these costs on a dollar basis, with pricing contributing nearly 6% points in the quarter. Of course with this level of pricing, the percentage margin was negatively affected by what we call the denominator effect. But our strong productivity programs and a modest mark-to-market benefit allowed us to expand gross margins in the quarter. ","Now let's take a closer look at operating income. As Irene mentioned earlier, we've now posted our third consecutive quarter of significant adjusted OI margin expansion since we outlined our supply chain and cost reduction initiatives. Specifically, adjusted OI dollars increased 16.5% in the third quarter and we're up 14.7% year-to-date on a constant currency basis. Adjusted OI margin was 13.6% up a 140 basis points in Q3. Year-to-date, adjusted OI margin has increased to 130 basis points to 12.8%. Our margin expansion was mainly driven by lower overheads, as we're beginning to see the benefits of our ZBB program playing through the P&L. Changes in our spending policies are already making a difference in overheads, and we expect these savings to continue to build as we enter 2015. ","In addition we're continuing to drive AMC efficiencies by reducing non working cost like advertising production. And the consolidation of our agency and media provider especially in emerging markets like EMEA and Asia-Pacific is providing real savings to our bottom line. Importantly our working media investment and the level of consumer engagement remains in line with prior year, as we continue to invest in our brands at a healthy rate. And within our working media, we're continuing to shift more of our global media spending to digital, which delivers about twice the ROI of traditional media. ","Taking a closer look at margins, it's encouraging to see the breadth of our margin expansion. Through September, all five of our regions delivered higher margins versus the prior year. North America and Europe each delivered approximately 200 basis points of margin improvement. Not surprisingly these two regions are delivering the lion share of our margin expansion, as they're the primary focus of our supply chain work and overhead cost programs. But Latin America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific also delivered higher margins for the first nine months. ","Turning to EPS, our margin improvement is also driving strong EPS growth. Through the first nine months, our adjusted EPS was $1.29 up 22% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains are the key driver accounting for 19 of the $0.25 of improvement on a constant currency basis year-to-date. Lower interest expense and the impact of share buybacks provided another $0.12 of upside more than offsetting a $0.06 headwind as we had last year\u2019s exceptionally low tax rate.","Let me now quickly update you on where we stand on capital allocation and cash flow. With regard to free cash flow, we remain on track to deliver our two year target of $3.7 billion. Our growth and earnings coupled with our continued focus on improving working capital are the primary drivers. Through September, our cash conversion cycle improved approximately 21 days consistent with year-to-date performance. We have also returned over $1.9 billion for our shareholders including repurchasing $1.2 billion of stock or about 34 million shares. Based on this, we now expect our total share repurchases for 2014 to be between $1.2 billion and $2 billion. Additionally, we paid at a little over $700 million in dividends.","Turning to our outlook, although Q3 revenue came in better than expected we\u2019re maintaining our top line outlook. Global economic conditions and the category growth remain challenging and while we reach agreements to resolve most of our customer disputes, we remain cautious about residual impact on Q4; however, we are raising our guidance on adjusted operating income and margin based on our strong performance through the first nine months. Adjusted operating income on a constant currency is now expected to grow approximately 10%, up from high single digits previously, and adjusted OI margin is now projected at approximately 13% versus the high 12s we guided to early this year.","Our confidence in delivering the higher OI margin target is routed in our strong margin expansion year-to-date as well as our visibility to the pipeline of cost and productivity savings for the balance of the year. We are also increasing our adjusted EPS range by $0.09 to $1.82 to $1.87 on a constant currency basis, up from the previous range of $1.73 to $1.78. This includes about $0.06 from the lower than expected effective tax rate reflecting a number of favorable discrete tax events. For the year, we estimated effective tax rate in the high teens versus our prior expectations of around 20%.","Our strong operating performance added $0.01 to $0.02. The remaining $0.01 to $0.02 comes from favorable interest expense. In our revised guidance, we\u2019ve included a similar benefit in the fourth quarter. At this point, I want to pause for a moment to thank Irene, the Board and the leadership team and specially all of the people on my finance team based around the world for the opportunity to serve as CFO and the for the tremendous support over the years. As you know, this is my last earnings call as CFO on December 1st, I\u2019ll assume new role that focuses primary on the establishment and launch of our coffee joint venture with D.E Master Blenders.","I would also like to this opportunity to welcome Brian Gladden as our incoming CFO who joining us at an exciting time as we accelerate our growth and cost agendas. Brian is a seasoned financial leader who knows how to create shareholder value. His background together with extensive experience operating in emerging market and developing talent will greatly benefit our global organization and our shareholders.","With that, let me hand it over to Brian for a few words.","Brian Gladden","Thanks, Dave, it\u2019s really great to be here. I am very excited to join the team and I look forward to helping our company reach its potential. We have an aggressive transformation agenda underway and I am thrilled to help lead that effort going forward. Dave and I have already been working together very closely to ensure smooth transition and I look forward to meeting many of you in the near future.","With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a quick update on our strategic initiatives.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks, Brian. Let me add my welcome to you and also to extend my heartfelt thanks to Dave who has been a terrific partner over the years, but of course Dave is not off the hook which is a good segway to a review of our strategic initiatives which remain firmly on track. First our planned coffee joint venture is moving ahead and we continue to expect the deals to close in 2015. We are making progress in securing regulatory approvals as well as engaging with our work councils. As you can imagine, there is still a lot to do at this stage of the business for continued success so I am very pleased that Dave will be able to focus on this project at this critical juncture.","Second, we continue to advance our goal to deliver best-in-class cost in both our supply chain and in overhead. On the supply chain reinvention front in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll open our newest Greenfield biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico, right on schedule. As we\u2019ve said in the past, this plant will provide 1000 basis points of margin improvement for products made there, compared to our existing network and we recently announced a $90 million investment in a new biscuit plant in Bahrain to support regional growth.","We are in the midst of our first annual budget process leveraging our new ZBB toolkit and revised cost policies. I can tell you that ZBB is having desired impact on our culture. We\u2019re pushing our teams to make the tradeoffs to budget at a very granular level and challenge old ways of thinking. This sets the stage for a best-in-class cost structure and further margin improvement over the next few years. Finally as you know this past May we announced the adoption of a category led model in all of our regions starting January 1st, 2015. This operating model will deliver improvement in both our top and bottom lines by accelerating launches of proven innovations around the world by clarifying and streamlining decision making, by reducing cost through simplification, standardization and scale and by building world class capabilities and operating discipline. This is a significant change in how we run the business, especially in our emerging markets. Right now we are staging the new organization for launch. We've announced all the leaders of the region category structure and their staffs. And in the coming weeks, we will be working to ensure that the new organization is in place to deliver our 2015 plan. As you can imagine all of this transformation work is quite an undertaking. But big change is something we do very well here. I am quite confident in our ability to successfully implement these initiatives to get this company fit to win regardless of the macro-environment and to deliver sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. With that, let me open it up now for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. ","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","","Two questions from me. First on last quarter's call, it sort of seemed like organic sales growth in the third quarter would be probably more similar to 2Q given all the issues that you had discussed on the call. It came in better and you did hold your, full year organic sales target range kind of steady. I am just trying to get a sense of do this suggest you potentially feel better about the upper end of that 2% to 2.55% range or not. And the reason I ask is you have an easier comp in 4Q. And if you would hit the lower end of a range that would imply a sort of a sequential deceleration in organic sales in the fourth quarter. I am just trying to get a sense if there be any reasons we should expect that?","Dave Brearton","","Andrew, its Dave. I think year to date our organic growth is 2.2%. So it's about middle of that range year-to-date. As we look at quarter four, I think a lot of the stuff we talked about on this call for quarter three; we would expect to continue on. Global category growth is probably not going to change especially in Europe where other consumers are under a bit more pressure. Competition has price, particularly on chocolate in our emerging markets, but in Europe they haven't yet price and it doesn\u2019t look like they will through quarter four. And while as Irene said, we resolved the French disputes in Europe and the process we lost a little bit of distribution in a few customers and some of those disputes were only resolved in October. So you are going to see all of those factors carry forward into Q4. So we just felt it was prudent to keep our full year guidance of the 2% to 2.5% range.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","","Thanks for that. And then secondly, I certainly understand the impact around the math of higher pricing on the gross margin percentage and such. But I guess, I am just trying to get a sense of such a big part of the story going forward is really as organic sales growth accelerates, it should happen on in even more compelling cost structure and then the earnings leverage that comes from that. And I guess I would have thought with all the productivity that you are generating. We would have still seen more underlying gross margin improvement. So trying to get a sense if there is anything else at work there that was a headwind or was it really as you see it purely the math of the pricing?","Dave Brearton","Yes. The simple answer is the math of the pricing. Our commodity costs and Forex impacts in the quarter were up in the high single digit, so a very big number. We price to fully recover that in dollar terms and that's why you saw the 6% pricing come through and we were able to get that in the market while maintaining good performance on our shares. But the simple math is if we are maintaining $1 margin on a 6% price increase is that you end up with this denominator effect and it was quite material in the quarter. Our net productivity as you pointed out was at record levels. We've never had better than net productivity of 2.5%. And that did drop through, that provide a gross margin dollar growth and it allowed us to fully offset that denominator impact and drive a little bit of gross margin gain. So I understand the question but we are actually quite happy that we grew gross margins in the phase of high single digit commodity and Forex impacts in the quarter. As we go forward, I don't think we will see those kind of costs and price increases every year. I think that equation of pricing recovered dollars and using productivity to cover the percentage impact and still drive give us fuel to drive growth will result in gross margins increasing over time and you are right, it's a key part of why we believe we can get to the 15% to 16% OI margins by 2016.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","","Hey good morning everybody. Dave best of luck going forward. Brian I don't know if you are available for questions but I am curious how you would describe your style in general, what do you think your strengths are as a CFO, what do you think you bring to the company your new role? And then also when you left Dell you quoted as saying that you do have a desire to run a company. So I am curious, how that corresponds with your new role, it\u2019s a huge responsibility but it\u2019s not running the shebang so to speak. So I am just trying to understand your personal goals and how that corresponds with that quote a little better.","Dave Brearton","","Hey, Ken thanks. I would start by saying obviously great to be here, just getting started enjoying the transition and the time with Dave to really learn the business. For me this is a terrific opportunity to be part of building something great here and I would just say I'm very excited, I think I expect I'll have the chance to spend some time with you guys over the next quarter or two and at that point I'll be able to share some early thoughts on sort of how I think about the business and how you'll see my role playing out, but I'm extremely excited to be the CFO and partner with Irene here to drive the company going forward.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","","So you're you good in answering questions politically, I like that. And then Irene, part of the margin and maybe this is a better question for Dave but part of the margin growth story depends on plants around the world closing and opening in line with your schedule, can you update us on progress here, have been any delays or is everything on pace with kind of what you anticipated?","Irene Rosenfeld","No actually we're feeling quite good about the pace, obviously the most important next big investment was in Salinas and as I mentioned we're very pleased with the progress and we're about to have that plant up and running. As we look around the rest of the world everything is pretty much on schedule, the one place that we're continuing to be keep a watch on is that we have a plant in Siberia that's about to come on stream in the next year and a half and we'll continue to keep our eyes on that as we watch the political situation there but net-net we're very much on track with all of the supply chain reinvention initiatives that we laid out, and as you know that's going to be a big part of our gross margin improvement going forward.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","","Good morning everybody, Dave best of luck.","Dave Brearton","","Hi Eric.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay, couple of questions. How much was total advertising and promotion down in the quarter?","Dave Brearton","","I think it was down a 100% due to the productivity efforts we mentioned our working media was actually dead flat versus year ago so we continue to spend the same amount of time there. In terms of the productivity impacts, I don't think, I'm not sure I want to give you that number right now, but I can tell you it is below the 9% rate that we recorded in the past but it's all been based on the agency consolidation and the ZBB approach we took to the non working media. So we're pretty confident that we kept the investment at the level it needs to be.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","It looked like if your product I'm kind of wondering how much came out of Europe, because your product is not on the shelf or a small percentage of what it was, why would you advertise there if you don't have product on shelf, I mean was that a material factor in the quarter?","Dave Brearton","","No, not really. That was really a French issue so one country in Europe, one of the most important things as you go through these pricing periods is that you continue to support the brands because you got to make sure you've got the consumer poll to help drive that pricing through both the customers and get the consumers over the price shot. So we very much focused on maintaining our working media investments in Europe and frankly globally.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","All right, and then Irene, most companies have been reporting very slower growth in Brazil, Russia is a big question mark, China slowing down and yet you're reporting very strong growth in those markets almost no elasticity in Latin America despite close to 20% pricing, the company has a history of over-shipping consumption, why should we be comfortable that that these volumes performances are okay?","Irene Rosenfeld","","Well Eric, I would tell you Eric is that there is no question we are doing better than our categories in a number of these markets, we're very pleased with the impact that our marketing support has had that our innovation programs are having and that's been a key driver of our ability to outgrow the markets. We continue to watch the performance of the macro economy in key markets like Russia to make sure that our inventories are properly balanced and as I've shared with you in the past, we've got very good visibility and to that to make sure that our sell out and sell in are properly balanced, so we're very pleased with the performance of our businesses in some of these markets where the macro economies have suffered, but I think it's partly because we're taking a number of steps to control our own destiny in those markets with respect to the marketing support and the inputs that we're providing.","Dave Brearton","","And I think Eric, just to follow on that. The categories in our BRIC markets are holding up surprisingly well as the GDP is pretty dismal in a lot of those markets but surprisingly our categories remain strong growing roughly in the mid single digit. And we gained share in most of the categories we compete in the BRIC markets, so we got to watch it very carefully, a couple of years ago we did have some examples of over-shipping in China, but I think as we look at it today we kept pretty tight control on the trade stock situation. We're very aware that the categories are sort of defined gradually at this point we're watching it very closely that I think we're probably a key part of the innovation and investments Irene mentioned.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Great, and then if I could sorry, just one more Dave before you go, something I always asked about, but nine months using your own press release nine months free cash flow is only 40 million yet you've reported 2.2 billion of adjusted net income and you\u2019re saying that you are still going to get to the 3.7 billion over the two years, I look like working capital was a massive use in the quarter. How do you bridge that gap and deliver? I don\u2019t see how fourth quarter can be such a big positive swing versus almost no cash flow year-to-date or free cash flow, I should say?","Dave Brearton","The $3.7 billion was a number that excluded a couple of key items. It excluded the Starbucks gain last year 1.7 billion after tax. It excluded the actual tax payments on that Starbucks gain and excluded the debt tender class of that we use that gain to be able to execute given the tax situation that gave us, so included restructuring, it included all the other noise, but I think specially around those items tied to the Starbucks gain it was not part of that. I think if you included all those things 3.7 would actually be higher, but within that Starbucks gain obviously came last year and roughly $800 million of the tax payment on Starbucks gain and the debt tender cost in the first quarter this year.","So if you take all that out, we would be up about 800 million on the quarter and that gives well on track to the 1.4 billion we needed to get the 2 year 3.7 billion target. If you want all throw all that back in we would have a much higher cash flow target, than we have talked about in the past last year and it would balance out a bit some of those spending this year. But we\u2019re well on track, I mean, our cash flow we\u2019re quite happy with where we are. The working capital is up versus December 31st but that\u2019s normal.","December, due to the seasonality of our business is always our lowest working capital quarter and it always has been and September actually is leading into the heavy quarter for season. So we have higher inventories and we started to see higher receivables come through in September. So that\u2019s a fairly normal situation. When you look at it on a day\u2019s basis, we\u2019re down as I said on the earlier about 20 days on our cash conversion cycle, so the working capital performance has been quite good. But when you compare it to December, you\u2019ll always see working capital increase particularly third quarter and tends to the peak.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Thank you very much and David best wishes to you. I guess when I look at how this year is progressing gross profit dollars will actually be down for the year but David you said that there has been a lot of productivity gains and that you\u2019re on track in your supply chain reinvention, so I guess I wanted to know if you could help us quantify what those productivity benefits are and maybe explain why they\u2019re not improving gross profit dollars just yet? And then secondly on the SG&A, it\u2019s very encouraging to see so much productivity on SG&A line, I just wanted to get a sense of what we can expect for next year on that line because some of these advertising efficiency improvements it\u2019s hard to see how you can do that in two years in a row but would love to see how ZBB is going to help? Thanks.","Dave Brearton","I guess on the first one, gross margin is down on a reported basis due to currency really. So currency obviously impacts the entire P&L and it does result in gross margin, dollar came down on a dollar basis. But I think if you strip out currency on a constant currency basis, as we said earlier, we\u2019re up about 3% on dollar basis. And that is a reflection of fully pricing to recover those commodities in Forex impact, which was a big number. And net productivity coming through at 2.5% of cost to goods sold, which is a record number and that really is the reason we\u2019re able to grow our gross margins and that\u2019s the reason we are fairly confident that we can continue to thrive margin growth going forward and offset pricing impact.","So we actually feel very good about the gross margin. I think you\u2019re looking at a reported Forex basis when we say it\u2019s down. On the SG&A, I think the ZBB process as Irene said is really, it started this year around mostly just making people aware and trying to take its new approach to looking at things. We\u2019re in our first cycle of building budget that way, so I think we\u2019d expect to the savings continue and build into 2015. Specifically on the A&C line, you\u2019re right I think most of the low hanging fruit would have come this year, but will be a carryover benefit to some of that carrying over to next year when we get the full year benefit. But I think you will see more of the ZBB savings on the overhead line and less A&C next year, but I think if we\u2019ll build as we go through the year as well.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Do you have a top line or a top down target for ZBB savings for next year kind of like something that you\u2019re thinking of?","Dave Brearton","We do but we\u2019re not going to give you on 2015 guidance today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Another years not over yet but it feels like the majority the EBIT margin growth this year has been and will be SG&A productivity, wondering heading into the next year will those changes internally which may have been distracting, are you getting past what perhaps might have been traumatic or at least appear to change in internal review for you marking selling function as well general overhead function, and perhaps getting more on your front foot as you head into 15, any comments on that would be helpful? Thanks.","Irene Rosenfeld","I think there is no question we\u2019re starting to see the result of all of our transformation initiatives coming together and I think we\u2019re feeling very good about the progress that we have made year-to-date. And as I said in my remarks, we don\u2019t expect a dramatic change in the macro-environment as we look ahead so that we anticipate continuing to leverage this approach. So I think it's clearly we are beginning to make consciousness cost reduction productivity a part of the DNA, we are starting to see it play through, it's a critical piece and a critical driver of our margins as we look ahead. And I had every confidence that that will continue to play through as we look to the future. The facts are though we haven't begun yet to implement the new organization model which I mentioned will happen as of January 1st 2015 and I think that will be a further help to our overall ability to deliver the targets that we've laid out. ","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","And then separately in the United States how would you explain the slowing that we are seeing in the U.S. biscuit category in cookies and crackers. Do you have any thoughts there?","Irene Rosenfeld","","We had a really strong run in our biscuit business and I am very pleased with the performance that they've delivered. Our revenue has been growing about 4% to 5% for the past couple of years and it has been driven by some fabulous marketing execution as well as a very strong DSD selling organization. We are seeing a category growth slowing from about 2% to 3% but we've been outgrowing the category for quite some time it\u2019s now down about 1% to 2% and we think that's probably likely to be a factor in the near term as the consumer particularly in North America wrestles with the tough economy that some of these are discretionary purchases and we think it has some impact on our categories. Our focus is going to be continuing to innovate and drive our share within that larger macro-economy as well as continuing to make very significant progress on the margin front. ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hey, good morning and Dave congratulations, wish you well going forward. I had a question sort of following up on some of the items that people are focused on this morning on just gross profits and gross margins. And so I guess couple of things I would like to get some comments on first, just how much of your commodity exposure is currently locked in for this year and is there anything that's kind of locked in for next year. Just trying to get a sense on visibility on commodity costs?","Dave Brearton","","Yes, I don\u2019t think we will give you our hedging policy that would cross the line but I think it's fair to say that for this year we are a 100% locked in, there is really not much exposure. I think on our commodity coverage, our strategy is to cover until we believe we can price. That tends to be how we do our commodity and Forex coverage decisions. And the only caveat for that is in many emerging markets, it's quite difficult to get some of the currency hedges you'd like to get in place. But that's our overall strategy is to try to hedge until we can price.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess looking at just the foreign currency transaction impact that really wasn't very much of a factor in Q3. Is that a potential headwind for 2015 or even for 4Q in 2015 going forward?","Dave Brearton ","","Actually the foreign currency transaction impact is what we talk about when we say our commodity and we are going to price away commodities and Forex impacts. That is Forex transaction and that was about half of the high single digit cost increase I referred to. So it was material primarily in emerging markets obviously with some of the latest moves over the last month that will become more of a factor in Europe but it already has been a significant factor in cost movement this year.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then in terms of pricing, have you already priced, have you basically taken all the pricing you need so far based on what you know in terms of commodity costs and FX transactions. Obviously now knowing what's going to happen down the road. Just trying to make a sense is you've been putting pricing in for the second quarter, the third quarter. From now are you primarily done with that or is there still more new pricing that has to be instituted?","Dave Brearton","It varies a lot by market and category but the I guess two parts of we have announced more price increases in some markets but none of that is required to hit the quarter four, so that's more about making sure we continue to stay on the cost curve as we go into next year. So that there is more pricing coming through but it\u2019s not necessary to hit the quarter four guidance we just gave you. ","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citi","","Great, thank you and good morning everyone. Dave I would like to add my congratulations and best of luck on the new role and I appreciate all the assistance over the years. What I would like to ask you is Irene on the margin front, and I think you've said this before but I get this question all the time, is the weak volume environment, does it concern you to a degree of being able to achieve your long-term margin targets?","Irene Rosenfeld","David, I feel quite confident as we think about our long-term strategy. We are confident that we will be able to deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth. We have very strong categories even when they slow down, they are still growing faster than most other food categories. Our brands are strong, we have strong market positions in our key markets and we've got a very good geographic footprint particularly with respect to emerging market. So I think the fundamental elements that we have that comprise our portfolio will still suggest that we have the potential to grow at a very healthy rate over the long-term. In this challenging environment though we have chosen to focus on what we can control and that is driving productivity and aggressive cost reduction and that's what's fueling our earnings in the short term. So over the long term I feel quite confident that we've got the right element to be able to deliver top tier growth on both of the top and bottom lines, but in the near term while we see the macro-economy in its current condition, we're choosing to focus on what we can control which is primarily the cost.","David Driscoll - Citi","","Well maybe if I could you said a lot right there, so maybe if I could just clarify as best I can is that the 15% to 16% margin target is predominantly based upon things that you can control internally and that with year to date volumes down I think its 1.8% that's not a killer in being able to achieve those targets, is that just a fair statement?","Irene Rosenfeld","","That is a fair statement, as I've said in my remarks, we do not expect a dramatic change in the macro-environment or in our trends and therefore we anticipate continuing to leverage the approach that is working so well for us right now as we head into 2015 that said we're continuing to make the necessary and high return foundational investment so that as our markets recover particularly in the emerging markets we're able to benefit from that but I would suggest obviously we're not giving a 2015 guidance today but I would say that the algorithm and the approach that we're taking here is serving us well and will serve us well for the foreseeable future.","David Driscoll - Citi","","One last one for me, just a little one, I think you said that China saw mid single digit growth there and those numbers have been very volatile because of last year's Golden Oreo launch the quarterly numbers have been very volatile, is the right way to think about China at this point kind of a mid single digit grower going forward at least in the next handful of quarters is that a reasonable way to think about China now?","Irene Rosenfeld","","No I'm not going to give market by market guidance, but I would say that this is an unusual quarter because of the year ago comp in terms of the inventory destock, so as I said we're starting to see some early signs of success and response for our marketing programs, we expect that that will build, but it's going to be a slow build, we've got some work to do in China.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","","Hey good morning folks. First quick housekeeping item, can you give us some of the puts and takes that are going to weigh on EPS for the fourth quarter, your guidance sort of suggest that it's going to be down a couple of cents year on year?","Dave Brearton","","Yes, I think essentially what we're projecting for the fourth quarter would be interest roughly in line of with what you saw in the third quarter. The tax rates probably around the 20 low 20s range, because we don\u2019t see a lot of the discrete items coming in the fourth quarter and operating income margin mathematically to get to around 13% in the year would need to be in the high 13s, so that's kind of the composition of the quarter four.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. I want to turn to productivity, I know there's been a lot of questions on this, but your Mexican facility coming online, can you give us a sense of how much volume or what percentage of your volume in the North America and Lat-Am's going to be flowing to this facility and then once this comes online, what are the next steps in terms of attacking your legacy North American infrastructure?","Dave Brearton","","I think we've done a fair bid there, what we said about the Salinas facility it's all about growth volume so what is going into that facility is growth on our core Oreo, belVita and Ritz lines and that's really how we're going to fill up those pipelines three of them are coming up this quarter. So that is that's really what that is about, so the vast majority of the volume will still come out of the legacy facility, beyond that though we also announced earlier this year that we would be closing the Philadelphia's facility and investing money in both our Richmond and Fairmont facilities to upgrade those legacy facilities. So I think our margin improvement program in North America is for Salinas but also making sure we have the right network here in the U.S. ","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Okay and real quick last one, gum, it's been a while since you guys talked about the category how it's doing and how you're doing in the category, can you give us an update?","Irene Rosenfeld","","Gum is about 8% of our revenue today and about half of it today is now in emerging markets and the good news is that the category continues to be generally quite robust in the emerging markets, if you look at our year-to-date trends they're not as strong as because of the net impact of the Mexican VAT on the gum category if you recall it's about a 16% VAT which obviously in the short term's having a profound impact on the Mexican gum category, but in aggregate ex-Mexico, our emerging markets are growing over 5%, so we feel quite good about the profile in the emerging markets and we are starting to see the impact of a number of our near term programs on our share performance over half of our shares are growing or holding and particularly in China which is the basically the number two gum market in the world, we continue to see very strong performance that's going to be about a $150 million business for us this year. So net-net we haven't solved the longer term macro trends in developed markets, but as our shifts increasingly to the emerging markets, we feel quite confident that we'll continue to benefit from the growth there.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","","Just echo what everyone else said and good luck to Dave. First question, just on the regions, on Asia specifically, organic sales growth was up 1.3%, but China was up high single. Australia\/New Zealand was positive. India was quite strong. So just trying to reconcile those -- the importance of those markets and curious what other markets or factors weighed on the overall region and how sustainable those issues might be?","Dave Brearton ","I think the other two areas of the region would be Japan which is primarily the market and I think the category we did very well on share, but the category then decline and probably we\u2019ll continue to decline because of aging population demographics. And other one is Southeast Asia and I think the news in the quarter there was around Malaysia and there was a report that was inaccurate that said our chocolate wasn\u2019t Halal and that caused their volumes to go down and then third quarter in Malaysia, we\u2019re in the process of working through that and clarifying with our consumer but nothing really has changed, but it has an impact on the very quarter shipments. So those would be the two other items in Asia.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley ","Okay, thanks, Dave. Brian, if I could ask you one other quick question, if it's one you can answer. Even though you are not formally in the CFO role yet, now that you have been named to the post, are you actively involved in the 2015 budget process and the ongoing process of assessing the business outlook and setting guidance?","Brian Gladden","Absolutely, I mean, we spent the last couple of weeks in a lot of deeper views really focused 2015, so that\u2019s been a primary focus, and David and I have spent a lot of time together.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Can I ask about the impact of SKU rationalization? I know I guess this time last year, there was a comment that you were starting with 74,000 SKUs globally and an expectation that would be reduced quite significantly over the next two or three years. Is that hitting your topline today? Will it continue to hit somewhat over the next year or so? Can you give us any idea, now that you are a year into this rationalization, just how much those numbers might come down over time? Thank you.","Dave Brearton ","I think the rationalization we\u2019ve talked about is probably most advanced in Europe and yes it is included in both results as well as the guidance we gave going forward. I would expect us to continue to do that. Any good company is just good housekeeping that continued cleaning up SKUs and so I think you\u2019ll continue to see those things and any guidance that we give you will include the impact of that SKU rationalization.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","But given that -- I think there was a conversation about meaningful 20%, 30% reductions, in some cases. Do you have an idea about what the endpoint here is or what the number could go down to over the longer term?","Dave Brearton ","I think our comment on the 20% to 30% was specifically around the couple of programs we had in Europe and we\u2019re on track to deliver that. I don\u2019t think we give any total SKU number, but I think you can expect us to take kind of European program and apply that logic elsewhere. And importantly SKU reduction can result in top line impact. It can actually just clean up the shelves and help us drive growth going forward, so it isn\u2019t necessarily a revenue hit, it can be and if it was to some degree this year in Europe, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be. So we\u2019ll continue to apply those principles are actually quite tightly to the supply chain reinvention program we\u2019ve gotten. The key part of is enabling Daniel Myers to streamline the network.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","I just had two quick follow-up questions. One is last quarter; you guys reduced the OI growth rate. Now you are actually going and actually raising it. Can you isolate one to three reasons of what are the major changes of going from one quarter to another quarter in terms of the outlook on that?","Dave Brearton ","I think last quarter what we did is we called down our revenue guidance and we kept our margin guidance. So mathematically that means we have to reduce our OI growth rate. This quarter we kept the revenue guidance, we had very good margin performance in quarter 3 and we essentially said we think we can keep that and carry that forward in the quarter 4 and we increased margin guidance. So I think we\u2019re just frankly keeping you up-to-date as the world unfolds our guidance today is really around sticking up to 2% to 2.5% revenue growth rate on the top line and taking our margins up around 13% on the OI level and that results in the higher OI growth rate.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","Let me ask it another way. Did you accelerate the ZBB? Is there something that came in earlier than expected? Was there a little bit less elasticity? Was there certain rebound in emerging markets or something that has happened at all during the quarter that has changed your view, particularly on the ZBB side?","Dave Brearton ","I think ZBB is probably the thing I would think a lot with saying we\u2019ve had a good performance in overhead all year. But I think we\u2019re making better progress year to date and then we originally expect this to get the single out one thing that caused us to raise our margin guidance this year that would be it.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","Then my final question is, can you give us an update on the size of the gaps, where they were -- or some key markets, and where they stand now and where you hope them to be? What are the actual progress of the price gaps, because you said that has actually come in in emerging markets, and I was just curious to see what the progression has been and are you at the state where you need to be?","Dave Brearton ","I think two answers to that. In the emerging markets, we priced when commodity and Forex impact hit, many of our competitors either didn\u2019t price or price significantly later than we did that\u2019s mostly trued up by now. The price gaps in emerging markets are largely back in line the competition either priced or downsized to reflect the cost increases. Where it is still out of line would be in European chocolates where we have priced to reflect the quantity and Forex impacts and most of the competition has not and so we\u2019re still out of line in Europe. On those we would expect overtime the competition will need to reflect the realities at the new cost levels. But as we sit here today, there is still a price gaps in European chocolate, that's the one outlier. I think the rest of the business feels pretty good.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for question-and-answers. I will now turn the call to Dexter Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. ","Dexter Congbalay","","Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Good afternoon up here in Europe. Nick and I will be around for the rest of the day to take any calls, or frankly for the rest of the week. But then again have a good day. ","Operator","","Thank you.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by the Mondel\u0113z management and the question-and-answer session.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z. Please go ahead sir.","Shep Dunlap - Mondelez International, Inc.","Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; Brian Gladden, our outgoing CFO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO beginning August 1.","Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.

Today, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you, Shep. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. We delivered a strong second quarter building on the momentum we saw in the first quarter. We generated solid topline growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. Organic net revenue grew 3.5% driven by both positive volume growth and solid pricing. This includes a positive impact from lapping last year's malware incident. Our growth was broad based across our regions and categories. This revenue growth translated into a strong bottom-line performance.","Adjusted operating income grew more than 10%, and margin expanded to 16.7%, up 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS increased almost 15% at constant currency. We remain encouraged by industry trends. Snacking growth is improving globally and our categories are up above 3%. It's particularly encouraging to see that this growth was coming from both developed and emerging markets. As you know, we have a broad geographic footprint and generate a significant majority of our revenue outside of North America.","In a majority of countries around the world, we have a leading position in the highly attractive snacking category as we have a stable of iconic global and local brands. Seeing our categories grow largely everywhere around the world gives me confidence in our ability to drive growth going forward. As I've said over the past eight months, the key to unlocking more value for our shareholders is based on two simple core concept: putting the consumer at the center of everything we do and executing with excellence every day.","These concepts are fundamental to our strategy and our long-term growth framework which we will talk about in September. Now, I'd like to highlight a few areas that demonstrate strength and continued progress across our geographies and categories. Starting in Europe, we delivered another solid quarter with strong volume growth.","Our biscuit business delivered strong volume growth across most of Western Europe including Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Our chocolate brands Milka, Toblerone and C\u00f4te d'Or also performed well. And chocobakery, which includes Milka and Cadbury biscuits, continued its momentum.","Once again, Germany was a particular standout which was up double-digits. Our Milka biscuits brand is gaining strong consumer appeal across the country, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to expand these products into our other regions.","In France, where we've been running a successful Oreo marketing campaign, volumes were up mid-single digit. In Eastern Europe, we continue to experience strong chocolate growth, largely thanks to the strength of Milka. We also saw strong revenue growth in Russia fueled by the continued success of the Alpen Gold Dark and the Milka Dark launches as well as activations around the World Cup.","Switching to North America. Organic revenue was up 5.7%, which is partially driven by lapping the malware incident from last year. Recent innovations like Oreo Thins Bites and Ritz Crisp & Thins have performed well. Our new innovation strategy is to start small experiment and bring brands to scale based on what we learn in the local markets. An example of this would be Trident White, which we launched in the few markets this May. We are encouraged by our progress in North America with expanding margins and improving trends in our U.S. biscuits business. However, there is still more work to do.","Turning to AMEA. We continue to perform well across a number of key areas where we delivered volume growth and share gains. India continued its run of double-digit revenue growth supported by strong volume. Expanded distribution in traditional trade, successful innovation and strong execution have been driving market share gains, underscoring our market leadership in Indian chocolate.","In China, we delivered mid-single-digit growth. We posted good results in biscuits and turned another good quarter of growth and share improvement in gum. Our eCommerce platform in China continues to grow, driven by gifting and personalization.","In Latin America, we delivered mid-single-digit growth. Mexico led by strength in both biscuits and gum turned in solid results. And similar to many other companies, our Brazil business was meaningfully impacted by the trucker strike, which contributed to a high single-digit decline in revenue. While we are positive on a longer term outlook for Brazil, we do expect continued volatility for the remainder of the year.","Over the past quarter, we also opened two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, one in the Czech Republic and one in Bahrain, both focused on servicing our emerging market growth. The factory in Opava, Czech Republic, which will manufacture brands like Oreo, belVita, Milka and Cadbury biscuits, is a great example of our strong commitment to building a positive impact for people and our planet.","Operating as a zero waste to landfill facility, the plant uses as little energy and water as possible. The Oreo cookies that are produced here use sustainable cocoa sourced through our Cocoa Life program. And the wheat used in the biscuits is increasingly sourced through our Harmony program which promotes biodiversity and clean environmental wheat production in Europe. We are very excited about this program. And last month, we announced plans to expand our Harmony program to cover 100% of European biscuits by 2022.","I also wanted to call out two important events that have happened since our last call. First, we closed the acquisition of Tate's Bake Shop late in the quarter. Tate's is a great fit with our portfolio of iconic brands. It expands our exposure to the fast growing premium cookie segment with an entrepreneurial theme that has created an authentic brand with truly delicious product. Tate's is off to a great start as part of Mondel\u0113z International, and we look forward to introducing this exceptional brand to even more consumers.","Second, in early July, the Keurig Dr Pepper acquisition was completed. We have 13.8% ownership in that business. Our coffee investments have been good contributors to the company, and we'll talk more about them in our September Investor Meeting. Going forward, our focus remains on executing with excellence and finalizing our strategic review. We look forward to sharing more details regarding our plans with you at our Investor Day in September.","Before turning it over to Brian, I want to extend my gratitude to him as he has been an invaluable partner since I joined the company. During his tenure, Brian's leadership and financial discipline has played a critical role in our journey to become the world's best snacking company. He has built a world-class financial organization, and I know that we are in great hands with Luca Zaramella assuming the role of CFO.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to share more details on the quarter.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Dirk, and good afternoon. We delivered solid topline and bottom line results in the second quarter. We continued to see positive momentum in most of our markets and posted broad-based revenue growth across regions and categories.","Organic net revenue increased 3.5% driven in large part by volume growth and balanced pricing. This includes approximately 160 basis points relating to three factors: the positive effect of lapping last year's malware event, the negative impact of the Easter shift into the first quarter and the negative impact from the trucker strike in Brazil during this quarter.","Similarly, for the first half, our organic net revenue growth was 2.9% including approximately 100 basis points from the previously mentioned items. Both developed and emerging markets continued to perform well for us during the quarter. Our developed markets were up 2.5% in the quarter while our strong emerging market footprint continued to deliver for us, with organic net revenues increasing 4.7% with positive volume growth.","On a regional basis for the quarter, Europe's organic net revenue increased 2.8% and was volume driven. We continued to deliver strong results in the region with notable growth in key countries like Germany and Russia which both grew double digits in biscuits and chocolate. AMEA grew 1.7% driven by double-digit growth in India and solid growth in China. This strength was tempered by a weaker Ramadan season in the Middle East and soft results in Australia.","Latin America grew 3.8% with mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and currency driven pricing in Argentina. This was partially offset by the impact of the trucker strike in Brazil that lasted 11 days during May and early June which resulted in shipping delays and lost consumption.","North America increased 5.7% which reflects the lapping of last year's malware incident. Growth was driven by solid biscuit results which were partially offset by weak performance in gum. We're encouraged with the progress in North America. But there's still significant work ahead and we expect to see gradual improvement in this region as we move forward.","Now let's review our margin performance. We expanded adjusted OI margins by 130 basis points to 16.7%. Higher gross margins and continued SG&A improvements drove these results. Gross margins expanded due to net productivity, volume leverage and sequentially improving commodity costs as we expected. We continued to execute on our ZBB program while selectively investing in key growth activities in our SG&A spend.","On a regional basis, gross margin expansion and cost execution drove margin improvements in three of four regions. Europe margins grew 110 basis points to 19.2%. North America increased by 130 basis points to 20.8% driven by volume leverage and lower SG&A. Latin America increased by 120 basis points to 15.4%. And AMEA declined by 40 basis points to 15% as a result of lapping a one-time property insurance recovery in the prior year.","Moving to category highlights. The snacking category continues to demonstrate healthy momentum building on the past three quarters with growth of more than 3%. Year-to-date, our biscuits revenue grew 4.3% with strength in the U.S., France, Russia and China. Approximately 80% of our revenue grew or held share in this category.","In chocolate, our business remains robust growing 4%. India and Russia delivered double-digit growth while Germany and UK delivered solid results. Approximately 60% of our revenue grew or held share in this category.","Gum and candy grew less than 1% as the candy business posted low single-digit growth offset partially by soft but improving gum results. Gum declined in developed markets partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in emerging markets. About 40% of our revenue in this business gained or held share.","Turning to earnings per share. We delivered another strong quarter of adjusted EPS growth increasing nearly 15% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by solid volume-driven revenue growth, gross margin improvement and SG&A discipline. We returned approximately $1 billion in capital to shareholders during the quarter and $1.8 billion year-to-date. For the quarter, we repurchased $650 million in stock and paid more than $300 million in cash dividends.","In addition, we announced an increase in our dividend of 18% today as we continued to deliver dividend growth that is greater than earnings. Our dividend is up more than 50% over the past three years.","Turning to free cash flow. The second quarter was a solid quarter of cash flow generation for the company, driven by continued strong working capital execution and higher cash earnings. Year-to-date, we've generated $650 million in free cash flow which is approximately $900 million more than the first half of last year. Our team remains focused on delivering approximately $2.8 billion in free cash flow for full year 2018.","Now, turning to our outlook for the year. We're encouraged by the category growth trends as well as our own revenue growth on a year-to-date basis. Both of these measures are better than our initial expectations coming into the year. On the other side, we see Brazil which represents about 6% of our revenue as more challenging than expected. Taking this into consideration, we're raising our topline outlook and now expect organic net revenue growth at the high end of our stated range of 1% to 2%.","Looking ahead, I'd remind you that the comparisons in the second half are more challenging given category growth comparisons and the positive prior year impact of malware-related shipments. With respect to our adjusted margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow commitments, we are maintaining our outlook for the year.","Before I turn things over to Dirk to open it up for Q&A, I'd like to make a couple comments regarding the transition of my role to Luca who will assume the CFO position next week on August 1. I believe the company and our shareholders are in great hands with Luca as our new CFO.","He has a strong track record of success over the past 20 years with the company and a deep knowledge of our products, markets, operations, competitors and customers. I've had the opportunity to work closely with him over my time at Mondel\u0113z and have incredible respect for his expertise and knowledge. I'm sure you will all enjoy working with Luca.","I'll now turn it over to him to say a few words.","Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. It's a great honor and privilege for me to be the next CFO of Mondel\u0113z. I have a great belief in this company and I am excited to take on this role after over two decades of building my career working across the company.","I've had the opportunity to see emerging and developed markets across Europe, Latin America as well as in North America in corporate. I'm happy to be working with Dirk and excited to enter the next phase of this company. I have personally learned a great deal from Brian and benefited from his leadership and counsel over the past few years, and I look forward to getting to know those on the call over the coming months and quarters.","I'll now turn it over to Dirk for some closing comments.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Luca. Thanks, Brian. In closing, while we continue to see some volatility across a few emerging markets, we feel very good about the progress we've made in both developed and developing markets. Our business in Europe continue to perform well, and while there is more work we need to do in North America, we are working hard to drive improvement in the region and seeing progress.","Developing markets across AMEA and Latin America have mostly improved over the past several quarters except for Brazil, which is expected to remain challenging over the near term. I am encouraged by the momentum that we are seeing in the business and with the strong first half results. We're making good progress with our strategic review and are looking forward to sharing this work in early September.","And with that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. And, Brian, I want to wish you all the best going forward. It's been a real pleasure working with you, and Luca looking forward to working with you as well.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Brian.","Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you, Brian.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, I guess I have two questions relative to the revenue outlook balance of the year. First, I guess in North America, how much progress or how comfortable you feel now that you've got service levels back to the sort of levels that you'd expect going forward, meaning you've got back to full service levels? That is the first.","And then, second, I guess, as we're looking over the balance of the year, I understand the Brazil piece is \u2013 it could be a little bit challenging. But it just seems like with the momentum in the category getting better and the momentum potentially set up for improvement in North America as we go forward that why not go above the high end of the range on the organic revenue growth guide?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you, Bryan. I think you touched upon the two areas that, clearly, for the rest of the year require attention from our side. As it relates to North America, yes, we have made some progress. Our supply chain, which is one of the key things that we needed to work on and improve, has shown some good customer service results in the second quarter. And we're seeing some good momentum also from our DSD system.","It remains, however, a system that still has a few old plants in there, which are a bit finicky, so we feel good, but we need to keep on confirming for the rest of year that we have things under control, so we're a bit cautious. At the same time, we do see an increasing momentum in the categories in North America and our share performance within that has been better in the sense that biscuits is accelerating and we have increased a little bit our share. And as it relates to gum, the category is doing better and our share decline has improved a little bit.","So, yes, we are having a stronger topline. If you take out malware, we're now clearly in positive territory in North America. At the same time, for the remainder of the year, I would say that the comparisons are going to become more difficult because, as you will remember, the third quarter had a positive effect last year from malware, and just overall the comparisons become more difficult. So we feel good about our forecast for North America in the remainder of the year, and we want to see what next quarter brings us before thinking through if it should be higher.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. And maybe about the total company, clearly, we are encouraged by the evolution of the topline over the last three quarters and, as we said in the opening remarks, quite pleased about the fact that it is broad-based both in terms of categories and regions. Also pleased by the volume and price balance that we see. And in general, as you saw, we are improving our revenue outlook for the year.","In totality for the company, though, we want to remain thoughtful about the second half. There are still some elements of volatility in emerging markets, like Brazil, as we said. North America, good progress, as we've said but improvement is going to be gradual. And in terms of comparison, we're lapping higher growth in the second part of last year and also malware was a positive effect specifically in Q3 last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good evening, everybody, and all the best to you, Brian.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Wanted to follow up, Dirk, a little bit, I think you'd mentioned in the previous answer that the DSD system was starting to see some building momentum. And I'm just trying to get a sense of are there any, I guess, specific metrics that you can point to as of yet that sort of tell you that the company is starting to see maybe what could be a sort of sustainable or substantive advantage from having DSD vis-\u00e0-vis competitors that don't just because of all the malware issues? It seems that that's not obviously been able to be leveraged perhaps in a way that you'd like it to be over the last year.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yes, Andrew. Well, of course, the best measure for us is our share performance that this \u2013 what will give us the clearest measure. We also, of course, look at our customer service and things like out-of-stocks and so on and that is clearly improving for us. And I think also the fact that we are much more clear on our communication about the fact that we do believe in DSD and we think it can be a differentiator for us, that has caused us to get more confident in our themes (25:51).","If we go a little bit deeper, the things we typically look at is the number of displays that we have, what's going on with our share of shelf. And there we see a clear improvement and clear increases. So those are the different factors that we look at to be able to understand how DSD is doing for us.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you for that. And then, Brian, gross margin came in quite a bit better than we had modeled. Is part of that just that, I guess, the more positive mix effect from a stronger developed market performance in this quarter partially because of lapping malware as opposed to anything else because it sequentially improved quite a bit in terms of the year-over-year improvement?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, Andrew. That's part of it. Up 60 basis points, we feel pretty good about it. And I think we've been saying it as we move through the year that we expected to see gross margins get a bit better and we still expect them to be up for the total year. I would say mix has been helpful. Net productivity and the supply chain execution actually was good in the quarter. Sequentially, we had commodities moving in the right direction. As we said we had hedges that we're rolling off, gave us access to lower priced cocoa. That was helpful sequentially.","Dairy pricing, we've now pretty much got covered with pricing \u2013 or dairy increased inflation we have covered with pricing. And then volume leverage, I think, overall has contributed better absorption and better overall margin. So I think those are the key drivers. And as I said, we feel good about in the 70% commitment for the year that gross margins will still be up year-over-year, so good progress in the quarter.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Thank you and good evening. I wanted to ask about the non-Power Brands. I think in the quarter, you guys \u2013 but correct me if my math \u2013 because you don't actually print this on the slides, but I think maybe growth of the non-Power Brands was maybe a little bit less than 1%. Dirk, now that you've been with the company for a while, can you give us some comments as to what you see is the role of these non-Power Brands? Should they be kind of flattish or low growth? And do you need to invest more in them to get them moving?","And then just kind of the final point on this question is, if the answer is not positive to some of those then perhaps some of these should be divestiture candidates, as they would enhance the revenue growth on the residual business. I'd appreciate your thoughts.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yes, David. I would say the \u2013 and this is a little piece of what we're looking for at the new strategy and we will talk more about it in September. But the way I look at it is we are a company that is composed of Power Brands, which are global brands that are clearly on trend and that are doing well and provides the majority of our growth. But we have also a number of other brands, largely local brands. And those you can indeed divide up in two categories. There's the ones that are quite lost that have potential. They can play in authenticity or a health and wellness role. And we probably have not invested enough in them. And that's one of the areas where we are trying to make the change.","And then there is probably a number of them that are not as appealing and that really don't have a clear future. And yeah, we need to see what we need to do with those. You start to see already a little bit of that. Europe has started to shift some of their investments into some of those local brands and we're getting some good traction from that. So I don't think they're going to grow 3%, 4%. But to see them somewhere around 1%, maybe a little bit above that, on an ongoing basis, we would be quite happy if that is what these brands are going to do for us.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And then one follow-up. On the emerging markets, I think if I read the data right, volumes were down. How concerning is this? And do you expect volume growth to be positive for the emerging markets in the second half?","Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.","I think when you look at that, take into consideration the fact that in those numbers, there are a couple of drivers, one is Argentina, where clearly we price according to inflation and there is a volume implication there. The other one that came into play in the quarter, it is in the Philippines where we had to price for a beverage tax. And the pricing we took was quite high. It was around about 100%, so there was a volume impact. But we are quite pleased to see the likes of China, India, and Russia actually growing volume. And so in general, I would say, as you strip out some of the outliers I've just mentioned, we feel quite good with the volume momentum we see even in developing markets.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","And David, if you look at emerging in total, vol mix was positive, up 1% in the quarter.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much and, Brian, thanks for everything and good luck.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good evening, folks.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, Jason.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, Jason (31:19).","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. I'll just echo the sentiment, Brian congratulations, and it's great to see you walk out on a high note with the company kind of humming overall.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","In terms of the performance, it's great to see the sales accelerating. I know there's some noise in there. I think the disclosure in your slides, about 160 basis points of benefit this quarter on organic. Kind of dialing that back around 1.9%, I think for the quarter and for the year-to-date if we strip out that noise, which is relatively solid. But if we compare it to your end market growth of 3.1%, you're still lagging by around 100 basis points which is about where you've been lagging for the last few years.","Yet you're showing your percentage of sales at least in snacks that are gaining or holding, materially improving 65%. We haven't seen that I think since maybe 2013. What's the disconnect with those two data points? Why is your market share number kind of getting better? I presume the answer is \u2013 because that 35% that's losing is substantial. And if so, what are some of the drags? And how should we think about their impact going forward?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, Jason. It's Brian. I'll take it. And as you think about it, I think we sort of got the math at about 70 basis points disconnect between category growth and higher growth. And there's really two drivers. We are net-net still in aggregate losing some share. It's mostly in Brazil, U.S. gum contributes, and those are probably the two biggest. And then there's \u2013 as we talked about in the first quarter, there's an inventory trade reduction that played out in the North America business. Those are the two biggest drivers that would explain the delta. I'd say we feel pretty good about the fact that the share performance almost everywhere else in the world is actually improving and I think we see this gap closing over time.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Very good. That's helpful. You mentioned Brazil. Maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on there because as we listen to various companies, the messaging is kind of all over the place. So I'm suggesting it's better today than last year. So I'm suggesting it's still really choppy. What are you guys seeing in the marketplace? You kind of sound as somewhat cautionary note. Is that driven more by end market growth, more by market share? Can you just give us some more context and color around that?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yes. I would say first of all Brazil is important for us as it probably is for some other companies too. It's about 6% of our revenue. And we certainly see heightened volatility. You had the truckers strike in this quarter, which has kind of thrown off the quarter, probably had about a $20 million impact on the topline. We think that was lost consumption as the product was not in the store and the consumer really couldn't get to the store. We don't think in a category like snacking that is going to come back. So that's going to affect the rest of the year.","You've probably seen that the exchange rate also has started to move that is giving us some volatility. And there's also some social and political unrest in Brazil. So on the short term for the rest of the year, we're sort of expecting that the consumer confidence and the consumer behavior will be affected. And so we expect more disruption and bit of a difficult time for the second half of the year.","On top of that, we have \u2013 and maybe we've reported on this a few times, we're doing quite well in biscuits and in gum. But in the chocolate markets, we've had some heavy competitive pressure. So we're faced with that also. Longer term, I think, yes, the observation that Brazil is doing better that the GDP is improving. And I would say probably over the midterm, we are more positive about Brazil. But I wouldn't dare to say that the second half of the year will already bring us a much improved situation.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. Thanks a lot guys. I'll pass it on.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Okay.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. I guess I'll ask about the cocoa cost comment. You said that hedges rolled over, Brian, which was a benefit to gross margin in the second quarter. But we're all kind of looking at cocoa cost as being inflationary. I know you have hedges that protect you for a while and protect Mondel\u0113z for a while. So what's the outlook for when the costs start to get higher instead of lower for the margin profile?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I think Rob it's moved around a little bit. I mean it's actually down a little recently. When you look at it in the scale of sort of a five-year cycle of where cocoa has been, it's actually pretty reasonably priced. And we feel okay with that and we've been locking in a little bit longer than we otherwise would given that dynamic. It's going to be slightly favorable for us in the second half of the year sequentially and year-over-year. And then first half of next year, it feels about the same based on what we have kind of in place already.","So we're not really worried about where cocoa is. It hasn't moved a whole lot. I'd say dairy has come down a little bit. And if you look more broadly, not a whole lot of new changes to the commodity environment for us in terms of our key commodities. Crude oil has obviously moved up and that affects us in some parts of our supply chain. But we've got some long-term hedges in place there as well. So I mean as we said coming into the year, commodity's relatively benign year-over-year and I would say that's still the case.","I would say, as you would have heard from several other companies, clearly, there is some building inflation pressure in some other parts of the supply chain. When you look at logistics and packaging and even labor costs around the world, I would say that's looking to be more inflationary as you move over the next couple of years. And that's something that as we look at the strat plan and start talking about how we plan the business, we're going to have to take into account. But as you look at 2018, I'd say relatively benign right now.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Can I ask you to opine on weak inflation also in your last conference call here as CFO?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Going forward or what we're seeing right now?","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","What you're seeing right now.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Not a big challenge for us.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Not a big challenge. Okay. Best wishes, Brian. Great working with you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks a lot, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And Brian, I'll add my congratulations as well. Wish you all the best.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","(38:31).","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I want to ask if I could \u2013 sure \u2013 about emerging markets and discussion before about volume being up in emerging markets. I'm curious if you took out Brazil, how much of weight was that on sales growth for the quarter? Emerging markets are still pretty solid, just a little below where they were in the first quarter. So I'm just trying to get a little sense of how that one market might've really distorted the data this quarter?","Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. I think Brazil, clearly, was impacted by the trucker strike. We feel quite good about majority of the emerging markets. You look at Russia, Russia grew quite highly about 15% in the quarter. So it was quite a good number. We are gaining share. The categories are doing well. India the same, volume driven growth. China, mid single-digit growth. So, in general, as we look at developing markets, I think we feel quite good. So I would say that excluding Brazil and the couple of other markets, namely some markets in the Middle East, all the rest grew solidly in Q2.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yes.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just a quick question if I could in relation to, some of the SG&A related savings, some of the benefit coming through to the operating margin, are those cost saving driven? I guess related to that, I'm curious if you're \u2013 are you moving some of your advertising dollars up to promotional spending still into (39:53) something you've done earlier in the year. I'm just curious how that's playing out and where you're investing those dollars.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say two things. I mean we continue to work overheads and ZBB continues to deliver for us. We are reinvesting some dollars within overheads into some growth activities. And then A&C, I'd say A&C is down slightly in the quarter, and I'd say mostly timing related. As we've said, we expect the total year to be roughly flat with 2017, and we'll probably have some higher spending in the second half of the year.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good evening, and all the best, Brian.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Dirk, just a follow-up to your answer to Jason's question on Brazil. It sounded like the trucking strike hit your shelf presence and the comment was or at least part of this was that that would have a carryover impact to consumption, am I getting that right? And does that mean the trucking strike is hurting certain players, like Mondel\u0113z, more than others, meaning this is having a carryover effect to market share rather than just a category or a consumer issue?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","No, no. What I meant is that during those 11 days, the consumer bought less product because on one hand there was less product available, on the other hand, since it was a massive issue, consumers didn't get to the store. Since we're in snacking and in foods market, if they don't have their cookies for today, they won't eat them and they won't catch up going forward. They will still consume going forward. But those 11 days, we probably have lost for the year. But there's no ongoing effect of consumption for us.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Shouldn't be an impact in the second half at all.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the comments you made about the Middle East and the weaker Ramadan season weighing on the India results. How much of the slowdown in the quarter was a transitory issue and what is your general outlook for that region? Thanks.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Well, I would say that if I look at AMEA overall, all the signs are very positive. For the first half, AMEA is up 2.7%. We have very good growth in India with double-digit. We have China, mid-single digits. South East Asia is also growing quite solidly. So it really boils down to the Middle East and Australia. Middle East, it has declined double-digits because of the category softness and also some of the economic conditions. The Middle East has been a tough region for us. For a longer period of time, a lot of the subsidies are gone and some of the competitors didn't price and so on. So on top of that, we were cautious with our Ramadan season. And so we see some effect of that.","Australia also declined. That was due to Easter phasing, some challenging market conditions and increased competitive activity. I'm expecting Australia to come back. The Middle East, the softer Ramadan of course will not continue. But it's still a region where clearly consumer confidence and consumer spending is affected at the moment.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","And I think, David, we managed the Ramadan fairly well, I mean to the point where I don't see a carryover inventory challenge with how we manage through Ramadan. I think we were cautious coming into the season.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Two questions for me. One is a clarification on going back over Brazil. It's very clear that the consumption \u2013 the lost consumption for 11 days. But what I'm trying to get a better feel for is are you commenting that as a result of that strike, was your loss broader consumer confidence loss in that region that is impairing maybe out the door consumption trends for the remainder of the year along with politics and on a local and regional basis? Can you just clarify, if there's any broader underlying trend change for the consumer?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. No, I wouldn't say that I see a bigger effect on consumer confidence or consumer spending going forward. We do have a little bit of a devaluation, so that will affect consumer prices in Brazil. But apart from that, I think we remain cautious, but we do not see any signs that consumer offtake is affected in a major way. Of course, you have the elections that are coming up which causes usually some volatility, especially in the run-up to the election. So that's why we are a \u2013 for all those reasons, we are a little bit cautious at the moment. But at this stage, we don't see an effect on the consumer offtake.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. And then getting back to a question that Jason English asked, to get to that end market, 3% category growth rate over the medium to longer term, does that require dipping into maybe some lower margin pockets of growth, lower ASP products to really capture that runway? Or do you not view them as mutually exclusive and if you fix the U.S. and fix Brazil that you should be able to find that runway and still be able to expand margins simultaneously? Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yes, yes. We don't see the \u2013 the first thing you mentioned, we don't necessarily see that as a must to get to that 3% growth. I think if we can get the U.S. closer to the market growth and the same in Brazil, we should be very close to the 3% market growth.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for the question. Brian, I wanted to come back to margins for a second and specifically gum and candy. And actually remember, Cadbury became pretty aggressive in attacking the overheads there prior to the acquisition. And now after owning the business for almost a decade, I also think you've done quite a bit in terms of getting the systems in back offices where they need to be. So can you just talk a little bit about how the cost structure benchmarks in the G&C business, where you see the opportunities for further margin expansion going forward and how we just think about the drivers there?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. Look, John, I think the gum and candy business continues to be a very high margin business for us. And I think as we've looked at it over time, there are some elements of that business that have a higher cost structure. I mean it's a more intense go-to-market model. The route to market costs more. But as you think about the core gross margins of the business, it's still a very good business.","And I think over time, as we've seen the growth slow and the category shrink in some cases, we have taken some costs out. And we've worked to try and maintain those margins. So, it is still a contributor to the P&L. It still drives very strong cash flow, and it's still a good margin business. And I think over time, we have continued to take more cost out, and it has benefited from a lot of the bigger cost reductions and G&A reductions that we've done across the whole company as well.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Going forward in terms of the SG&A, what are you seeing of the further opportunities there? I mean is it more on the outsourcing side with the sales function or...?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","For the whole company, John?","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, just gum and candy.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. Look I think that will be a topic that I know that Dirk and Luca and the team will talk to you about how we think about gum. It's still in some markets. It continues to be a pretty important element of our go-to-market capability and the scale that we have in those markets. So I think there's places where there are opportunities to grow. And as you know that business in the emerging markets, those guys continue to show growth for us. So continued growth in some of the emerging markets with high margins, that's a good thing. But you can expect to hear more about that I think in September with the team.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Brian. All the best.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","All right. Thanks, John.","Operator","And at this time, we have time for one more question. The final question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Brian, best of luck to you and congratulations.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And my question is just kind of layering on the last question was can you talk about the anecdotes or what you're doing in Europe to actually enhance the margins because \u2013 is it a closure of facilities, is there a utilization rate that you're actually improving, is it simple sourcing? It seems like there still is plenty of opportunity in Europe. So you can give \u2013 I know you don't want to go forward, but can you give some anecdotes and some history of where we're going with this and some of the examples of what you're doing?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, Ken. Look, it's \u2013 I think much of the agenda in Europe has been what we've talked about on a global basis, right. So supply chain reinvention, building capacity and capability with lines of the future that have lower conversion costs and more efficiency, we've obviously done that and added capability in Europe. We've also closed down some facilities and that's contributed as well. They have been as you've seen sort of the best example of a place where we've seen volume growth that's given us leverage in the P&L and that's helped the margins as well.","Everything we've done with shared services and G&A reductions, Europe has done that too. So I think it's the broader global agenda coupled with volume growth and a good starting point from a competitive standpoint has really helped that business to shine. And as we look at the margins in the Europe business, they compare incredibly well to other peer companies in Europe and the team has done a very good job with that.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I agree with you. And I guess my point more than anything else is as the margins have expanded to the level they have and as you said they are exceeding your peers but it doesn't sound like there's really a limit or a near-term limit to them. Is that a fair way of thinking that or is there a reduction or a deceleration of margin expansion opportunities?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Well, I think there's a fair portion of that that's been the transformation of the company has contributed. So with a restructuring driven program that's taken a lot of cost out, we're obviously going to be in a different phase of the transformation and not have nearly the supply chain reinvention opportunity in a place like Europe. So I think the volume growth will continue to be the big lever point for them. And if we can grow on what is a competitive cost structure, I think you'll see margin expansion in Europe going forward.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. I really appreciate. Thank you, guys.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Well, I think we've reached the end.

(Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay","Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Dave Brearton, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release in today\u2019s slides which are available on our website mondelezinternational.com.","As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","","Thanks Dexter. Good morning. Our second quarter reflected the continued challenges of a difficult macro environment that again tempered category and revenue growth. In fact the operating environment worsened in the quarter in a number of markets especially in Europe. But we continue to expand operating income margins and again delivered strong, high quality EPS growth in the face of these challenges. Adjusted OI margin was 12.6% that\u2019s an increase of a 120 basis points driven by gains in North America and Europe.","These operating gains drove a 19% increase in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. On the top line however we delivered modest organic revenue growth of 1.2%. While that\u2019s below our expectations and below the overall growth of our categories, it reflects our decision to lead pricing to recover cost increases. Our pricing actions were the most significant influence on our revenue growth rate this quarter. As we said in the past our strategy is to increase prices to fully recover the impacts of input costs and currency overtime.","Of course that\u2019s the right thing to do for the long term health of the business and it's critical to driving sustainable profitable growth. Specifically it enables productivity savings to drive gross and operating margins as well as investments in innovation and brand equity.","This year we\u2019re experiencing significant inflation in many of our inputs, notably coco and dairy. This has been magnified by weakening currencies in many emerging markets. In fact nearly half of our input cost increase has been due to currency. This required us to take significant price increases especially in chocolate. Give our share positions in most markets we choose to leave those pricing action and what we anticipated that this would be disruptive in the short term it's been even more challenging than we expected. In a number of key countries and categories our competitors have been slow to implement price increases.","As a result we\u2019re seeing some negative effects on consumer takeaway as well as on our share performance. Of course our competitors faced the same currency related input cost pressures as we do. So while this dynamic has tempered our revenue growth in the short term especially in emerging markets we believe this impact will be temporary. With that as a backdrop growth in our emerging markets although below our expectations was up a relatively solid 4.7%.","In developed markets it's a more complex story, some customers especially in Europe most notably in France have reacted quite severely to our price increases. In fact a member [ph] have refused to accept our pricing which has led to extended disputes and near term distribution losses.","Given our leadership on pricing we\u2019re taking the brunt of these punitive actions. But to be clear this is affecting the broader industry not just us. This issue together with slower category growth in Europe drove a 1.2% organic revenue decline in our developed markets. Let\u2019s look more closely at our Q2 revenue by region.","As expected pricing had a positive contribution in four of our five regions, in Europe revenue was down 1.9%, vol mix declined primarily due to the pricing related disruptions and slower category growth that I just talked about. The regions overall pricing was down modestly as lower coffee prices offset higher pricing in chocolate and cheese.","While lower coffee revenues tempered the region\u2019s growth by 0.4 percentage points we expect coffee will become a tailwind in the second half reflecting the price increases that we began implementing early in Q3. North America increased 2.7% with balance contributions from vol mix and pricing. Biscuits had another strong quarter in part driven by innovations like Oreo Reese's Peanut Butter cups and belVita Soft Baked. Candy also posted solid growth.","EMEA grew more than 6% also with balanced contributions from vol mix and pricing. Russia grew mid-single digits including solid gains in biscuits, candy, and coffee as we continue to invest in our hot zone support. Ukraine revenue was up slightly in the quarter which was a tremendous accomplishment given the current political and economic situation. In Latin America revenue grew nearly 12%, pricing in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina drove much of the increase although it also pressured vol mix.","At the same time Brazil delivered high single digit growth including positive vol mix despite aggressive pricing and increased competitive pressures. Growth was solid across all categories, and finally in Asia-Pacific revenue was down about 8% due to continued weakness in China biscuits and a more intense pricing related retail and competitive environment in Australia and New Zealand. India however delivered another quarter of double digit growth.","As we look at our results by category the same themes are evident, global category growth for the first half was 3.8% above our organic growth of 2%. In biscuits the entire 200 basis point GAAP between category growth and our revenue growth was attributable to China.","We expected a double decline in China biscuits as we cycled last year\u2019s stepped up investments to reinvigorate category growth including the launching of Golden Oreo.","In Chocolate, our decision to lead pricing has resulted in a temporary disruptions and customer disputes in Europe that I described earlier. Additionally in some key markets like Brazil and South Africa our competitors have been slow to increase prices. We believe they will eventually price given the sharp rise in coco including a nearly 20% increase year-to-date and the weakening of emerging market currencies but there is also some positive news in our category results.","In gum we continue to see steady improvement both in the overall category which was up about 1% and in our revenue which declined only low single digits after several quarters of steeper declines.","I\u2019m especially encouraged by our performance in the U.S. where our focus on product assortment and shelf resets, our messaging Oral Care and advantaged innovations like Sour Patch Kids Gum have led to three consecutive quarters of shared growth. We have also continued to deliver strong gum performance in China. In just two years we have captured a 9% share against a strong competitor and we\u2019re on track to deliver a $150 million in revenue this year.","Let\u2019s now take a look at market share, overall year-to-date share performance remained solid with 57% of our revenues gaining or holding share. However as it's expected share softened a bit during the quarter as we priced ahead of competitors. This dislocation was most apparent in our emerging market shares as consumers adjust to the inflation driven price increases. EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific all saw market share performance below 40% on a year-to-date basis.","Looking forward we expect the shares will continue to soften in the near term especially in Q3. Until competitors implement pricing and we resolve the outstanding customer disputes.","So as you can see our revenue growth and share performance was softer than we expected but we believe much of the pricing disruption on revenue and share is temporary and we will revert in the coming months. That said we knew the environment would be challenging and so over the past year we have been rigorously driving productivity, reducing overheads and executing our supply chain reinvention initiatives.","All of these actions have helped to protect our bottom line in 2014 and set the stage for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond.","With that let me turn it over to Dave.","Dave Brearton","","Thanks Irene, and good morning. Over the next few slides I will walk you through our bottom line results and our updated outlook before turning it back to Irene for quick update on some of our strategic and operating initiatives. Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 1.6% for the quarter entirely due to mark to market adjustments but up 0.4% from the first half on a constant currency basis.","Adjusted gross profit margin was down 90 basis points this quarter, again entirely due to mark to market adjustments on hedging contracts. In aggregate we fully price to recover commodity and Forex impacts this quarter in line with our strategy. Although the impact differs by region. Gross margins in North America and Europe were up sharply with aggressively productivity savings driving significant step ups versus prior year. However in AP and EMEA we weren\u2019t able to fully offset higher input cost due to the impact of currency. The full benefit of our pricing actions will be realized over the course of Q3 and Q4 and will set us up well for 2015.","Productivity was again strong in the first half with gross productivity over 4% of cost of goods sold. Net productivity which is our primary measure was about 2.5% of COGS exceeding our expectations.","Adjusted operating income dollars grew nearly 12% for the quarter and nearly 14% in the first half on a constant currency basis. Adjusted OI margin expanded a 120 basis points in the quarter despite the 90 basis point impact from mark to market charges that I previously mentioned.","Margin expansion was high quality, we significantly reduced overheads as a result of our ongoing cost management efforts. In addition we continue to drive efficiencies in advertising and consumer support by consolidating media providers, reducing non-working media cost and shifting spending to lower cost digital media outlets. For the first half, AMC represented about 9% of net revenues in-line with our full year expectations.","So to be clear, we\u2019re not reducing support of our brands or innovation platforms. We\u2019re maintaining our share of voice at least at historical levels especially in the face of our significant pricing.","Taking a closer look at margins, we see that every region posted margin improvement for the first half. The biggest margin and expansion was in our developed markets which as you know is our near term focus. In North America, OI margin was up 310 basis points and Europe increased 200 points. Supply chain and SG&A cost reductions implemented earlier this year drove the improvements.","Turning to EPS, adjusted EPS was $0.40 up 19% on a constant currency basis for the second quarter and was $0.79 up 15% on a constant currency basis for the half. Our first half growth was driven entirely by operating gains despite observing a negative $0.04 impact from mark to market charges. Below the line on favorability and taxes was offset by lower interest expense and share repurchases.","Let me now quickly update you on where we stand on capital allocation and cash flow. We continued to deploy capital to where we expect to deliver the best returns whether it's reinvestment in the business, M&A, reducing debt or returning capital to shareholders. With regard to free cash flow we remain on track to deliver our two year target of $3.7 billion. In fact at the end of Q2 we improved our cash conversion cycle by 2 days driven by DSO and DPO continuing the progress over the last two years.","In the first half we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders, 900 million of which was through share repurchases. For the full year we still expect to return $2 billion to $3 billion to our shareholders including $1 billion to $2 billion in share buybacks. Finally we have paid almost $500 million in dividends year-to-date and today announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share.","Turning to our outlook, we expect our revenue growth rate in the back half to improve modestly as we pass through higher coffee prices and cycle favorable prior year comparisons especially in China. However we now anticipate revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% for the full year. That\u2019s down from our previous outlook of approximately 3% reflecting continued slower category growth and near term dislocations as customers, competitors and consumers adopt and adjust the higher prices.","As we said earlier, we believe the factors pressuring our revenue growth are temporary, category growth rate should improve overtime along with macroeconomic conditions and demographic of snacking trends remain in our favor. Pricing related disputes with our customers are cost of doing business, and all of our competitors face the same challenges from currency related input cost increases.","As Irene mentioned we will continue pricing to recover cost impacts allowing our productivity efforts to fuel the investments and innovation and brand equity that drives sustainable profitable growth.","Turning to 2014 margin and EPS, we continue to expect adjusted OI margin for 2014 in the high 12% range and EPS guidance of a $1.73 to a $1.78 at constant currency. The pricing actions we\u2019re taking along with the supply chain and overhead reduction initiatives we\u2019re driving enable us to maintain our 2014 earnings targets despite a softer top line.","With that let me turn it back to Irene to discuss the strategic and cost reduction initiatives we announced in May.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks Dave. The headline is we\u2019re on track. First we continue to make good progress on taking the steps necessary to successfully close our coffee transaction in 2015. As you know we intend to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create the world\u2019s leading Pure-Play Coffee Company. Both companies have been working closely to prepare for the combination including identifying the key leaders, and having discussions with works councils.","Second, we remain firmly committed to delivery best in class costs in both our supply chain and in overheads. Our supply chain reinvention is on track to deliver $3 billion of gross productivity savings and 1.5 billion of net savings by 2016. We have already begun to see the impact of these efforts in the margin improvement in both Europe and North America.","Our new biscuits facility in Salinas, Mexico is scheduled to open as planned in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re on track to open new facilities next year in the Czech Republic and in India.","As Dave mentioned we\u2019re exceeding our productivity objectives with gross productivity over 4% of cost of goods sold and net productivity at about 2.5% in the first half. With respect to overheads, we\u2019re also advancing our zero base budgeting initiatives. We have identified key areas of improvement in overhead cost assigned accountability for achieving those cost reductions and have already announced several policy changes to begin capturing some non-headcount related savings. We will announce additional changes in the coming month to further drive savings.","Finally we are simplifying and standardizing our ways of working across the company. Last week we named Mark Clouse to a newly created position of Chief Growth Officer to ensure that growth remains at the forefront of our strategy and that we bring the same focus and discipline to driving sustainable profitable growth as we\u2019re doing to improving our cost structure. In this role Mark will be accountable for all of the key drivers of growth by overseeing the team\u2019s responsible for corporate strategy, global categories, marketing, sales and R&D.","This integrated approach will enable us to more efficiently allocate resources to accelerate expansion of global innovation platforms, power brands, and breakthrough technologies. Also last week we announced that we\u2019re adopting a category led model in all of our regions beginning January 1st, 2015.","This region based category led approach is not new to us. Europe has been operating under this model for years, and North America adopted it at the beginning of 2014. So we will leverage the learning from these two regions as we implement this model in our other three.","The new operating model will accelerate growth of our power brands and innovation platforms. Provide greater clarity of roles to drive growth, cost and operating excellence. Deliver standardized processes to reduce costs and improve capabilities and finally ensure that we\u2019re making the right investments in long term technologies.","All of these actions underscore our determination to become a leaner, more focused and more nimble global snacking power house that delivers top tier performance over the long term.","With that let us open for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I had just two questions, if I could, for you, Irene. The first, just in relation to the softer category growth rates, I just want to get a better sense of how much you credit that to the pricing that's going through in this category. Are consumers shifting to other categories, as best you can tell? And I guess related to that, have you seen any stabilization of that market share performance through the quarter? It sounded like it remained pretty soft through the quarter.","Irene Rosenfeld","I would say, actually I think our categories are holding up better than many. So in the world of food one of the reasons we continue to like participating in snacks is that it tends to have a better trajectory in those markets around the world. So yes our categories have softened but I think they are still outperforming many other food categories. With respect to our shares, it's a little bit of mix bag as you look at different countries around the world. Again the biggest issue is whether in fact our price gaps have widened more than we would like them to be and as we start to see those gaps close in various markets around the world we see our share recovering.","So I think that\u2019s what gives us great confidence that what we\u2019re seeing right now is a temporary dislocation. We do think as the pricing gets out there and depending upon reactions out in the marketplace it will take us about another quarter or so to play that through but we would expect that our shares will revert.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And just one quick follow-up-on to that, then would you expect to see any increase in, say, advertising spending or promotional spending to try and ease the progression to higher prices? Is that one of the solutions to the issues you are having some of these markets?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well as Dave said we have been very careful to protect our AMC spending particularly in the challenging pricing environment and we will continue to do so. Any of the changes we have made in AMC have all been in non-working and in consumer oriented activities but our fundamental media spending is exactly where we need it to be to protect our market positions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've got two questions. The first, just to follow up on Chris's question about organic sales growth -- is there anything different with the consumer in emerging markets today that's making it more difficult to raise prices and I guess above and beyond just the price gaps? And I guess my thinking was just, in the past, for Mondelez and really for most companies, a little bit of inflation at a local level is actually pretty good because it allows you to take maybe cost-plus type pricing. So is there just something different this time around that's making it more different in emerging markets to raise prices? And then I have a follow-up.","Irene Rosenfeld","Bryan, I think a little of it just the magnitude. I mean again I talked about the coco being up about 20% and that together with the significant weakening of some of the local currencies has really put a lot of pressure on pricing. And so I think the magnitude is a big part of it but again we\u2019re taking a number of steps aside from making sure that we\u2019re continuing to support our franchise. We\u2019re working very carefully with respect to pricing and sizing to make sure that we\u2019re offering consumers a variety of options at different price points all of which we hope will make this dislocation temporary and allow us to mitigate some of the impacts.","Bryan Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just to follow up on the change into the category-led model, could you just clarify two things? One, does P&L responsibility at the division level change -- so is it still a regional P&L or is it a category P&L? And I guess similar, with Mark Clouse's new position and where he fits in the organization, does he have P&L responsibility?","Irene Rosenfeld","So the P&L will continue to reside at our regional level and within that at the region category level. We really believe for us that is the best balance between capitalizing on local market knowledge and local market execution while at the same time leveraging our scale on a global basis so that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to play this out.","Bryan Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So how does Mark -- does he have P&L responsibility himself?","Irene Rosenfeld","Mark does not have direct P&L responsibility. Our global category teams will continue to steer the overall strategies of our categories out into the marketplace but the P&L will reside closer to the market with our region category leaders and our region presidents.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi","Wanted just to ask a little bit more about pricing volume elasticity and compared to historical price increases. Can you comment on how the current chocolate price in Europe is going versus those historical periods where you've had to do it? And separately, can you comment on maybe the early read on coffee pricing? And if you can tease out the difference between the two -- I have always felt like coffee was a much safer place to take pricing. But I'd like to hear you comment on those two pieces in Europe specifically.","Dave Brearton","In Europe we have obviously faced chocolate pricing in the past. This would be of a magnitude this bigger than what we have done in the past because of the impact of coco going up, actually even the coco butter ratio within that went up, dairy cost went up. So essentially most of the raw materials that go into chocolate went up. And so chocolate has been particularly a hard hit and there has been fairly significant price increases. I would not say the difference this time though is consumer price elasticity. I think difference really is the trade, the trade has pushed back very hard and it reflects the tough environment in Europe and many of the retailers margins themselves are under pressure. So I think the bigger difference this time has been the trade push back and you see that in our shares. Our shares remain quite strong in Europe actually, the shipment is not so strong and that\u2019s really the difference between consumers, so I think are more and less in line with what we expected versus retailers are pushing back much harder.","And as you say it's much more, it goes up and down with markets. I think it will be also a little tougher in the past because of the retail environment but it is an easier thing to get a coffee price increased through than a chocolate one, for sure","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi","One follow-up, on the revenue outlook I think you made the comment that Europe was the single biggest driver of your reduced overall revenue outlook. But it also seems fair to say that emerging markets are also a bit weaker than expected. Do I have the sequence and magnitude correct between the two pieces of why the revenue guidance is a little bit lower?","Dave Brearton","Yes, I mean the emerging markets for the quarter were up 4.7% so less than we would have liked but it's still fairly respectable and as we get into the back half we will continue to have a little bit of a pricing challenges but we\u2019re going to get past that China headwind. So I think emerging markets will still have the pricing challenges but I think you know with the China headwind offsetting that that will be okay. It really is Europe, where we expect to continue to have some retailer pressure and where the pricing really has to flow through completely in the third quarter. So that\u2019s the primary driver.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Two questions from me as well, in the past, have you typically led pricing in all the categories you are implementing pricing today? Or is Mondelez taking a relatively more of a leadership position during this inflation cycle? And, relatedly, are the lags in pricing by competitors atypical this time around?","Dave Brearton","I think we have traditionally led pricing where we have market leadership position and that is the case in most of our category country combination. So we have normally led pricing and we did that this time as well. I can\u2019t speak for the competition, they all have their own unique situations but they are facing the same cost increases. It is typical, that you would have some legs in some countries because they all are looking at through their own lens based on whatever their specific facts and circumstances are. I think this time the impact is a little bit bigger than normal just because of the size of the pricing. So if we price and create a bigger price GAAP that GAAP difference is bigger than it has been in the past because of just of the sheer magnitude of the pricing that\u2019s happening and again it's particularly on chocolate.","David Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And second, you mentioned in your remarks the creation of the Growth Officer position, the need to be nimble and focused and the need for innovation. And all that makes sense. Is there something in terms of your own execution, a particular area that you would want to improve more than others? Perhaps it's the innovation side that you would like to spark. Perhaps it's other marketing. Could you just speak to that? Thanks.","Irene Rosenfeld","You know David I think the single biggest opportunity -- I think there is a number of benefits of the new model I think the single biggest opportunities though will lie in growth and speed and very simply taking good ideas from one part of the world more rapidly to another will be a key enabler I think of accelerating growth. So I am quite optimistic about the ability of this new structure and this new position to be able to allow us to move ideas from one part of the world more rapidly to others.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Katzman at Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Dave, I was wondering last quarter you mentioned how many basis points lower A&P spending helped in terms of margin expansion. Can you give a little more detail about that this quarter year-over-year?","Dave Brearton","Yes I think through the first half as we said we are around 9% of revenue, that\u2019s actually right in-line with what we said we will do on the full year, at the start of the year. The comparison year-over-year is actually impacted by timing last year. The last year we spent about half a point higher than that in the first half and then we spent less than that in the back half. So year-over-year I don\u2019t think there will be a material change but this year it's very smooth, first half, second half. Last year it was much more front weighted and really that comes down to some of the programs we talked about last year led by China. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we\u2019re sustaining the AMC at the right level throughout the year this year and that we\u2019re supporting our brands. I think the key is the share voice hasn\u2019t moved and I think that\u2019s the important metrics that we look at.","Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then how long do you expect these EU disputes to go on?","Dave Brearton","I don\u2019t want to get into predicting negotiations but I think -- the guidance we have given you gives us the flexibility to manage through that and I think it's important that we stick to our principles and we have always priced to recover input cost increases, it's important we stick to that because that\u2019s -- if we don\u2019t do that we don\u2019t have the funding to drive growth for ourselves and our customers. So we will continue to push that through but the guidance we have given you today gives us the flexibility to manage through that.","Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. Last question and I will pass it on. You\u2019ve put in the 10Q about possibly having to change, I guess, how you account for the 49% interest you will have in the coffee JV. Is it possible at this point to run through what the implications of that are to the P&L, maybe not specifically but -- if you don't have that.","Dave Brearton","I can give you in principal what will happen. So when we get to a point where the deal is certain or it closes we will treat it as a discontinued business or a business held for sale depending on the situation next year probably mid-year. At that point we will strip it out as a discontinued operation, the same as we did when we have done other divestures and so all of our history will be restated to take it out. In terms of the go forward it would be handled in an equity method. So we own 49%, we will take 49% to the net income and that would be part of our EPS but it would be recorded below OI. So it would not be within our OI, it would not be within our OI margins. It would be between OI and EPS but it would be part of the EPS. So that\u2019s how it will work starting and closing -- but we think by the first full year of operation which should be 2016 that it should be EPS accretive.","Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So it's still accretive even if it's now kind of a discontinued op? Do you have to lower the earnings base because it's a discontinued op going backward?","Dave Brearton","Yes when I say accretive I mean to where we would have been if we hadn\u2019t done the deal, there is a lots of factors obviously. We lose the OI on coffee when we take it out of the base. We pick up the 49% minority interest and we have got $5 billion of cash coming back which has helped us obviously on the share and the interest side. So that combination of things should be accretive in 2016.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.","John Baumgartner \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Irene, just in China, wondering if you can speak to maybe to your execution there. It seems a few quarters ago you were optimistic that maybe shipping some of the brand spend it back to the secondary biscuit brands could stabilize the market share losses. But it sounds as though maybe it hasn't happened quite yet. So just how would you characterize the fundamentals there, maybe your strategy going forward?","Irene Rosenfeld","Look we\u2019re not pleased with China\u2019s performance I need to be clear but there is actually no new news there. As we told you last year we saw a quite dramatic slowdown in our biscuits category, we lost some share. We have taken a number of actions to try to address both of those issues but the facts are the biscuit category has not yet recovered in fact it's growing only about 1% to 2%. So the reality is that it's still a challenging situation, the good news is as we have said the toughest comps as we enter the second half of the year, the toughest comps will now be behind us so we\u2019re not going to have the same kind of year-over-year headwind that we have had in the first half. And again we\u2019re quite pleased with the performance of gum in China and that continues to be a really strong story for us. But net-net the China situation is essentially as we had shared it with you and we should start to lap those challenges, we starting to lap those challenging comps as we enter the back half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan","Irene, you talked about the grocers rejecting pricing and maybe taking some products off shelf as a cost of doing business. And that's fair, but I guess it doesn't happen that often. So I'm just curious to understand a bit how it took place. Did your marketing team maybe underappreciate some of the customers' will in this case? And I guess more importantly, where does your confidence come from that this will get resolved? You said you expect your competitors to take pricing eventually. But why would they if they just saw what happened to the industry leader?","Irene Rosenfeld","Pricing is always a difficult proposition and we don\u2019t take it lightly particularly in a tough macro environment. What gives us the confidence is that our brands are stronger, traffic drivers for our customers and after a certain point in time it's going to be important to our customers overall growth to have these brands back on the shelf. So we didn\u2019t take those decisions lightly, we made them because it's critical as Dave has said for the long term success and health of our franchise and our ability to continue to invest in them. It was critical to make sure that we\u2019re recovering the cost increases that we\u2019re experiencing.","But we are optimistic given the strength of our brands and the role that they play in driving traffic for our customers that we will be able to successfully resolve this dispute but we\u2019re also allowing in our guidance as Dave said for the fact that it's not necessarily happening tomorrow and we want to acknowledge that.","Dave Brearton","It has historically happened and we did identify at the quarter one call that we expected some disruption. I think so the tactics are actually the same that we have seen in prior times. The difference this time is it's quite brand across many more retailers and it's quite deep. So it is a typical reaction to dealers, SKUs in France or stop shipments or stop buying for a period of time in France. I think it is more dramatic than we anticipated but it's not a completely new tactic.","Ken Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan","One quick one on the U.S. -- at least according to Nielsen data, some traditional snacking categories, all of them, right, cookies, crackers, chocolates, salty snacks, they have all really decelerated. I\u2019m curious if you can talk about what his have been in your view there. We\u2019re seeing some strength in nuts, dried fruit, healthier snack things like that. So just any thoughts you would have on whether there's a share shift within snacking would be helpful. Thank you.","Irene Rosenfeld","Actually our snacking business has performed quite well within as you rightly point out a challenging environment, so there is no question, the categories are slowing. We have been outperforming the categories for quite some time and I think it's for couple of reasons. I think we have had a very strong marketing and innovation pipeline in North America. I think or DSD network is operating extremely effectively. And so we believe that we can continue to drive our growth at or above category rates. Our year-to-date biscuit share is up almost a point and our biscuits organic revenue was up about 4% in the first half and it's because of the factors that I mentioned. So I think there is some slowdown in some of the categories but we have been able to capture a more than our fair share and that\u2019s been driving our overall revenue performance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Just one regional question, I was hoping to get a bit more color on the weaker sales this quarter in Asia. I know you faced an easier prior-year comparison. You have been working through your issues in China for several quarters now and we hopefully are past the worst, but top line did decelerate further, which I'm guessing is attributable mostly to this Australia and New Zealand issue you called out. So is that the case? And if so, can you characterize the impact that's having, what's going on and what we should expect there over the balance of the year?","Irene Rosenfeld","Let me start with the fact that actually through the first half as we said, China was actually massive headwind we were up about 8% year ago in the first half in 2013 in China and so that\u2019s a big headwind to us as we experienced some of the challenges that we said and that continues to be the biggest factor but certainly in the quarter some of what happened in Australia, New Zealand is just a essentially a consequence of some of the same pricing conversations that we have been having about our European customers and again it's something that we think will resolve itself as the year goes on. We did see some fairly significant destocking in some of our Australian customers and that was what caused some of the dislocation in the second quarter.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. But just to be clear, given some of your competitors over the years have had de-stocking issues that have been extremely difficult to resolve in that market, would you say you have an equivalent level of confidence that you would have in Europe going forward as far as getting those products back on shelf and resolving those quickly?","Irene Rosenfeld","These are brands that have very strong market positions, they do drive traffic and quite frankly as we look at some of the inventory positions they are well below healthy level. So, it's reasonable confidence, again we\u2019re not necessarily predicting timing but we do expect that in the guidance that we have given to you we would expect to see that resolve itself in the coming months.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse","Irene, I think it was a year and a half ago at CAGNY that you established some pretty bold targets for points of distribution gains in emerging markets. And since then there has been some SG&A overhead cuts. I wanted to make sure that you are comfortable that you can still achieve those distribution gains, despite the overhead reductions. And have you kept track of those goals? And where do you think you are tracking on them? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Irene Rosenfeld","Absolutely Rob. I mean we\u2019re not cutting our investments in the emerging markets. We have significantly as you know last year we significantly stepped up our investments early in the year, many of that was much of that was in route to market and we are benefiting from those investments. We are continuing to make the necessary investments -- we\u2019re protecting sales to a large extent as we look at some of the overhead initiatives but the end in mind is to make sure that we are making the necessary foundational investments in these key markets to capitalize on the opportunities that will emerge as the economies recover. So we continue to feel good about the investments that we made in route to market, in places like Russia, like Brazil, like India and you will continue to see those investments and making sure that we\u2019re getting an adequate return but this is not about cutting back on those investments. This is again it's the focus is no headcount elsewhere in the world into a large extent as well as some non-people related overhead costs.","Robert Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then the follow-up is you said that your share of voice is still at high levels. But you've shifted a lot of money into digital. And I'm sure your competitors have also. Are you comfortable that your ability to measure share of voice is still good? And are you able to measure digital in share of voice? And then also -- you know, you were in market research. Do you feel comfortable that the return you are getting on digital marketing is sufficient? Or is that still in its infancy in terms of measurement?","Irene Rosenfeld","It's a fair question Rob, I have to tell you, we actually are quite able to measure the ROI of our digital investments and we\u2019re finding it's paying back about twice the rate of our traditional media investments not to mention the fact that we\u2019re seeing quite significant media inflation in a number of our emerging markets and so the benefits of going to digital as that explodes in markets like China and Brazil is a positive because that\u2019s where our consumers are. So I think the evidence that we have is quite compelling and it gives us great confidence that as we continue to shift our spending into digital that we will get actually an even better return on many of those investments","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Company","Can I ask about the leadership changes that we've seen in China and India recently? I think recently you brought somebody in from the outside into China. We've seen some changes recently in India as well. What specifically were you looking for in terms of capabilities? How confident are you that you've got the right people in place now? Just any color that you can give us on that would be great. Thank you.","Irene Rosenfeld","I feel quite good about the leaders that we have placed in both of those countries and in number of our other key emerging markets. As I mentioned India is performing well, continues to grow at a double digit rate and Manu Anand has have a great deal of experience in operating within that country and he has done a great job in continuing to drive the momentum in that market. China we mentioned that we brought in Stephen Maher. He is about four weeks old, I would say in his new role but he has got 16 years of SPG experience most of that -- much of that actually is in China and as a result he brings to t task a very great seasoning in a variety of the disciplines of general management as well as understanding the Chinese market and so I\u2019m quite confident that Stephen will be able to deliver on the ambitious agenda that we have in China.","Alexia Howard \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Company","And then just a quick follow-up, can you give us the run-rate or the current run-rate of gum in China? I think the last time you talked about it, it was about $100 million kind of level. Where are we now?","Irene Rosenfeld","We\u2019re forecasting about 150 for the year, Alexia we\u2019re feeling quite good. We have got about 9% share and we are quite pleased with the performance of our gum business there.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs","There has been a lot of rhetoric about decelerating category growth on the call. You've given us some data in your slides, I guess it's slide 16, suggesting that your category growth, end market growth accelerated from 2.8% in the first quarter to around 3.8% for the full first half, suggesting in the quarter it may actually even have been approaching close to 5%. So is that the right way to think about it? If so, where is the disconnect with the data in the commentary? And also where are you seeing that acceleration from a market perspective?","Dave Brearton","I think the slide we showed for the first half was about 3.8%, you\u2019re right, the first quarter was lower than that but it's basically Easter. So there was a big flip between March and April, huge actually and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the second quarter to be a higher growth rate from the first quarter, the first half in aggregate is the best way to look at it and it's about 3.8%. And when we talk about the category slowdown I think we saw -- in North America we saw that, in a lot of the European markets, we saw it in a lot of the emerging markets as well particularly in the May-June months. So I think we can\u2019t really look at only one quarter given the Easter shift but clearly I think we wanted to make sure that we reflect that in the outlook we give you.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Turning real quick to gum, I imagine you\u2019re not taking much price on gum, just given the cost basket there. Is that fair to say?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes it is.","Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yet in gum you are still lagging the market by a substantial chunk, down low-single digits. The market has turned up around 1% now through the first half. Why shouldn't we be concerned that there is something other than just price gaps and retailer pushback that is driving the market share weakness?","Irene Rosenfeld","I think you need to look at that on a market by market basis Jas, and I talked about the performance in the U.S., we have had three quarters of solid share growth -- I have talked about what\u2019s going in China and our major gum markets were continuing to make good progress behind the initiatives that I have laid out and as I have said we\u2019re still not pleased with our gum performance, it is still negative year-over-year but the good news is that it's less negative and we\u2019re starting to see it moving in a better direction.","Dave Brearton","And I think the two places that are negative, we talked about the positives, Europe is still negative and actually the other one probably surprise you, it's Venezuela because it's an important product and it's a struggle to get the currency. So the Venezuela volume is down quite a bit but those are really the two, they are offsetting a good numbers we\u2019re seeing in China and North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Athlos Research.","Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Athlos Research","Over the course of the quarter, would you say that volume, particularly in developing markets, improved month-to-month? And is that what gives you confidence in the second half that this deceleration won't be sustained? It looks like you're guiding to for the full year in organic net rev, what you have done year-to-date, despite the decel first and second quarter? Or is it more the pricing side, maybe where you have a little bit more control, you know prices are going to be going up, and you know that the second half of the year -- I understand comps get a little bit easier in China. But they get a little bit tougher, particularly on a stacked basis, in the third and fourth quarter other places. So just parsing out those volume versus pricing in your net rev regime? I appreciate it.","Irene Rosenfeld","Jon, again, pricing is the big variable here because you\u2019re correct in saying that we do see that it will pick up some tailwinds in the back half as we lap China and as we cycle the coffee as we see higher prices in coffee. That\u2019s going to be offset as we look at the outlook by the continuous slow category growth as well as the continued dislocation as our pricing makes its way through the system and those are the puts and takes but the big impact offsetting the tailwinds is really the pricing continually to play through and as we have said we would expect even in Q3 that we would expect our share performance will continue to soften as we work our way through some of these customer disputes and more of our pricing impact hits the shelves. We do believe this is temporary but it will have an impact, a continued impact in Q3.","Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Athlos Research","And volume in Asia-Pac and Latin America, did that improve over the course of the quarter or can you say?","Dave Brearton","I think the volume in Asia-PAC is primarily China item, a little bit Australia and then Latin America the volume is really two fold. It's Venezuela and Argentina with the hyperinflation there and that\u2019s been a sort of ongoing trade off on low-margin product as we've priced that away and Mexico to some degree as we adjust to the VAT. I think the important thing in Latin America is Brazil which is really our powerhouse continues to grow vol mix and most of the other countries do as well. So it's kind of Mexico VAT and it's Venezuela\/Argentina which are kind of anomalies.","Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Athlos Research","But can you say whether it improved over the course of the quarter? I'm just talking month to month. Did we leave June on a high note or did we leave just average?","Dave Brearton","We left it where we expect it to be. I mean the China issues was really a question of comparisons to a year ago. It wasn\u2019t so much about improvements this year and I think last year we had a very strong June month so we were down in China year-over-year. I would expect with the absence of those tough comps going into Q3 we are pretty comfortable with the run-rate in China, is where it needs to be that the numbers we gave you today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow \u2013 Bank of Montreal","Just talking more about the things that you could do in your control, I know as you go through ZBB, a lot of times as I think through the process companies tend to find a greater deal of cost savings through this process. Can you talk about have you seen a greater opportunities than you initially thought? And at what point do you think there's a potential for an acceleration of even greater savings, because it seems like you guys have done, actually a pretty good job on this front?","Irene Rosenfeld","Ken, I would say we have set some fairly aggressive targets. We have laid out our targets of approximately 300 to 400 basis points over the next three years and that\u2019s a fairly aggressive agenda. The good news is I would tell you as we continue to work our way through the specific initiatives I have great confidence that we will deliver those targets but I think the we just need to continue to make progress quarter-after-quarter. I\u2019m pleased as I said in the programs and the impact it has had in just even in our Q2 results and I think we still continue to see that play through.","Ken Zaslow \u2013 Bank of Montreal","And just a follow-up, I know in parts of the business, are you actually adding infrastructure? I know you\u2019re adding a Growth Officer. Is there other levels that are somewhat being funded by this whole cost savings opportunity? Or was that always part of the plan of having maybe not another layer of management but another layer of infrastructure?","Irene Rosenfeld","Simple answer is no, we\u2019re not adding a layer of infrastructure and in fact there is some puts and takes that go with the creation of the Chief Growth Officer role. But it is a fact that as we look at our opportunity within the context of the new operating model we\u2019re continuing to invest in sales and route to market and so we\u2019re taking disproportionately, we\u2019re taking some of our savings disproportionately from some of the other areas into the operation in favor of those key front line investments. So you will see that slide through but we\u2019re not creating another layer in with the creation of the Chief Growth Officer.","Operator","Your final question comes from David Hayes of Nomura.","David Hayes \u2013 Nomura","Two questions, if I can, first a broad one and then a specific one on Europe. Just in terms of the broader question, obviously you've got some moving parts in terms of the disappointment in terms of sales growth through the year. But is there any anxiety at all internally that there's too much demand on the cost saving side, the margin delivery side in the organization and that is what is basically defocusing the business from performing as well as maybe it could do more has done in terms of sales and market share delivery?","And then the second question just going back to the EU, two things on this. Firstly, you mentioned France and then Europe interchangeably. Just to understand, is it just France that these issues are existing in terms of the retailers or where there are other markets as well? And then just in terms of the dynamic, you made the point yourself that the consumer off take is still good, that the shipments effectively are lagging now because of negotiations. To some extent you would have thought, with your brands being mass stock in many cases, to your point earlier, that you would just catch up the shipments and therefore the second half would bounce.","So the question to some extent is that the dynamic? And is your guidance for the second half therefore very cautious in your view? And actually you could be better than the 2% \u2013 2.5% as that dynamic plays out? Thank you.","Irene Rosenfeld","Let me answer your last two questions and then I will come back to the first. It is about France and should the shipments catch up? The simple answer is, we hope so. But the speed with which we resolved some of these disputes is kind of not something that I wanted to predict. So we believe in the guidance we have given to you, we have adequately reflected the reality that someday we will get ourselves through these conversations but we\u2019re not counting it necessarily happening tomorrow and so I hope that gives you some perspective on that question. With respect to the question of is there too much focus on margin and to what extent is that putting creating more pressure on our top line, there is question. We\u2019re doing a lot right now but I really do believe that it's much better to move quickly and decisively rather than leaving a lot of uncertainty out in the organization. We\u2019re certainly -- experiencing some disruption but our focus is to protect the long term health of our business and our ability to invest in our franchise and in our people.","And so again we believe that the dislocation that we\u2019re experiencing is temporary, we will work our way through it but most importantly we believe we\u2019re doing the right things for the long term health of the business and as I mentioned our strategic initiatives are moving along on track consistent with what we had expected.","Operator","This does conclude our question and answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Congbalay for any closing remarks.","Dexter Congbalay","Any follow-up questions Nick and I will be around for the rest of the day and we will be happy to take any callers or emails that you might have.

[Operator instructions.]  I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, vice president, investor relations, for Mondelez International.  Please go ahead sir.  ","Dexter Congbalay","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us.  We\u2019re making are Irene Rosenfeld, our chairman and CEO, and Dave Brearton, our CFO.  Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release.  This release, and today\u2019s slides are available on our website, www.mondelezinternational.com.  ","As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks, Dexter.  Good afternoon.  As you know, 2012 was a transformational year for our company.  During the first nine months, we intensely prepared for the spinoff of our North American grocery business.  The separation into two world-class companies was a massive undertaking, culminating in the successful launch of both Mondelez International and Kraft Foods Group on October 1, and a significant increase in shareholder value.","We executed the spin will delivering solid results on both the top and bottom lines.  For the full year, organic revenue increased 4.4%.  That\u2019s lower than our long term target, reflecting second half coffee price declines and the temporary issues we discussed in the third quarter.","And, as expected, fourth quarter trends improved significantly, setting us up to deliver 2013 revenue growth in line with our guidance.  We also staged 2013 on the bottom line, delivering high-quality earnings growth and solid margin expansion.  ","Specifically, we fully recovered higher input costs for pricing, we significantly increased the contribution of volume mix, and we delivered strong productivity.  As a result, we expanded gross margin by 70 basis points.  This provided the fuel for substantial increase in advertising and consumer support to drive strong growth in our power brands and to take advantage of white space opportunities.  ","We held overhead flat on a constant currency basis, despite significant investments in sales.  And even with these investments in A&C and sales, we increased adjusted operating income by more than 7% on a constant currency basis, and expanded our adjusted operating income margin by 70 basis points.  That\u2019s the virtuous cycle at work: focusing on our power brands and core categories to drive the top line, expanding gross margins, leveraging overheads, and reinvesting savings to drive future growth.  ","Turning to the fourth quarter, organic revenue increased 3.7%.  Revenue growth, while below our long term target, was largely in line with our expectations, with strong volume mix supported by sequential improvements in Brazil and Russia.  This was partially offset by lower coffee pricing, which tempered growth by more than half a percentage point.  Developing markets grew 7.6%, which is in line with the high single digit guidance we provided three months ago.","In Europe, our team delivered another quarter of strong volume mix gains, despite a challenging economic environment.  And in North America, the benefit of our focused, direct store delivery sales force drove another strong quarter of growth in our U.S. biscuit business.","Power brands continue to drive our top line, and were up nearly twice the rate of the company\u2019s overall growth.  In fact, power brands were up 8% for the year.  Specifically with the exception of gum and candy, our power brands are growing at rates that are at or above our long term growth targets.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the performance of each of our core categories.  Biscuits revenue grew 7%.  The U.S. and Europe were both up mid-single digits, driven by strong innovation and a focus behind power brands.  In developing markets, biscuits increased double digits, led by China and Russia.","Our biscuits power brands were up 12%, fueled by Oreo, Velveeta and Barney.  Oreo, which crossed the $2 bill revenue mark last year increased mid teens including growth of more than 20% in developing markets.","Velveeta, which anchors our sustaining energy platform, grew more than 50%.  In fact, Velveeta generated over $400 million in revenue last year as we expanded the platform across Europe and introduced it to new markets such as North America and Australia.","Barney, which leads our kids wholesome platform, increased more than 20% as it expanded across eastern and western Europe.  Overall, Barney generated nearly $200 million in revenue last year.","We're especially proud of our share performance.  In 2012, 80% of our biscuit revenue gained or held share.  That's a real testament to the strength of our brand to our strong sales and marketing efforts around the globe.","In chocolate, our revenue increased 5%.  In developed markets, chocolate was up low-single digits led by strong volume mix growth in Europe.  The gains were driven by innovation platforms such as snacks, small bites and bubbly (air rated) chocolate as well as creative programming around the ones in Olympics.","In developing markets, chocolate was up high-single digits with strength in EMEA and Brazil as well as in smaller markets such as South Africa, Argentina and Poland.  Australia also posted solid growth driven by double digit gains of Cadbury Dairy Milk fueled by successful innovations such as marvelous creations.","Our chocolate Power Brands grew 10% led by Cadbury Dairy Milk and Lacta, which were each up low to mid teens.  Milka also posted strong growth increasing high single digits.","Despite strong performances in biscuits and chocolate, results in gum and candy were disappointing.  Revenue was down 2% mostly due to gum.  In developed markets, gum was down high-single digits although the rate of decline slowed in the fourth quarter.","In developing markets, gum performance was mixed.  Brazil and Japan declined, as we discussed in the third quarter, but this was more than offset by strength in several other markets such as Argentina, South Africa and Egypt.","Growth was also supported by the successful launch of gum in China last summer.  Frankly, I'm disappointed that gum remains a challenge.  As we've said before, we attribute roughly 60% of the issue to category declines with about 40% due to share losses.","The share losses are clearly fixable.  We've already implemented a number of tactical sales and marketing initiatives as well as launched some strong innovation.  We're beginning to get some traction and we're confident that these efforts will improve our share in the near term.","But the category declines will take longer to fix.  We continue to expect the turnaround in gum to take a couple of years before we begin to see a return to the mid-single digit growth.  While that's a slower recovery than we\u2019d like, let me put our gum business in perspective.  ","At only 9% of our total revenue, we do not need an immediate turnaround in gum to achieve our 2013 revenue guidance or our long term targets.  In contrast to gum, candy, excluding some product pruning in Canada, grew low single digits in 2012, with growth in the U.S. and developing markets.  This momentum, together with our share rebound in gum, should help stabilize total category performance in the near term.","Finally, in the beverages and cheese and grocery categories, revenue rose 5%, driven by power brand growth of 6%.  Coffee was up low single digits, with solid gains in volume mix led by our on-demand Tassimo platform.  Coffee pricing, however, was a significant headwind in the back half of the year as we reflected lower green costs.  ","In powdered beverages, Tang, our newest billion-dollar brand, continued to grow strongly, up low teens.  So in sum, we delivered solid revenue growth in 2012, laying the groundwork for a strong 2013.","Q4 revenue rebounded from a soft Q3, with significant improvements in both Brazil and Russia, and we expanded both gross and operating income margins while significantly stepping up investments.","As we enter 2013, we remain laser-focused on driving our power brands, our global snacking platforms, and our strong routes to market to deliver on the exciting progress of our new growth company.","Let me now turn it over to Dave to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results in more detail.  ","David Brearton","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon.  As Irene mentioned, we delivered solid top line growth for the year, up 4.4%.  Q4 grew 3.7%.  While below our long term target, this was largely in line with our expectation of mid single digit growth.  Power brands continued to drive our top line, up 7% in the quarter and 8% on the full year.  ","For the year, adjusted operating income increased more than 7% on a constant currency basis.  Higher gross profit fueled the growth, and were partially offset by a high single-digits increase in A&C, largely in support of our power brands.  ","For the year, A&C as a percentage of net revenue increased 60 basis points to 9.4%.  Even with this sharp increase in A&C, we boosted adjusted OI margins by 70 basis points to 12.2%.  For the year, operating EPS was $1.39, up about 5% on a constant currency basis.  The increase was driven by a strong $0.16 improvement in operating earnings.  This were partially offset by an increase in the tax rate from an unusually low base in 2011 as well as a number of one-time items.","For the quarter, operating EPS was $0.36.  That\u2019s down about 5% on a constant currency basis.  Similar to the full year results, the quarter included strong operating earnings growth of about 10%.  But this was more than offset by a tax rate increase from the low 2011 base, as well as a number of one-time items incurred in 2012 or the prior year.","Let\u2019s now take a look at each region\u2019s performance.  In developing markets, revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 7.6% in Q4.  As Irene mentioned, that\u2019s in line with our recent guidance of high single-digits for the quarter.  Vol mix was strong, contributing 4.4 points of growth, which was the best quarter of the year.  Pricing added 3.2 points, but its contribution was tempered by lower coffee pricing in Central and Eastern Europe.  ","The sequential rebound in growth also translated into better share performance, with more than half of our developing markets revenue gaining or holding share in the quarter.  Power brands once again drove growth across these markets, up 13% in the fourth quarter and 12% for the full year.","There were several star performers in 2012.  Velveeta, Barney, Chips Ahoy, Oreo, Eclairs, and Stride each increased more than 20%, while Cadbury Dairy Milk and Lacta grew mid to high teens.","Let's take a closer look at each of the developing market sub regions.","In Latin America, organic revenue was up high-single digits and we closed the year on a high note with revenue up low double digits in the fourth quarter.","Brazil rebounded in Q4 to mid-single digit growth.  Gum remains a challenge as category dynamics remain week and we cycle difficult comparisons from a year ago.  But we have terrific performances in chocolate, biscuits and powder beverages led by Lacta, (inaudible) and (Tank).","We also continue to expand distribution in the fast growing north, northeast region where we grew mid teens.","In Asia Pacific, full-year revenue increased high-single digits.  Revenue was up low double digits in the fourth quarter as China and India continued to post strong growth.","Our business in China cross the $1 billion threshold in 2012 with growth of 25% for the year.  Biscuits grew more than 20% behind continued strength in Oreo.","Gum and candy increased more than 60%.  This reflects the strong growth of Cadbury Eclairs and the successful launch of Stride gum, which has exceeded expectations since its introduction in the third quarter.","Our business in India was up about 20% for both the full year and the fourth quarter.  As we've told you before, we are experiencing capacity constraints in India.  These will continue until new production lines come onstream in the middle of the year, so growth rates in 2013 are likely to be lower initially and build as the year progresses.","In Central and Eastern Europe, organic revenue was essentially flat for Q4 and for the year.  In the fourth quarter, all mix was strong but it was largely offset by lower pricing.","In Russian, revenue trends improved significantly.  In the fourth quarter, revenue declined modestly as lower pricing in coffee and chocolate more than offset all mix gains of about 4%.","Biscuits were especially strong, up mid teens in the quarter behind category growth and successful innovation.","In the Middle East and Africa, revenue increased low double digits for the year and mid single digits for the fourth quarter.  The full year growth rate reflects strong performance in the Gulf region, South Africa and Egypt.","Looking ahead, we're especially excited about our new joint venture in the Gulf region announced last month.  The transition to the new JV structure will temper our top line growth in Q1 but beginning April 1st we'll see a step up in revenues and higher profits.","Turning to profit, 2012 adjusted segment operating income increased 5.2% on a constant currency basis.  We grew gross profit by recovering higher input costs for pricing and posting all mix gains.","This fueled a double digit increase in A&C support and significant investments in sales capabilities.  Adjusted OI margin was essentially flat for the year as overhead leverage generally offset the increase in A&C support.","Moving to Europe, we continued to deliver solid results in a difficult economic environment.  In fact, this is the 12th consecutive quarter of organic top line growth.","Organic revenue increased modestly in the fourth quarter as strong all mix was mostly offset by lower coffee breakthrough.  For the year, growth was 2.3%, fueled by gains in all mix.  In fact, the consistency of our fall mix gains in Europe is one of the highlights for the 2012 performance.","This strength also manifested itself through impressive share performance.  In 2012, more than two-thirds of our European revenue gained or held share, a level we sustained throughout the year.  Our European Power Brands were up 3% for the quarter and 5% for the year.","Let's take a closer look at performance in European task orders.  Biscuits had a strong year, up mid single digits led by continued strength in Velveeta, Oreo and our chocolate bakery platform.","Our $1 billion (Lou) brand also posted solid growth in France.  In addition, biscuits captured higher market share in Europe with notable gains in France, the UK and Germany.","Chocolate and coffee also posted strong results for the year, each up low to mid single digits.  In chocolate, innovation and strong marketing campaigns behind our Power Brands fueled that growth including mid single digit increases for both Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka.  Last year, we gained or held share in 15 of 17 countries in which we compete, including key markets such as the U.K. and Germany.","In coffee, the growth story was drastically different in the front and back halves of the year.  Strong price-driven growth in the first half reversed itself in the second half, with coffee prices declining with strong vol mix gains.","As we discussed on our last call, we expected coffee revenue growth to be modest in the fourth quarter, due to lower coffee prices, and we expect coffee prices to continue to be a headwind in the first half of 2013, until we cycle the price declines beginning in Q3.","Our on-demand coffee platforms continue to deliver excellent growth.  Tassimo was up more than 20% for the year, and more than 40% in Q4, behind a significant increase in marketing support.  Our new Millicano whole bean instant platform has generated $14 million in revenue, as well as high incremental sales with strong repeat rates.   ","In contrast, gum and candy declined high single digits in 2012, with gum down sharply.  Trends improved somewhat in the fourth quarter, with the introduction of 40 Minutes in France and Spain and Twist in Greece and Portugal.  ","The category remains challenging due to economic weakness in our key markets as well as aggressive promotional activity by competitors.  But, at less than 8% of our European revenue, gum and candy\u2019s impact on Europe\u2019s total growth is modest.  We remain very pleased with our performance in biscuits, chocolate, and coffee.  ","Turning to profits, full year adjusted OI increased 5.2% on a constant currency basis last year.  Pricing, strong productivity, and volume mix gains drove the improvement.  In addition, absolute overhead spending declined mid-single digits on a constant currency basis, fueling a double digit increase in A&C.","Adjusted OI growth, however, was tempered somewhat by the negative impact of prior year accounting accounting calendar changes, which more than offset the reversal of an accrual related to the Cadbury acquisition.  Adjusted segment OI margin expanded 90 basis points to 13.2%.  Higher gross margin and overhead leverage drove the improvement, which was partially offset by the increase in A&C.  ","Turning to North America, biscuits grew mid-single digits in the U.S., driving top line performance in Q4 and for the full year.  As we discussed last quarter, we are seeing the benefits of a DSD sales force focused solely on biscuits.  These benefits include more feature and display opportunities, additional facings for new products, and an increase in total distribution points.","Momentum picked up in the fourth quarter.  Our biscuit power brands increased high single-digits, and Velveeta continued a strong performance.  We captured 60 basis points of market share across total biscuits in the quarter, in part due to better in-store merchandising.","Gum and candy in the U.S. was flat for the year.  However, it improved slightly for the second consecutive quarter.  In Q4, gum was down low single digits, as declines in [Base], Stride, and Dentyne offset mid single digit growth in Trident and the successful launch of ID.","In candy, Halls increased mid single digits due to innovation and the more severe cold and flu season.  Other candy brands were up nearly 10% due to expanded distribution.  Canada declined high single-digits in the quarter due to the transition after the spinoff of the North American grocery business.","So what happened?  Our Canadian operations in the former Kraft Foods North America structure were highly integrated from a sales, systems, and distribution standpoint.  The full separation on October 1 resulted in some temporary sales disruption in the quarter, but we\u2019re confident that the Canadian business will be back on track in Q1.  ","Despite minimal contribution from gum and candy in Canada, we delivered solid organic revenue growth in North America, driven by our power brands, which were up 6% in the quarter and the year.  There were several star performers.  Honey Maid and Triscuit each grew double digits last year.  Velveeta performed exceptionally well in its first year, generating more than $60 million in revenue.  And nearly all the other biscuit power brands posted solid mid single digit growth, including our largest brand, Oreo.","Turning to profit, adjusted segment operating income increased 5.1% on a constant currency basis.  Adjusted segment OI margin expanded 50 basis points to 14.8%.  Similar to our performance in developing markets and Europe, the increase was driven by higher gross margin as we successfully priced away higher input costs and drove strong productivity partially offset by an increase in A&C.","Now, let's turn to our outlook.  Fundamentally, the factors underlying our previous guidance are unchanged.  We continue to expect to deliver organic net revenue growth at the low end of our long-term target 5% to 7%.","This is due to three things: lower coffee prices in the first half of the year, the challenging economic environment, and the need to build incremental capacity to support our developing market growth.","While we don't expect the global economy to improve anytime soon, the other two factors, coffee pricing and capacity constraints, are really first half challenges.  As a result, we expect our growth to be more modest in the first half as we gain steam in the back half of the year.","On the bottom line, we're updating our 2013 guidance due to a couple of currency impacts.  First, our outlook now reflects average full-year 2012 foreign currency rates.  These are about $0.06 favorable versus the rates we used last September.  We've provided some of the key 2012 rates in the appendix to this presentation.","And second, we've included the expected impact of the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar.  We have a large and successful business in Venezuela.  The 32% devaluation will negatively impact our full year by about $0.04.  Therefore, we\u2019re raising our operating EPS guidance to a range of $1.52 to $1.57, up from our previous range of $1.50 to $1.55.","Again, this change is due entirely to currency.  Each quarter, we\u2019ll provide you with an update on the potential currency impact to our outlook, based on recent spot rates.  As an example, using January 1 rates, our guidance would increase by another $0.02.","Our earnings guidance reflects double digit operating EPS on a constant currency basis, which is consistent with our long term growth targets.  We expect to drive this strong increase in EPS by delivering high single-digit operating income growth on a constant currency basis, again consistent with our long term targets.","We\u2019ll deliver this operating income with stepped-up investments behind our power brands and other initiatives to drive growth, including enhancing our sales capabilities, broadening our distribution, expanding our innovation platforms globally, and launching our categories into new markets.","Below the line, we expect a tax rate in the low 20s.  That\u2019s lower than our long term projection of mid-20s, but in line with 2012 tax rates.","In summary, our guidance on both the top and bottom line is in line with the outlook we provided last September.  Our top line growth will be more modest in the first half, and accelerate as the year progresses.  And our bottom line results will continue to be high quality, driven by strong margin gains and sustained by continued investments in our brands.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Irene for some concluding remarks.  ","Irene Rosenfeld ","Thanks, Dave.  As I said at the start of this call, 2012 was truly a transformational year for our company, and I\u2019m excited to continue on our journey as a more focused growth company.  As we enter 2013, we have all the ingredients in place for sustainable, profitable growth: a diversified geographic footprint with a significant presence in emerging markets, a focus on faster growing snacks categories, an unrivaled portfolio of beloved power brands and advantaged innovation platforms, and strong momentum from high-quality operating results.","With that wind in our sails, we remain very bullish about the future of our business.  Now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.  ","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","There\u2019s been a heightened amount of focus, I guess, going into this quarter just about how you\u2019d perform relative to expectations.  So can you just talk a little bit about, as the quarter unfolded, just what came in line, what was in line or better than expectations and maybe kind of how things mapped out relative to what your original expectations were.","Irene Rosenfeld ","Most importantly, we delivered growth that was essentially in line with our mid-single digits guidance.  It represented a significant sequential improvement as we had said, in Brazil and Russia.  We\u2019re quite happy with the quality of the results in each region.  We saw solid contributions and significant step ups in the volume mix contribution.  Very strong share performances, as Dave mentioned, around the world, and strong growth in our power brands.  So net-net, we feel quite good about the overall performance of the quarter.","Frankly, the top line was a little lighter than we had expected.  We were expecting a growth rate to have a four in front of it.  And as we said, the shortfall was largely attributed to the transition issues that we experienced in Canada as we separated what was the most integrated business in our company. ","But we feel very good about the quality of our revenue growth.  We continue to make the necessary investments in A&C and sales, which will fuel the growth in 2013 and beyond.  We feel very good about the overall momentum of the business, and so we\u2019re quite confident that we\u2019ll deliver our 2013 guidance on both the top and bottom lines.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","If I could follow up, Dave, on SG&A in the quarter.  It came in higher than what we were modeling.  So I was just trying to get a sense for, did you end up with higher A&C spending than you originally thought in the quarter?  And also, are there other moving parts especially related to the transition that affected SG&A?  ","David Brearton","We came in pretty much where we expected.  Probably a bit higher than you modeled, because of a couple of things.  Number one, in the fourth quarter we ended up, at the date of the spin, we had to revalue our pensions.  So we actually took about a $0.02 hit on pension costs in the fourth quarter than we were expecting, but you probably wouldn\u2019t have anticipated.  We also had the synergies kicking in in the fourth quarter.  So that was when they really started, and we had said last year that we expected the synergies to be about $235 million for 2013.  One quarter of that hit quarter four.  So those are probably the two numbers that might not have been in your model.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.  ","Andrew Lazar - Barclays"," ","Just two things from me.  I guess first would be you gave a number of reasons for why the organic top line growth would be somewhat tempered in the first half of \u201913.  I was hoping you could help us a little bit with maybe the magnitude of that, or helping us to quantify it.  And the reason I\u2019m going down this road is things are going to have to accelerate as you talked about, in the back half, to get to five for the year.  And I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how much of an acceleration in the back half you\u2019re going to need to get to five to make it seem like that\u2019s a reasonable expectation for us to have.  ","David Brearton","I don\u2019t want to get into the habit of giving quarterly guidance, but we\u2019ve guided you to the low end of the five to seven range.  Clearly given coffee and some of the capacity constraints, you would expect us to be below that in the first half.  So we will be below the low end of five to seven in the first half, which means we\u2019re going to need to be higher than that in the back half.  ","And in terms of should you be concerned about the kind of turnaround that requires, no, I don\u2019t think so.  Because if you actually look at our results this year, we were up around 6% in the first half of the year.  So I think we\u2019ve demonstrated we can grow at the kind of levels we\u2019ll have to grow in the back half of the year.  We just need to get through the coffee pricing headwinds and the capacity constraints in front of us right now.  ","Andrew Lazar - Barclays"," ","And then in Europe, that was one area where I think you had said on the last call organic top line would be up at a low to mid single digit pace.  And it was flattish in the quarter, and you talked about how the volume mix piece was something that you were pretty happy about.  So was it that coffee pricing was down more severely than you thought, or volume didn\u2019t rebound quite as strongly as you had hoped, as you lapped some of that pricing?  Trying to get a sense, because that seemed to be the one area where the organic top line differed most clearly from what you had said last quarter.  ","Irene Rosenfeld ","Let me just give you a perspective on that, because the reality is the results in developing markets in Europe were pretty much where we thought.  The number that you\u2019re quoting we said was, North America and Europe, we said would be low single digits.  If you look at the individual regions, our developing markets delivered essentially in line with the high single digit guidance we had given.  As I said, they were up 7.6%.  ","Europe delivered essentially in line with our expectation of modest growth.  We grew about 0.5, 0.7 in third quarter, and we were essentially flat in this quarter on the top line, consistent with the expectations associated with the coffee price decline.   ","The real issue and again, the variance versus our expectations, was in North America.  We had expected that growth to accelerate from Q3 into Q4, given the strength that we were seeing, particularly on our biscuit business, but the impact of the Canadian transition tempered that growth somewhat, and that\u2019s what led us to be a little bit below what we had expected.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays"," ","And one quick one, when you gave the 5% to 7% organic long term top line growth rate guidance, that I understand is obviously inclusive of everything, and that would be even the vagaries of coffee prices being up or down depending on what\u2019s going on with green coffee costs.  I\u2019m trying to make sure, should we expect more volatility maybe to that 5-7% than maybe I\u2019m thinking about, in the way you think about the algorithm based on coffee?  Or is it just that there are a number of other things going on that you\u2019ve talked about, whether it be the challenges broadly in Europe, or in gum, or what have you, that have just made getting to 5% difficult even including these changes in coffee prices?","Irene Rosenfeld ","First of all, our long term guidance is 5-7% inclusive.  We feel quite comfortable that over time coffee pricing will not be a major factor.  As you know, the volatility over this last year, we went from Arabica at about $2.40 a pound all the way down to trending about $1.40 today.  So the volatility that we saw was really quite unusual, and really had a profound impact on the first half very strong the second half, which is why it leads to the trends that Dave described.  But net-net, we feel quite comfortable that as we get beyond the spin, we get all of the pieces of the enterprise moving properly, we are quite confident that we will be able to deliver 5-7% growth on a consistent basis over the long term.   ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll - Citi","Wanted to ask just two questions related to input cost expectations in 2013.  The first one would relate specifically to chocolate.  Dave, can you talk about the input cost environment for the chocolate business?  Should we expect reasonably significant deflation as one of the big positives, kind of the wind at the sails at the back of that particular operation?  That\u2019s the first question.","Second question relates to coffee on commodity inputs for 2013.  Some businesses in coffee are pass-through, and really you just don\u2019t get the benefit.  You guys have described a lot about the top line impacts.  I care probably more about the profit impact.  I think the Tassimo operation may in fact be much stickier in terms of holding price points while seeing green coffee costs come down, but maybe you can talk us through that a little bit. ","David Brearton","I\u2019ll start with the chocolate.  I think chocolate\u2019s like most of our products.  There is no individual commodity that is a significant portion of the cost.  And we tend to look at the total input cost bucket, which includes cocoa, obviously, and sugar, and various other ingredients.  It also is impacted by currency rates, because cocoa is denominated in British pounds for us.  Packaging, energy, labor costs, etc. The sort of amalgamation of all of those things we do not see a cost decline in any of our major businesses next year.  ","We would probably say across the company we\u2019d be in the low single digit inflation across all of those components.  And our strategy has been, and continues to be, we\u2019ll price to recover those input costs.  And we\u2019ll leverage our aggressive productivity programs to grow our gross margin.  So that\u2019s kind of implicit in the whole cycle, and chocolate will be no different.  ","In terms of coffee, you\u2019re right that a good portion of the coffee business is the roast and ground coffee business, which is a bit of a pass-through category.  And we would expect to cover the price increases when costs go up, and we did last year and the year before, and to return a lot of that to the marketplace when costs go down.  And again, assuming that has to cover forex and all the other items, that is also likely to be true over time.  ","But it\u2019s not going to be abrupt, and I think you should look at coffee really no different than the other categories.  The on-demand stuff you\u2019re talking about, Tassimo, soluble coffee, etc., that we talk about, it is growing at a higher percentage for our business, and clearly coffee is a lower percentage of those costs than it is on roast and grounds.  So you\u2019ll see less dramatic swings over time.  But again, that will be in the pricing line.  On the OI line, we price to recover costs, and the opportunity to make huge money on the way up or down really isn\u2019t there in most of that business.  We really view it as managing our margins as part of the overall strategy.  ","Irene Rosenfeld ","Two additional perspectives on that.  One is that we are quite confident, as I said a few minutes ago, that we can manage our way through some of these issues over time, and as we made the commitment to 5% revenue growth, we\u2019re quite confident that we can deliver that.  ","But I\u2019d also say, even coffee, you can\u2019t look at the revenue per se as the only measure of how healthy that franchise is.  In fact, our coffee revenue was essentially flat in the fourth quarter, despite the fact that we had a 7-point headwind in pricing.  ","So very strong vol mix performance, as Dave mentioned, as we continue to improve the vol mix with focus on our on-demand offerings that will continue to strengthen.  But as you look at coffee, you need to get underneath the actual revenue a little bit to get a better sense of the health of the franchise.   ","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.  ","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","I know you don\u2019t want to give specific guidance on any quarter, but given the unpredictability of the organic top line rate the last couple of quarters, is there any kind of range you can think about, or help us think about, for the first quarter?  It\u2019s just such an issue for the stock right now, I\u2019d say.  ","David Brearton","Again, I don\u2019t want to get into quarterly guidance.  We gave some last quarter, really because it was our first quarter out of the gate, and we were trying to get people used to it.  I really don\u2019t want to go beyond what I said to Andrew earlier.  It will be below that low end of 5-7 in Q1 to Q2.  And I think we\u2019re going to have many of the same factors impacting us that impacted us in Q4.  But I can\u2019t go beyond that.  ","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Okay.  And then forgive the bluntness of this question in advance, please, but your organic growth has now fallen short of Street expectations for two consecutive quarters, and these are the only two quarters you\u2019ve had.  The stock has been invested in, for many investors, because of that top line potential.  So just saying \u201cWe are quite confident that we can deliver on our 5% plus next year,\u201d I hope you can understand that may not be enough for some people.  I know you\u2019ve provided some, but any specifics you can provide besides just saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve done it before\u201d that can help people gain confidence that you will get back to that number.  Because right now, there\u2019s a lack of confidence that you guys will get to that 5% number, right or wrong.   ","Irene Rosenfeld ","The one thing I\u2019d say, Ken, in response to your issue, 2012 was a transformational year for our company.  We split a $54 billion enterprise.  We created significant shareholder value in that process, while still delivering solid full year results.  And very high quality full year results.  ","And we\u2019ve talked quite a bit about that.  The top line rebounded in the fourth quarter as we said it would.  The revenue growth was very much in line with the guidance, the mid single digit guidance that we gave you.  We delivered high-quality results as we\u2019ve discussed, in each of our regions.  We\u2019ve got very strong underlying performance of our power brands, very strong continued expansion of gross margins and operating margins.  We\u2019ve continued to make the necessary investments in our franchises, both in A&C as well as sales and distribution.  And we delivered very solid income growth on a constant currency operating basis.  ","And so you put all of that together, this enterprise is performing quite well.  It\u2019s not quite up to the long term targets.  We understand that.  But we have all the makings underneath.  A very solid franchise, and the opportunity to deliver, as we said we would, on our 2013 guidance.","David Brearton","And I think the other thing is the reason to believe we can do it over time, is our categories are growing in that range.  I think as we said when we had the investor day in September, the categories we\u2019re participating in are growing that 5-7% range.  So we do have some stuff we have to get out of the way in the short term, but I think directionally, it is essentially saying we\u2019ll grow in line with some pretty high-growth categories.  And that will deliver the results that we put out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","I have two questions.  One is, can you give us an update on Australia and Japan?  I know those were somewhat weak, and I know that you said you corrected a lot of the issues last quarter.  I just kind of want to follow up on Australia and Japan.  ","David Brearton","Australia had a good bounce back.  I think they were up in sort of mid-single digits in the quarter, and really had some strong marketing campaigns and some good new products there, particularly in the chocolate business.  Japan is gum.  So the discussion we had on gum earlier, you can apply all of that to Japan.  They continued to decline in the quarter.  ","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","And my follow up is, what type of progress should we be looking for to see how you\u2019re\u2026 I know with the gum side, you said look, it will take two years.  I get that.  But what type of milestones of progress that we should be looking at to see the progress you\u2019re making to see that\u2019s actually turning around in that [unintelligible] period.  I know it\u2019s going to take longer.  But could you give us milestones that we should be thinking about?  ","Irene Rosenfeld ","I think the key milestone to look at is our share.  The category in aggregate is down about 2%.  We\u2019re down about 3%.  So as we\u2019ve said, there is a clear opportunity for us to improve our share performance.  We\u2019ve taken a number of steps to improve that in each of our key markets, and as I mentioned in my remarks, we\u2019re starting to see that bear some fruit.  So I would suggest that you look at our share performance in our key gum markets: Japan, U.S., Europe, France, Mexico, and Brazil.  And I would say those will be the key metrics for you to look at."," ","Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal","Are there a greater number of launches that we should be seeing as well?","Irene Rosenfeld ","Well, we\u2019ve got some new products.  We launched Stride ID in the U.S.  We have a similar version of that called Trident Twist in Europe, and so we\u2019ve got some new products.  But part of what we\u2019ve suggested has to be improved in the category is that it\u2019s a combination of some stronger innovation - I think we\u2019re on that case - but it\u2019s also about some improvement in tactical sales and marketing execution.  ","So we\u2019ve talked about the price sizing architecture.  In a number of our markets, we\u2019ve actually introduced an economy size to try to address the pack rate in an environment where our consumers are not going to a kiosk quite as often as they might have.  We\u2019ve restored A&C as we told you, to historical levels.  We are working on simplifying brand architecture so the category is easier to shop.","So all of those actions together should have a near term impact in our share performance, and as I said, that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching, and I would encourage you to look at that as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.  ","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","I guess I\u2019ll start with just some of the nonoperating items.  Dave, can you give us some sense as to what you expect for 2013 interest expense, corporate expense?  And on the tax rate, I thought you had said at the analyst day that you were looking at a mid-20s rate.  The fourth quarter seems to have come in a lot lower than we thought, so this lower rate, that\u2019s not a change for the outlook?   ","David Brearton","I\u2019ll start with, on the corporate expense, there shouldn\u2019t be anything \u201cspecial\u201d in 2013.  So I mentioned a couple of items that we had exiting the year on total SG&A.  But as we look forward, corporate will be a normal year in 2013.  Interest, we talked about at the investor day that we had a $0.02 headwind in interest versus our sort of equilibrium capital structure.  And we\u2019ve said that our target was to get to about $18 billion of debt, and we would exit the year close to $20 billion.  We exited at $19.5 billion.  And that we were carrying excess cash.  ","That will work itself out over the first half of the year as debt maturities come due in February, and again in May.  So we\u2019ll pay down those maturities.  By the end of May, we should be at where we want to be.  But during that time period, there\u2019s some inefficiency built in.  There\u2019s a couple of pennies of interest headwind very strong what you would normally expect.  So those are those two.","On taxes, we gave long term guidance of mid-20s, and I would stick to that long term guidance of mid-20s.  That is the sort of straight average of all the statutory tax rates around the world.  We said there would be some fluctuations in any given year to discrete events.  ","And I think in 2012, we finished at 20%, and the biggest discrete event in 2012 was actually a reduction in the U.K. corporate tax rate, which has an oversized impact, because we not only changed the statutory rate in the U.K., you also have to write down your deferred tax liability, so there\u2019s a correction catch up on it.  ","There is another U.K. tax rate reduction claimed in 2013 by the U.K. government, and that\u2019s built into the low-20s guidance.  So that is why you\u2019re seeing that rate come in lower.  It\u2019s going to be flat year over year, but it is lower than our long term guidance of mid-20s, primarily due to those kind of items.","Now, in terms of where that\u2019s going, we basically have said we will continue to drive the virtuous cycle.  So we\u2019ll invest in A&C, we\u2019ll invest in sales and distribution capabilities, we\u2019ll continue to look at innovation platform rollouts, and we\u2019ll cover things like the interest headwind.  So that\u2019s all part of getting to our double digit EPS growth.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","And then just so I understand it correctly, the operating income that you\u2019re using as a base to grow off of, is that about $4.41 billion?  ","David Brearton","I think it was in the schedules at the back.  It\u2019s in that range, yes.  I think if you go to the back, you\u2019ll see the operating income growth on the presentation chart.  ","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","So the high single digit growth rate that you\u2019re quoting on page 15, how is FX going to impact that?  Because obviously we have to model it in reported dollars.  So you\u2019re calling out an FX benefit on top of that?  ","David Brearton","No, I think what we\u2019ve done with the guidance is we have restated to put everything at the average 2012 rates, with one exception.  So essentially, there should be no FX impact with the exception of Venezuela.  So that\u2019s the only FX impact you would expect to see year over year.  And that\u2019s about $0.04.  So effectively, our $1.52 to $1.57 guidance includes $0.04 of negative impacts from the Venezuela devaluation.  But otherwise, there\u2019s no forex impact year over year.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","And then the last question, any mention on cash flow, what you generated as an operating cash flow number after capex in 2012, and what we should expect in 2013?   ","David Brearton","You will see the cash flow when we do the 10-K, which should be end of next week or early the following week.  Unfortunately, it will be 9 months of KFG and 3 months of Mondelez.  So we recognize that may not be helpful, because you value us on a discounted cash flow basis.  But we\u2019ll try to, as you get more quarters of Mondelez pure historically, help you work through that.  ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.  ","Jason English - Goldman Sachs ","I wanted to circle back on Catherine\u2019s question real quick, on the constant currency EPS guidance reiterated.  You\u2019ve lowered your tax rate guidance from, say, mid-20s to low 20s.  A 5% change there is like a dime.  So it\u2019s a pretty big change.  Can you help me understand, again, what\u2019s driving the implicit cut in pretax guidance?  ","David Brearton","We\u2019ve taken it down from mid-20s.  That was always going to be mid-20s as a range.  But, fine.  If it was 25% in your models, it would be $0.10.  I\u2019m not going to comment on what our internal expectations were.  But essentially, it is covering things like A&C investment sales, investment distribution, other investments to drive the top line growth, as well as the interest expense we talked about, the headwind we had on that.  ","And I think there\u2019s going to be some operational challenges in a place like Venezuela that is not part of the currency we just talked about.  We covered the operational issues, if consumers react negatively to price increases, ourselves, internally.  So those are the kinds of things that will be included in that.","I\u2019d also remind you that the EPS growth on a constant currency basis, if you do the math of what we told you today, would be 12-15%, which I think is pretty healthy.  So that\u2019s where it\u2019s going.  ","Jason English - Goldman Sachs ","One more follow up.  Coffee price headwind.  You\u2019re saying it abates as we lap the price reductions in the third quarter.  Assuming most of the market [is fine on] a lagged cost curve, which history suggests it does, costs have continued to fall well past the last price reduction in the third quarter.  Isn\u2019t it prudent for us to assume that yet another price reduction will be necessary?  ","David Brearton","We don\u2019t comment on our pricing strategy.  I can\u2019t really go into what might or might not happen in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.  ","David Palmer - UBS","You mentioned in the slides and several times in the call that A&C spending was up in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s going to be going up in 2013.  Could you speak to where that investment is going, or went, and your hope for the payoff in revenue terms that you\u2019re expecting, particularly in developing markets?  ","Irene Rosenfeld ","It\u2019s going almost entirely behind our power brands.  There\u2019s a reason that our power brands are growing at twice the rate of revenue of the base business, and so we continue to invest disproportionately in the power brands, and in these global innovation platforms.  And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to fuel our growth.  ","David Palmer - UBS","Are these reinvestment rates representing an acceleration, and therefore, at least internally, you\u2019re hoping for and expecting an acceleration in these organic revenue growth rates?  ","Irene Rosenfeld ","No.  Again, if you look at our results for this year, we ended the year up about 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue, in terms of our A&C investment.  It is a driver of our core franchises, and as we look at the performance of each of our individual categories, as well as our share performance, we\u2019re feeling quite good about that.  ","David Palmer - UBS","You mentioned a temporary drag from Canada.  I don\u2019t know if you mentioned how much of a drag that was, and if that was something you\u2019re expecting to be corrected by the first quarter results?  ","Irene Rosenfeld ","I didn\u2019t mention specifically what it was, but I did say it\u2019s the major variance between the expectations that we had for the fourth quarter and the [37] that we delivered.  So we are quite comfortable that we will see a rebound in Canada, in the first quarter, relative to the performance in the fourth quarter.  ","Again, it is a fully integrated business, and unlike the U.S. sales force, where we had a separate DSD organization to begin with, in Canada, our selling organization was fully integrated.  So we had a lot more complexity as we took it apart.  But we\u2019re quite comfortable.  Most of those issues occurred early in the quarter, and we\u2019re quite comfortable as we come out of the first quarter that we\u2019ll see a rebound there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.  ","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolas ","","Just had two questions for you.  I wanted to ask about the developing market business overall, and if you expect that to achieve double digit revenue growth in 2013.  Did you say that?  Or is that something that you could speak to for this year?"," ","Irene Rosenfeld ","Without a doubt, over the long term we expect that our developing markets will deliver a double digit rate of growth, and it continues to be a very exciting opportunity for us.  We did say it would take us a couple of quarters to get the momentum back.  ","We\u2019re feeling quite good about where Brazil is performing.  Russia will take a little longer.  It certainly has improved quite nicely from Q3, but it\u2019s going to take a little bit longer to get that business performing back up to its historical contribution.  So net-net, our developing markets over the long term will certainly contribute at a double digit rate, and we should see that performance begin to play out in the course of 2013.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolas ","","And then I know also we\u2019ve talked before about the gum business, and the challenges there.  As you think about your revenue growth guidance, not so much for this year, but the next few years, couple years, is gum continuing to decline?  And then [unintelligible] getting above, say 5% of the lower end of the range?  Is it that meaningful, and therefore that big of a potential drag that it could be more toward the lower end of your guidance range?  ","David Brearton","I guess the simple answer is no, gum is slightly under 9% of our revenue.  So we are not counting, when we gave you the low end of 5-7%.  That was driven primarily by the coffee and the capacity constraints.  Gum, at that kind of level, costs us 20 or 30 basis points, but it\u2019s not a significant drag on the total business.  We\u2019d like to see it get back to its historical growth rates, but it\u2019s not a reason to be concerned about our long term guidance.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolas ","","And if I could ask one more, which is you had some product pruning throughout 2012.  Is there any expectation for that to continue, or any territories [where that will] continue in 2013?  ","David Brearton","It will just be normal pruning that any company does, frankly.  There were a couple of big things.  There was one in Canada this year that we have talked about, where it was essentially a co-man contract left over from a previous divestiture.  So it was large.  Most of the other stuff we would do is stuff any of the people you cover would do in the normal course of business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.  ","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","I wanted to know if you have an outlook for us for cash flow for 2013.  Kraft, in the past, used to give cash flow guidance and now both Kraft and Mondelez don\u2019t give it as much anymore.  And I wanted to know why the change, and at a minimum, maybe you can help us walk through the big building blocks for cash flow in \u201913.   ","David Brearton","Yeah, I think the reason for the change is not because I don\u2019t like cash flow, it\u2019s just because it\u2019s been really hard through the spin to delineate Kraft Foods Group versus Mondelez full year cash flow.  So I know what my cash flow was in quarter four, obviously, and we are very pleased with that, but when you see our cash flow statement, it will be a combination of Mondelez for one quarter and KFG for three.  And I think that\u2019s the same reason you\u2019ll get a little bit of reticence from our colleagues over at the Kraft Foods Group.","Directionally, I think as part of the spinoff documentation we actually had information in there that would have allowed you to separate the cash flow between the old KFG companies. And for \u201911 and \u201910 you could more or less say half went to each company.  ","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","I\u2019m really asking about guidance for \u201913.  You used to give cash flow guidance, and I don\u2019t think you give it as much anymore.  ","David Brearton","That would be correct.  At this stage, I\u2019m not going to give guidance today.  As we get a little more information to you on the balance sheet over time, you\u2019ll get more guidance on that.  But it won\u2019t be today.  ","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.  ","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein ","Can I ask about the growth margins?  As I look at the GAAP numbers reported today, it looks as though they were up a couple of hundred basis points.  I wondered whether that was as commodity cost pressures have moderated, you\u2019re beginning to see some expansion there, or maybe there are other one-time factors in there that I\u2019m not seeing.  But as I look out through 2013, what do you think is the shape of the gross margin outlook?  Can you quantify whether you expect it to be up, down, or sideways in 2013?  ","David Brearton","A lot of the gross margin gains for last year would have been to do with some of the integration costs, etc. associated with Cadbury.  So if you strip all that kind of thing out, our gross margins, we would say, on the year were up sort of in the mid-50 basis points, let\u2019s say.  And we\u2019re quite happy with that.  We think that\u2019s a good performance.  ","And there\u2019s nothing really one-time in nature in that.  That legitimately is pricing to cover input costs and a very strong productivity program driving gross margin gains.  So that\u2019s what we did in 2012.  We don\u2019t give guidance going forward, but it clearly is part of our virtuous cycle strategy that we grow gross margin every year as a way to reinvest in A&C and sales.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein ","And the 200 basis points in the fourth quarter, is that like-for-like, or is there too many moving pieces in that?  ","David Brearton","It\u2019s too many moving parts.  The P&Ls that get attached to the press release are the continuing operations P&L, so there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces in there.  ","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein ","And then just as we look out to 2013, how much are you anticipating A&C spend being up next year?  ","David Brearton","Again, we won\u2019t give guidance on individual parts of the P&L, but it\u2019s part of our strategy that we\u2019ll continue to invest in A&C.  ","Operator","We have time for one more question.  Your final question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.  ","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","I\u2019m just going to try one last time, just with a slightly different question regarding cash flow.  Specifically on network capital, if we look at the balance sheet historically, and perhaps there\u2019s some degree of pro forma adjustments factoring into this, but it does look like your network capital relative to sales is fairly high when compared to the peer group.  Can you sort of address that in a more general way, what the key opportunities might be for improving working capital efficiencies going forward?  ","David Brearton","I\u2019d start by saying the biggest differentiation on us versus our peer group often comes down to geographic.  Roughly 40% of our business is in Europe, and Europe tends to have very long receivables versus other markets.  And most of our peers have much lower working capital in developing markets than North America, as we do.  ","So I think that\u2019s probably one of the big drivers.  That said, we\u2019d agree with you there\u2019s opportunity in working capital, and we\u2019re quite active at looking at benchmarks and what are the best practices out there, and what are the things we should aspire to, and we do see opportunity in working capital.  So I can\u2019t judge for you whether we\u2019re better or worse than some of the peers you\u2019re looking at, but I can tell you we do believe there\u2019s opportunity, yes.  ","Thank you everyone for joining the call.  Any follow up questions, please address Nick or I. We\u2019ll be standing by and ready to talk.  Thanks.  Bye.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondelez management and a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay","Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Brearton, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release. This release and today's slides are available on our website mondelezinternational.com.","As you know, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.

You could find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks Dexter and good afternoon. Our second quarter and first half results played out essentially as we told you they would. Although our top line was below our long-term target, our underlying business fundamentals were solid. We exited the second quarter with strong volume mix and power brand games.","Faster growth in emerging markets and increasing market shares around the world. This Positions us well to accelerate organic revenue growth and expand margins in the back half of the year and in 2014. Earlier today we also announced a substantial increase in our share repurchase program as well as an increase in our quarterly dividend, our first raise since 2008. These actions reflect our Board\u2019s confidence in our future, our balance sheet strength and our commitment to create value for our shareholders.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at the key metrics behind our first half results. In both the second quarter and first half we delivered organic revenue growth of 3.8%. As I mentioned, as for lower long-term target, but consistent with our first half guidance. As expected, the impact of lower coffee prices and capacity constraints, tempered revenue growth by about 1.3 percentage points.","But need at the top line: 7p line number, our fundamentals were solid. I say that for several reasons. First we delivered high quality growth fueled by strong volume mix. In fact volume mix accounted for about three points for more than 75% of our top line growth. What\u2019s more, this strength was wide spread. We grew volume mix in each of our regions.","We are especially proud of the performance of our European team, who once again grow strong underlying revenue in a very challenging macro environment. Second, our focus on power brands continue to payoff, with revenue up 8% in the first half, more than double the total company rate.","Third, our two largest categories posted strong revenue growth. Biscuits grew 8%, while chocolate was up 6%. Although gum remains a challenge, we\u2019re seeing some encouraging signs of share recovery. Fourth in emerging markets, revenue growth was 9.5%.Over the past few quarters; it has accelerated from 8.4% in Q4 last year to 9.3% in Q1 to 9.7% in Q2. Importantly, it\u2019s now approaching our long-term target of double-digit growth. Revenue in BRIC markets also continue to improve sequentially, up nearly 13% in Q2, including very strong results in both Russia and Brazil.","Fifth, we\u2019re taking the opportunity to fast track a number of emerging market investments, originally planned for the future. The impact of this is more than offset by the benefit of some tax favorability. These investments will generate attractive returns and are expected to benefit both revenue growth and margin expansion in 2014.","And finally, our share performance was terrific. On a global basis, we\u2019re gaining or holding share in nearly 60% of our revenue, with particular strengths in biscuits, chocolate and coffee.","Let\u2019s take a closer look and results in each of our core categories. As I mentioned a moment ago, biscuits were up 8% in the first half. In emerging markets revenue increased low teens, led by growth in Latin America. In developed markets, biscuits were up mid single-digits with strong growth in both North America and Europe.","Our power brand grew 12%. Globally Oreo was up nearly 15% and belVita Tuc\/Club Social, Barni and Chips Ahoy! each posted impressive growth. In addition, we continue to deliver outstanding share performance with more than three quarters of revenue in key markets, gaining or holding share.","In chocolate, global revenue was up 6%. In emerging markets revenue was up low teens with strong growth across all geographies. The Dallas markets were up low single digits. Power brands grew 11%. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up double-digits, including more than 20% in Asia Pacific. Milka increased double-digits, while Lacta delivered solid growth. Our chocolate share also remained strong with more than half of our revenue in key markets gaining or holding share.","Turning to Gum and Candy, Global revenue declined 2% in the first half. Candy was up mid single digits, driven by halls. Gum in emerging markets was also uplift single digits, led by the successful launch of Stride in China. So the challenge continues to be gum in developed markets, which was down mid to high teens. However, we\u2019re beginning to get some traction from the four initiatives that we\u2019ve been executing.","The enterprise size architecture, stronger marketing campaigns focused on Fresh Breath and oral care, more impactful displays and getting the right product assortment on shelf. In the second quarter, gum shares increased in the U.S. for the first time in a couple of years. And also grew in most of our European markets as we implemented the same initiatives.","Despite the share recovery, revenue led somewhat due to the short-term impacts on inventory and our customers reset their shelves. This should correct itself, as the year progresses. Finally, in beverages and cheese and grocery, first half revenues help study with power brands up 3%. As expected coffee was down mid single digits, as we\u2019ve pass through significantly lower Green coffee cards. But this nabs the underlying moment.","Vol mix was up mid single digits and market shares were strong, with more than half of revenue in key markets, gaining for holding share. In addition, our Tassimo business continues to thrive. Revenues grew nearly 40% in the first half as brewer sales more than doubled. Finally in powdered beverages, we once again delivered double-digit growth led by Tang.","With that as background, let's take a closer look at our top line results by region. In Latin America, organic revenue was up 9.6% in the second quarter and more than 11% in the first half. Brazil delivered strong growth, despite an increasingly challenged economic environment and softening category trends. The business grew low teens with a good balance between vol\/mix and pricing.","Outside Brazil, most of the region's growth was driven by pricing in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina. We remain cautious on these markets due to their volatility. Overall, the region's power brands increased 13% led by Club Social, Oreo, Halls and belVita.","In Asia Pacific, organic revenue grew 3.3% in the second quarter and 4.6% in the first half with vol\/mix gains driving nearly all of the growth. The region's power brands grew 18% led by Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Stride and Tang. The story in this region, however, is a Tale of Two Cities or more precisely a tale of the contrast between emerging and developed markets.","Emerging markets across the region were up double digits in the first half, including mid teens growth in China and low double digits in India. Despite its strong results, China slowed sequentially from more than 20% in Q1 to low double digits in Q2, reflecting softening category trends in biscuits. Our power brands, Oreo and Chips Ahoy!, delivered solid gains but some of our smaller brands declined. The success of Stride gum, however, continued to boost our top line.","In India, we again delivered double digit growth led by Cadbury Dairy Milk. That's despite capacity constraints that continue to temper growth in chocolate. With new production lines now on stream, we expect revenue to accelerate in the second half, as we look to fully support the category which continues to grow at more than 20% a year. In contrast, the developed markets in the region were down low to mid single digits mainly due to gum and candy weakness in both Japan and Australia.","Turning to EEMEA, organic revenue grew 11.3% in the second quarter and nearly 8% in the first half, fueled by strong vol\/mix gains across most markets. Power brands grew 12% led by Cadbury Dairy Milk, Oreo, Barni, Tuc and Tang. Our turnaround in Russia drove the growth as we significantly improved our sales execution. In the second quarter, Russia was up mid teens as exceptionally strong vol\/mix was partially offset by lower pricing in coffee and chocolate.","Looking at Europe, organic revenue increased modestly up two-tenths of a percent in both the second quarter and first half. Vol\/mix gains were largely offset by lower coffee pricing. In fact lower coffee revenues reduced Europe's overall growth by 1.3 points in the quarter and nearly 2 points in the half. But our vol\/mix was exceptional, up 3.8 percentage points in Q2 and up sequentially from 1.3 points in the first quarter.","In the first half, chocolate revenues rose mid-single digits driven almost entirely by vol\/mix. Biscuits were up mid-single digits with about three quarters of the gain due to vol\/mix. Oreo, belVita and our Choco-Bakery platforms delivered much of the growth. Coffee was down mid-single digits due to pricing but our convenient coffee format such as Millicano and Tassimo were up strongly. Gum and candy revenues were down high single digits, all due to gum. And power brands increased 3% across the regions.","In North America, organic revenues increased 2.3% in the second quarter and 2.4% in the first half. U.S. biscuits was a standout with revenues up more than 5% in the second quarter. In fact that represents the eight consecutive quarter of growth of 5% or more. Oreo, Honey Maid, belVita, Chips Ahoy!, and Triscuit each made solid contributions to the first half.","This business continues to benefit from the renewed focus on in-store execution by our direct store delivery sales force following the spin. For example, through our one more in the store initiative we increased the number of displays nearly 17% in Q2. DSD is also a key enabler to get our new products on shelf. In the first half, 9 of the top 10 new biscuit products in the U.S. were ours.","As a result, our market share is up 140 basis points in the quarter and 100 points year-to-date. In contrast, gum and candy was down high single digits. Candy once again delivered solid gains but gum declined shortly as our customers reset their shelf assortments. As I mentioned earlier though, our gum share in the U.S. has improved, gaining four-tenths of a point in Q2 and a full point in the last four weeks of the quarter.","From a margin perspective, we have a lot of work to do but we're making progress toward our goal of increasing margins by 500 basis points over the next five years. We recently announced plans to invest approximately $350 million in the construction of a new biscuit manufacturing facility in Mexico. When its stores open in the second half of 2014, this facility will support biscuit growth across the Americas and will enhance margins by utilizing state-of-the-art technologies that enable manufacturing at world-class costs.","We also announced our transition to a category led organization effective January 2014. Modeled after our success in Europe, this structure is designed to simplify processes, reduce costs and increase the speed of decision making. Ultimately we expect this category led structure will accelerate top line growth, drive share and improve margins, much as it did in Europe.","With that, let me turn it over to Dave to discuss margins, earnings and our outlook for the balance of the year.","David Brearton","Thanks, Irene. Good afternoon. As Irene just described, we're poised to accelerate revenue growth in the second half and into 2014. We expect gross profit margin to expand in the back half of the year as well, as productivity programs pick up speed and as we drive leverage from stronger revenue growth.","In the first half, however, adjusted gross margin was essentially flat as pricing and vol\/mix gains offset higher input costs. Adjusted operating income margin in the second quarter improved sequentially to 11.4%, up from 10.3% in the Q1. For the first half, however, adjusted OI margin was 10.8%, down 170 basis points but in line with the expectations we communicated earlier this year.","The results reflect a combination of factors, including about 50 basis points from cycling prior year one-time items, about 30 points from devaluation of the Venezuelan currency and about 20 points from ongoing restructuring costs.","In addition, we invested over $100 million to drive growth in emerging markets. While this tempered margins by about 70 basis points in the first half, it sets us up for a much stronger 2014 on both the top and bottom lines.","Turning now to earnings per share. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.37 including a negative $0.01 impact from currency. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 5.6%. For the first half, adjusted EPS was $0.71 including a negative $0.05 impact from currency. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 13.4% driven primarily by lower taxes. As I mentioned, however, our incremental investments in emerging markets were a key driver of the $0.04 decline in operating earnings.","Turning to guidance, we continue to expect organic revenue this year to grow at the low end over 5% to 7% long-term term target. And on the bottom line we\u2019re reaffirming our outlook for adjusted EPS of $1.55 to $1.60. This range reflects average 2012 foreign exchange rates as well as an estimated negative $0.04 impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar.","As you know the dollar has strengthened since the start of the year. Based on translation impacts recorded to date and spot rates as of July 31, our EPS would be about a nickel lower than the $1.55 to $1.60 guidance. We totally recognize that reaching our full-year outlook will require a step-up in top-line growth and margin expansion in the back half. So, let me give you some understanding of why we believe we\u2019ll deliver.","In the second half we expect to achieve top-line growth of about 6% despite a slowdown in our categories that we and many of our peers are experiencing. Let me tell you why. First, we\u2019re entering the second half with good momentum. Our vol mix gains and market share performance have been strong. Second, in the first half we faced headwinds from capacity constraints and lower coffee pricing which together with nearly a 1.5 drag. We don\u2019t expect capacity constraints to be a significant issue going forward.","Coffee pricing will still be a headwind, but we expect it to be less than the one point impact in the first half. Third, we have favorable comparisons with the prior-year especially in Q3. And fourth, our emerging market investments in sales capabilities, route to market expansion and A&C support behind our power brands will reinforce our momentum and should help offset the impact of slower category growth.","With respect to margins, we continue to expect adjusted OI margin to be essentially flat at about 12% for the year. With the first half coming in at just under 11% this implies a second half margin of about 13%. How will we get there? First, in the back half we expect non-sales overheads to be in line with prior-year as cost reduction programs lessen the impact of the synergies. As a result we should benefit from overhead leverage as revenues increase.","The impact of this should be even more pronounced in the fourth quarter due to its higher revenue contribution. And second, a disproportion amount of benefits from productivity are routed to the back half. As we outlined in recent investor conferences we expect to increase our adjusted OI margin to 14% to 16% within the next five years. That starting from 12.2% in 2012 with the 2015 target of about 13%. That\u2019s over 13.5% excluding ongoing restructuring charges.","Let me give you a sense of how that plays out specifically for 2013 and 2014. As you can see on this chart base margins will expand in line with our algorithm both this year and next about 60 to 90 points per year. Next month at the Back-To-School Conference, we\u2019ll provide more details on our plans to deliver this base margin increase. Originally we targeted spending about $100 million on investments in emerging markets this year.","As we mentioned in May based on affordability, opportunity and return we\u2019ve chosen to accelerate a number of investments that were originally planned in the future. As a result, rather than a 20 to 30 basis point impact we now expect these investments to more than double and temper margins to 50 to 70 points this year. That creates a bigger margin headwind in 2013, but that spending is now inner base, which means a much smaller incremental impact in 2014.","These programs are all expected to generate returns well in excess of our cost to capital and deliver sustainable profitable growth. In China for example, we\u2019re improving sales coverage in traditional trade outlets in Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets, as well as continuing to develop routes to market in Tier 3 and 4 cities. We\u2019re also increasing A&C to create brand awareness in these new outlets.","In India we are expanding distribution in the South as well as stepping up A&C support. And in Russia we\u2019re investing in sales capabilities that will improve our availability in the hot zone and traditional trade outlets. Across these markets we expect increased A&C to translate into improved share results in the second half of this year and in the next year. Benefits from investments in sales and distribution will take a little longer to realize, but should contribute in 2014.","Also as we said in May, in addition to the 2012 to 2014 restructuring program, we intend to invest up to $100 million in ongoing restructuring in 2013; that will reduce margins by about 10 to 20 basis points this year. We plan to invest somewhat more in 2014 on route to the $200 million to $300 million in annual spending we will reach in 2015. This spending is key to the cost reduction efforts needed to deliver our long-term margin goals.","So in 2013 as we said, we expect adjusted OI margin to be roughly flat at about 12%, but in 2014 we\u2019ll get the benefit of two years in one as much of our base margin increase will flow through. So we expect to expand margins to the high 12\u2019s next year. So how do we expect to drive double-digit EPS growth this year as we increase in our emerging market investments? The answer is lower taxes.","In the first half our adjusted tax rate was around 6%, which reflected a number of discrete items. For the full-year we now expect our tax rate to be 12% to 14%. That implies the tax rate in the second half of 16% to 20%. The Q3 rate is likely to be well below that range while the Q4 rate will be higher. In terms of EPS the lower tax rate will generate a benefit of $0.11 to $0.14 for the full-year. Putting it all together we expect adjusted EPS to be $0.84 to $0.89 in the second half, and for the full-year we continue to expect 14% to 18% EPS growth on a constant currency basis.","Let me now turn it back to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Before I wrap up, in a separate press release today we announced our intention to increase the return of capital to shareholders. As you may recall at Cadbury we committed to resuming share buybacks and dividend increases once our leverage ratios were back in line with our targeted credit rating. As a reminder our priorities for cash are first and foremost to invest in the business to drive sustainable, profitable growth; and as we\u2019ve discussed we\u2019re doing that.","We\u2019re also aggressively expanding capacity, increasing capital expenditures for about 4% of revenues to about 5%. That includes for example the expansion of a biscuit plant in China, the construction of the new growth facility in Mexico that I mentioned earlier and a new Greenfield site in India. It also includes a number of other high return expansions around the world.","Our second priority for cash is tack-on acquisitions. At present we believe we have ample flexibility to manage the M&A opportunities that may become available in the near term. The third priority for cash is the return of capital to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and\/or higher dividends. And the fourth is paying down debt.","We have now reduced our gross debt to about $18 billion and net debt to about $15.5 billion. At these levels our leverage ratio is now consistent with our target rating, investment grade with access to CP. So with investments fully funded, and a solid credit profile, we can now return more capital to shareholders while still preserving our ability to pursue future strategic opportunities.","As such, today we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.14, a share an increase of a penny were 8%. We are also significantly increasing our current shipper buyback authorization to $6 billion or about $1 billion to $2 billion annually through 2016. We believe that the combination of double digit EPS growth, higher dividends and a substantial increase in share buybacks creates a highly attractive mix that taken together will drive superior returns for our shareholders.","So to wrap up, our first half results demonstrated solid underlying business momentum including strong vol mix and power brand gains, faster growth in emerging markets and increasing market shares globally. We\u2019ll build on these strengths in the second half to deliver improved performance. On the top line, we'll benefit from our first half momentum and increased investments in emerging markets, as headwinds from coffee pricing and capacity constraints begin to subside.","On the bottom line, we expect margins to expand as revenue growth accelerates and as we aggressively drive productivity and overhead cost savings. As a result, we're positioned to deliver our commitments for 2013 and to drive sustainable profitable growth in 2014 and beyond.","Now, we'd be happy to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. Good afternoon.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hello, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. Just two questions for you. The first one I'd like to ask is, as you think about the emerging market investment, Irene, you have some tax favorability in the first quarter, you have some more here in this quarter. You let some of that flow through in the first quarter. I just want to get an understanding now like all the tax benefits that are coming through this year, should we assume that the majority of those are being reinvested back in the business? I'm trying to put some color around the amount of incremental reinvestment back in the business.","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, I think Chris we gave you a schedule to show that. We said we generate about $0.11 to $0.14 favorability from taxes. We gave about $0.03 back in the first quarter as you recall. Our investments are about $0.06 and that just gives you a sense of how we're thinking about that.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then if I could also ask a question, I guess maybe more for Dave, regarding your increase to the share repurchase authorization and your increasing the repurchased shares. Is there an expectation that you would take on debt? I was trying to think about your free cash flow over the next year or two, is that free cash flow growing as fast than you expected and allowing you to do more share repurchase activity or is there the capacity to take on some more debt?","David Brearton","The free cash flow is pretty much in line with what we laid out at CAGNY at this point in time, but I think as you think about what we said at CAGNY '13 and '14 we still got the restructuring program spending in there. As we keep going forward beyond '14 that was disappear out of the base and we'll be delivering a stronger cash flow. So we may have to take on a small amount of incremental debt in the near term, but I think it's well within what we can afford as we go over time.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, thanks for the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Good evening, everyone.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","One thing I wanted to follow-up on, on Chris' question just to make sure I fully understand the new fully year guidance. When you reported the first quarter you mentioned you were holding I think $0.03 to $0.04 of tax flexibility in your pocket for the rest of the year. And as I look at your current guidance, you're saying it is still $1.55 to $1.60 but you'd also be this quarter tax is more favorable than you thought even at the end of the first quarter and relative to our model interest expense was also much more favorable. So I'm just trying to get a sense of where some of that flexibility is going?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yeah, Andrew, we're still looking to keep our powder dry as we looked at the balance of the year. There's quite a bit of volatility in a number of these markets and we want to make sure that we are appropriately hedged to deliver our commitment.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Okay. We're now I guess five weeks into your third quarter and I wanted to get a sense from you, if you could, just even directionally of the trends you're seeing so far in the third quarter relatively consistent with your expectation for the kind of acceleration you're expecting in \u2013 most importantly in the organic rate of top line growth that you're looking for in the second half of the year?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yeah, I don't want to give you week-by-week guidance but what I will tell you is certainly we've expressed great confidence in the back half of the year for all the reasons we've said and there's nothing we're seeing that's inconsistent with that.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A question about as we look at the organic sales performance in the first half and especially the second quarter, one thing that's been really encouraging is that volumes have accelerated sequentially over the last couple of quarters. And if you go back to some of the years where the period where organic sales growth was at the high end of your range, there was probably more of a pricing component. Actually volume wasn't really a big contributor to revenue growth. So I guess what I'm asking is you move into the second half of the year, do you expect that vol\/mix to continue to be in that 3% to 4% range in terms of the contribution of revenue growth? First. And then second, of all the pieces that are still sort of below sort of your long-term expectations, whether it's gum, some of the developed markets, coffee contribution, where do you think we should look for sort of the acceleration? Should it come from even more growth in the emerging markets or should some of those weaker areas begin to contribute more?","David Brearton","Yeah, I think on the first step, I can cover that and Irene can cover the second step. I think when you go back to those days when we had much lower vol\/mix, it was a very high pricing environment. That was when we had the commodity run up and naturally there was a bit of pullback on vol\/mix as consumers on the trade front reacted to those price increases. Obviously we're in a very benign pricing environment today, so all of the entire revenue growth you're seeing is coming from vol\/mix. As we look at the back half, I'm not looking to input costs to increase or pricing to measurably improve, so most of that revenue improvement at the back half is going to have to come from vol\/mix.","Irene Rosenfeld","But if you think about it, just to put it in some perspective, Bryan, I think if we think about the 3A, as we said, we believe that about a 1.3 points is due to \u2013 coffee is about 1 point and about 0.3 due to capacity constraints. As we then exit the first half, those headwinds will \u2013 certainly in terms of coffee will lessen. It's still going to be there. The capacity constraint should be behind us. And so as we look to what we're going to execute in the back half, we feel quite comfortable that the momentum we've got in the front half, it's the spending that we've got in our emerging markets and our overall share performance will carry us through.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I guess it stands to reason that your confidence in increasing A&C spending in the second half will have an influence because you're really targeting consumption growth as opposed to pricing? I mean the idea is that if you spend more on advertising and consumer spend, you should drive even more consumption.","Irene Rosenfeld","That's correct. But I would also tell you that the programs that we are investing behind are proven programs. I mean it seems like the launch of Golden Oreo in China, the route expansions that Dave alluded to in both China and India, it was some incremental preseason support on Tang, these are proven programs that we have invested in, so we have high confidence that we'll get a good return on those investments.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","Great. Thank you. Good evening, everyone.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi, David.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","Wanted to \u2013 Dave, wanted to just maybe ask very directly the EPS guidance or \u2013 you didn't actually give it, but on the third quarter it seems like you're expecting stronger revenue growth but the OI margin expansion isn't as good as in the fourth quarter. There seem to be a number of puts and takes on the tax rate, et cetera. Bottom line, would the third quarter EPS all-in, it should be a little bit less than the EPS contribution for the fourth quarter? I think I've taken into account everything, but can you confirm that?","David Brearton","Well, I don't want to give you quarterly EPS but I can give you two pieces to sort of help. Firstly on the OI margins, I wouldn't compare to prior year because prior year was pretty unusual given the timing of a lot of spending OI revenue as we were preparing for the spin. So last year was pretty unusual. This year I think it's going to be more normal. You'll see our OI margins improve progressively through the year and our high points will be in quarter four. So that would be the first point. Secondly on the taxes, we did say a few minutes ago that we would expect our taxes in the back half to be higher but frankly Q3 is going to be well below that 15% to 20% rate I said just a minute ago and Q4 will be higher. And again, it is because of some discrete items that we would expect to get Q3 \u2013 that will benefit Q3. So those are two elements I can give you some guidance on.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","And then, Dave, just three other quick ones. Tax rate, I get this question a lot. Is the low tax rate in 2013 going to be a headwind for 2014 or is the comment that you reinvested it and that even when this tax rate normalizes to something higher, the fact is, is that there are other pieces of the P&L that will change in '14 to compensate. Is that a correct way of thinking about the tax issue?","David Brearton","We've given guidance for our tax rate for the next three to five years, but it's going to be around 20% plus or minus. This year was usually low. So I'm not going to give specific guidance for next year but this year was really \u2013 [I mean] last year was about 20%, this year was down quite a bit below that. Going forward over the next three to five years, I would expect to see closer to 20 again. In terms of special offsets, I may be returning back to instead of the OI conversation we had, by accelerating the emerging market investments from future periods into 2013 we\u2019ve essentially built that into our base and so it means we\u2019re going to get two years of OI margin, the expansion in one next year, and we would expect our margins to grow from, so we said this year flat to last year up in the high 12\u2019s next year. And so our EPS next year is largely going to be OI driven.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","Okay, final two from me, fast ones; in marketing -- what was marketing up in the first half of the year and last question on interest expense can you give us interest expense guidance for \u201913?","David Brearton","Marketing is about 9.5% of revenue, so it's similar to what it was in the first quarter. And interest expense, I mean I wouldn\u2019t expect we had a small one timer that we recall that as we talked about it, that was $0.01 to $0.02, but otherwise I\u2019d say our trend on interest should be relatively even through the year.","Dexter Congbalay","Yeah, we\u2019re about $18 billion on gross debt and our weighted average rate is about 5.9%.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","You had some options in the back half of the year that were in debt pay down, so I think there were questions as to whether or not interest expense was going to change in the final couple of quarters. So you\u2019re saying second quarter run rate is a good run rate?","David Brearton","Yeah, we will be with that $1.8 billion coming due in October. We expect to pay that off through the combination of cash and commercial paper issuance.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","Okay. Thank you.","David Brearton","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi, a follow-up to David Driscoll question, I think you said that marketing was 9.5% of revenue in Q1 and Q2, but what was it last year, and does it reflect an increase in marketing spending year-over-year? And then secondly, just to drilldown a little bit on U.S. gum, we took a look at some Kantar media data and it showed big declines in tracked media spending in U.S. gum. I think it could have been reflected on the fact that you might be increasing digital in your mix, but I thought that you had a lot of digital spending last year too so, just trying to get a sense of whether the advertising cuts might have caused some of this decline in U.S. gum? Thanks.","David Brearton","I\u2019ll answer the first bit, last year our spending was 9.4% of revenue versus last year you would see within our mix we\u2019re spending a lot more in emerging markets and we\u2019re a little tighter in the developed markets.","Irene Rosenfeld","Rob, we feel quite comfortable with the level of spending we have behind our gum as I\u2019ve talked about, we have made some important changes in the price size architecture, we have strengthened our campaigns. Any declines that you see are really reflecting the mix we're increasingly investing at point of buying as opposed to on television for example it's much more focused on digital and point of buying, and so you would see a reported change in Kantar, but it does not reflect this level of support that we got behind the business and as you see from the share numbers that I quoted to you, we\u2019re feeling very good about the results that this spending is generating.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay, and then one more question on the guidance. You said that you\u2019ve seen some slowing growth in categories in China, Russia and Brazil; to what extent did that affect your overall top line; like if you -- could you quantify what that would mean just to the category growth assumption for the year and just to give you the sense of how much harder your business has to work to grow for the remainder of the year to offset it?","Irene Rosenfeld","We\u2019ll only give specifics on perspectives, we start with the fact that we\u2019re going by share -- growing or holding share in about 60% of our revenue. So, a key prospect to the slowing category is our share gains and we\u2019re seeing very strong share performance around the world and a lot of the investment that we\u2019re making in our franchises particularly in the emerging markets is designed to help us there. But just for perspective if you think about the BRIC markets for example, GDP has gone down from about 5% -- year-to-date about 5% it was about 6% the same time a year ago and yet our revenue within those markets is up 13%. So there is not a direct correlation or should there be. There\u2019s no question we have to work harder in the phase of some of these category slowdowns, but the strength of our brand the investments that we\u2019re putting behind brand equity as well as route to market is what will carry us.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Got it. So you\u2019re up double digit that\u2019s more than enough to offset 1% change in BRIC GDP?","Irene Rosenfeld","As an example, yes in aggregate, yeah.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good evening.","David Brearton","Hi, Eric.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Dave, I guess let me ask you a question on -- I think maybe it was Chris Growe; but when I do the math you basically have about $3 billion of net income, you\u2019ve got depreciation and amortization of $1 billion to $1.3 billion, CapEx has been running $2 billion and your dividend are at least two and you\u2019re increasing that, and that evens out to a free cash flow after dividends of basically zero. So, where is other than just straight out leveraging over the next year or two until CapEx comes down, where is the share repo funding coming from?","David Brearton","Yeah, I think when we talked at Cagney, we actually laid out our cumulative cash flow over the \u201913 and \u201914 period. And so if you can go back and look at that, but I think we essentially said we had about $1 billion year-end facility. And I think what we\u2019re talking about here if we\u2019re buying $1 billion to $2 billion there\u2019s no question but if you take the midpoint of that in the short-term we would have a modest increase in our debt, but I think as we wind through that restructuring program and the cash spending on that goes through this is a program that we can take forever or in cash flow cash flow. So there will be a short-term increment, but it won't be big.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then unrelated question but when I look at your performance in the latest quarter across the regions, most of them are actually pretty solid in terms of volume mix and this EEMEA outlier of up 12. know you said there was a big recovery in Russia, but I\u2019m just a little worried that in the past the Company has been kind of stung by over shipping consumption, and we\u2019ll find out later that it was a kind of a false positive. So why shouldn\u2019t I be worried that one segment was so strong relative to everywhere else in the world. I mean was Russia just a complete disaster a year ago and it's such a strong rebound or maybe you could add a little more color there?","David Brearton","Yeah, I think I\u2019d say two things. Number one, Russia did have a very strong rebound and that\u2019s the combination of good marketing and share gains beginning this year, but it's off pace as well as year ago; so that is true. But also I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got good growth in most of the EEMEA markets. We\u2019re growing well over 20% in Egypt, we\u2019re growing well in Ukraine, we\u2019re growing in high single-digits down in South Africa; we\u2019re growing in double digits in North Africa and Nigeria. As well I think as you may recall from the first quarter in the Saudi Arabian markets we had a joint venture that we set up and essentially had to wind down the shipments to a existing distribution network and didn\u2019t ship much in that first quarter. So we got a rebound from that as we get back to normal shipments in quarter two. So there\u2019s a lot of factors. Would I expect to be growing 12% vol mix every quarter? No. But I think we feel pretty good that it is wide spread strength, and no I\u2019m not worried that we\u2019re shipping ahead of consumption.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay, excellent. Thank you.","David Brearton","Thanks Eric.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Good evening everyone. Two questions; first of all the investments -- the $100 million investments in sales capabilities and route to market expansion in A&C support, could you tell us a little bit about where those are being deployed. Are they in the already profitable BRIC countries or is this the beginning of getting into the next wave markets that presumably aren\u2019t making money as yet?","Irene Rosenfeld","No, at this time Alexia the focus is on the already good gross margin BRIC markets, it's investments as I said behind and if you think about the A&C support, business \u2013 buy businesses like Oreo, in particular I talked about Golden Oreo launch in China, it's the opportunity to continue to expand our sales coverage both in China and in India, and it's the opportunity to continue to expand some of our innovation platforms. So these are proven programs that have high returns and that\u2019s why we felt quite comfortable accelerating them.","David Brearton","And Alexia to jump in on the other markets; we do make money in almost all of our emerging markets. So we talked about the BRICs because they\u2019re the biggest and they have very strong gross margins and good OI margins. We also have very good gross margin, very strong OI margins in our other emerging markets. We don\u2019t talk (indiscernible) much because they\u2019re smaller, but they all have very good margins and we would not invest in any country that didn\u2019t have a very strong gross margin such that we could get good return on investment on those bets.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. And then as a follow-up, your power brands are growing much faster than your non-power brands. Does that mean that there's SKU rationalization going on in those non-power brands globally? And I was wondering if you could give us an idea of how many SKUs you have globally and where that may go to over time if that's happening? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","David Brearton","Yeah, I don't think I want to get into an SKU discussion, but you can ask about some future costs. I think it is a combination of expense on the market. There is some SKU proliferation that we're pulling back on clearly. There is simply a matter of focusing on the brands that are going to be the future of the company and spending less support on the secondary and tertiary brands. And there is just smaller brands in markets that just don't have the scale over time staying themselves. So they've been broadly for the last two or three years, sort of non-power brands have been broadly flat as kind of in the traditional trend we've been on and I would expect us \u2013 probably a realistic expectation going forward as well.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Good evening, guys. Thanks for the questions. It's been a while since you've done this, but I was hoping that maybe you could just aggregate the volume and mix for us to give us a better sense of volume trends and how big the mix headwind is?","David Brearton","No, we've stopped doing that because truthfully if I give you a classic example, it comes down to \u2013 if you change the pricing that obviously is pricing. If you start doing downsizing, then you get into very complicated volume versus mix calculation. So that's the reason we went away from it. Also gum doesn't realize. So we will continue to report vol\/mix as one number.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Okay. I wanted to circle back then to Rob Moskow's question on what's ailing gum? Irene, I think I heard you say you don't think it's a spend issue at least in terms of measured media. But when you look at the numbers, since the end of 2008, sugar confection up like 366% in measured media, chocolate up 97%, gum down 57%. How can we look at those numbers and not think that there is a spending problem or a marketing investment problem behind the category?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, I tell you, Jason, we talked about the fact two years ago when we bought the business. We felt that there was a spending problem. There is no question that Cadbury in the final moments had pulled back quite extensively on marketing support for gum and had very aggressively priced the category and that was part of the reason that we started to see some weakness fairly early on. We corrected that very early on, so that's why I feel quite comfortable with the level of spending. The issue for us is just making sure that we've got the right marketing mix within that spending. I think the issues that we've talked about; there's really four that we've been focused on. It's been about pricing and sizing both at the lower end and the upper end, particularly in markets like Southern Europe where the economies are still quite challenged and we are finding that we're getting very good consumer takeaway as we do a better job of covering the spectrum of price points within gum. So that's been a very important part of our '16 program. The second is, as I said, some of our marketing spending we were not feeling was as effective as possible. Some of the campaigns had gotten a little bit too esoteric and we've brought them back to the fundamental category benefits of breath-freshening as well as oral care and finally we're getting a good response to that. The third is more impactful displays. We have a number of examples around the world. Argentina is probably our best example where we have displays that are increasing our takeaway by 30%, 40% and we more broadly implemented those displays in a number of our key gum markets. And then last, which is probably the most significant, is the category over time got very heavily dependent on innovation to the point where a lot of the base SKUs were being replaced by some of the innovation and we were participants in this. But it turns out that some of those innovations were not carrying their weight. And so it's taken us some time to manage the category to get our customers to change their shelf sets and as I mentioned part of the reason, there is a lag between our share performance and the revenue growth is simply because it takes a while for our customers to make these shelf set changes. But really those are the four areas that we've been focused on and we are beginning to see some good traction in our key gum markets, particularly in the U.S. and in Europe.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Great, thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Hi, everyone. Thanks for the question. Could you just provide a bit more detail on the deceleration in volume trends in Latin America during the quarter? What were some of the factors? You called out Mexico in particular as having weaker vol\/mix, what were some of the factors at play there? And are there any additional markets you'd highlight where volumes softened or where you saw more pricing come through and just shift the balance during the quarter?","David Brearton","Yeah, I think \u2013 I'd start with we had very good vol\/mix in the most important market, which is Brazil and that was really the key one. I think vol\/mix declines really were driven by Argentina to some degree, which has its own economic issues and Mexico. Mexico was really \u2013 obviously, it's gum. So it's the same old thing and an increase in competition in powdered beverages, but it's really those two categories in Mexico that drove the negative vol\/mix.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hi. Good afternoon. When you think about some of the macro trends you're seeing \u2013 I know you touched on this a little bit in emerging markets versus Western Europe, there seems to be a \u2013 maybe a bit of a consensus thesis out there that emerging market's slowing a bit, Europe recovering a bit. Is it fair to say that you're seeing that as well? One interpretation of some of your numbers sequentially would suggest that it is, but I'm just curious if that's a fair analysis on a broad scope?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, Ken, I would say \u2013 that's not exactly what we are seeing. I mean I would say we are very pleased with our Western Europe trends and we really feel very good about the progress that we've made in a number of our core categories, certainly in the most troubled parts of the Euro zone, Southern Europe in particular. We're still continuing to see softness. I do want to kind of put the category slowdown in some context. When the emerging market category slowdown, they are still growing at 3 to 4 times the rate that we see in the developed markets. So yes, there has been a slowdown in a number of these markets and I cited the GDP to revenue relationship that we're seeing in the BRIC markets, for example. So there is no question we are seeing some slowdown. I talked about biscuits in China. Biscuits category in China grew last year about 18%. The first half of this year it's up only about 6%. So when I talk about slowdown that's the kind of dynamic that we're seeing. But we're still seeing the emerging markets for the most part are growing quite a bit faster than any of the developed markets. But I feel quite pleased with the performance that we've seen in a number of our developed markets. I talked about the strong U.S. biscuit performance, for example, as well as the strong underlying performance of our European business.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Good evening, everyone. ","David Brearton","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Just two quick questions. One is, how did you guys decide to actually repurchase stock and go that avenue rather than accelerate investments of cost cutting efficiencies?","David Brearton","Yeah, I think \u2013 as Irene laid out, we basically \u2013 we had our three cash priorities that we are focused on and the first was and she rightly indicated investing in the business, whether that's cost reduction, opportunities or whether it's investing in growth. As we sit here today, we believe we've funded the investments we need to deliver the numbers we put out in '13 and '14 and beyond. So that was the first step. We did look at M&A and we think we have the flexibility for that. And we always said the third step, the place we would turn to next would be returning cash to shareholders. So we did follow that sequence in looking at the opportunities and we did wait until we got our debt in line before we started those discussions. So it was a thoughtful process and it was tied really in sort of strategic planned process.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","And then my last thing, as you gain share in gum, can you talk about your profit profile change to see how that actually has changed?","David Brearton","I don't think we give profit by category and I wouldn't want to go down that road now. Gum is a highly profitable business at the gross margin line. So I think that's probably as far as I'll go.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Great, thank you very much.","David Brearton","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Co.","Good evening, everybody. Maybe I'm a little bit slow tonight. I'm just trying to figure out what all the puts and takes for the guidance are for the full year. I have on the plus side, maybe lower than expected tax rate, maybe some share repurchases, the interest expense is lower and then that is partially offset by reinvestments and currency. Am I missing anything? And is the net-net of this a positive impact on this full year guidance or does it just the amount?","David Brearton","Yeah, I think the \u2013 we have our full-year guidance at constant currency of 155 to 160, that\u2019s the same number we gave back in May. Within that taxes will be favorable for that, really have invested more behind that, interest is very small and share buyback frankly will be there, its smallest workers were doing most of that towards the end of the year. So, I think that will be the two big swing factors. Currently we call that there was a $0.05 risk on currency because the guidance we gave is a conference currency. So currency stage where they were I July 31st for the rest of the year then the number will come down born by about a nickel.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Co","Okay. Got you, and then the other question I had the pricing in Asia Pacific turn negative this quarter. What\u2019s behind that?","David Brearton","It\u2019s a question of timing of promotions and react in a competitive advantage, but having importantly, we\u2019re focused on maintaining the gross margin going forward.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Co","Okay. So that shouldn\u2019t the trend for the rest of the year? Okay. Thank you.","Operator: We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from John Bumgarner of Wells Fargo.","John Bumgarner - Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks for the question. Good afternoon.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hello, John.","John Bumgarner - Wells Fargo","I\u2019ve been wondering if you can speak a little bit to your introduction of the espresso compatible capsules over in Europe. I know you\u2019ve seen other branded competitors do that in the recent years, look out quite we\u2019ll for them then we reinvigorating the brands. So just wondering of I could speak mainly for the details for the program and maybe your thoughts on a broader opportunity to grow premium roast and ground coffee across Europe in general,","Irene Rosenfeld","Well we got to get the driver of the hour coffee performance has been or more convenient coffee forms as I had mentioned, Tassimo up about 40%, Millicano up in the very strongly in the double-digits and so that continues to be an area of focus. We did announce the launch of an espresso compatible plot. We are starting with [indiscernible] in France and Germany. As we speak we will expand that to a number of other countries in the later part of the year. So, we think this is an opportunity. And we\u2019re \u2013 we believe we have very strong brands that will perform well in that system and as all doing.","John Bumgarner - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you.

(Operator Instructions)","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay","Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Brearton, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release. This release and today's slides are available on our website mondelezinternational.com.","As you know, we will make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today\u2019s prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks, Dexter. It\u2019s easy to forget, but we just marked our one-year anniversary on October 1st. We\u2019ve accomplished a lot this past year and have taken a number of actions to sharpen our focus and straighten our capabilities. In the phase of challenging economic conditions, we delivered solid results. Strong volume mix, in fact the strongest in our industry. Accelerating growth in emerging markets in line with our double-digit target, strong market share performance in four of our five regions and double-digit adjusted EPS growth at constant currency.","We are also taking some major steps to improve margins. Cash flow and return on invested capital. As we detailed a couple of months ago, we\u2019ve identified significant supply chain savings. Together with reducing overhead, these savings underpin our margin improvement targets, including gains of 500 basis points in North America and 250 points in Europe by 2016.","We\u2019ve also authorized a $6 billion share repurchase program, and increased our quarterly dividend. In fact so far this year, we\u2019ve returned nearly $1.5 billion to our shareholders. At the same time, we\u2019ve had some challenges. Our revenue growth was solid, but it was below expectations. This is due in part to factors outside our control, like the precipitous slide in coffee prices and the slowdown in global categories. But other challenges rest squarely on our own shoulders.","As you know we\u2019ve some speed bumps in Brazil and Russia last year, just as we came out of the spin. But in the matter of months we identified the route causes and implemented effective solutions. Both Brazil and Russia have rebounded well and are now growing in the mid to high teens. However, as you read in our earnings release, like many of our peers, we\u2019re now facing some headwinds in China.","In a global enterprise, there will certainly be challenges from time-to-time. But our job and our promise to shareholders, is to manage those challenges and deliver our commitments. This needs to be a combination of more quickly adjusting expectations to marketplace realities, improving early warning systems to stay ahead of potential issues and having the right leaders and capabilities in place.","We\u2019ve addressed each of these issues. So as we look ahead, we really in optimistic about the power and the potential of our unique assets to deliver significant value to our shareholders.","With that perspective, let\u2019s look at our third quarter and year-to-date results. In Q3, organic revenue growth increased 5.3%. That\u2019s up sequentially from 3.8% at each of the first two quarters. Volume mix was very strong, driving all of the revenue growth in the quarter and the vast majority of our growth year-to-date. The strength was also broad based with volume mix of in all regions. The contribution from pricing year-to-date has been modest largely due to the impact of lower coffee prices.","Growth in emerging markets continue to improve sequentially from 9.4% in Q1 to 9.7% in Q2 and 10.7% in Q3. The BRIC markets had been the key drivers of this increase, up double-digits in the third quarter. Brazil, Russia and India each grew mid to high teens more than offsetting the weak results in China, which I will talk about in a moment.","Developed markets also improved sequentially, up 1.8% in Q3 versus performance that was essentially flat in the first half. There is no question that 5.3% revenue growth driven entirely by volume mix is strong, especially in a difficult operating environment. And we\u2019ve good underlying momentum in four of our five regions, but we missed our expectations. 5.3% is below the 6% rate we\u2019ve forecasted. And I\u2019m extremely disappointed about that.","Lower coffee pricing and weak results in China, draw the shortfall. We\u2019ve been talking about the pass through impact of lower coffee prices on our revenue growth for more than a year now. We expected the coffee pricing would be a headwind in the first half and then would stabilize, but instead coffee has continued to fall and its now trading below $1.5.","As a result, coffee was a 50 basis point drag to our growth in Q3. And with green coffee prices at this level, we expect coffee will be a similar drag in Q4 and at least for the first half of next year. Remember though in price to protect gross profit dollars, so the pass through of lower green coffee prices on our top line doesn\u2019t impact our bottom line, but it certainly affects our headline numbers.","The more significant issue this quarter was in our $1 billion China business. Its no secret that China\u2019s GDP growth has slowed from north of 9% in 2011 to about 7.5% this year. The macro slowdown is affecting consumption across most consumer goods. And our biscuit category is no exception, dropping from 18% growth in 2012 to 3% in Q1.","As we observed the short slowdown, we invested to stimulate category growth. We increased marketing and sales support behind Oreo and Chips Ahoy! We launched golden Oreo which has been highly successful in other markets. And from a share standpoint, these investments worked which shares up for both Oreo and Chips Ahoy! And the launch of golden Oreo was also successful with product placement in over 500,000 outlets in just six weeks.","So what happened? Well, our incremental investments did not stimulate sustainable category growth. After an initial increase in Q2, the biscuit category was up only 2% in Q3. Second, as we shifted spending to our power brands, our second tier brands lost more share than expected. And our trade stock targets were appropriate for double-digit growth and became excessive when the categories slowed.","We've taken a number of actions to address the situation. We're reducing and closely monitoring trade stocks while shoring up our analytical capabilities to get more and better data in real time. This will allow our newly appointed leadership to quickly address changes in the marketplace.","Looking ahead with an extensive multi-geared network of nearly 1,000 distributors, it will take some time to recalibrate trading inventories and regain biscuit momentum. So we expect biscuit revenue in China to remain soft in Q4 while progressively improving next year. ","Despite these near-term headwinds, we remain optimistic about the future of China. From 2009 to 2012 organic revenue grew 25% annually. The economy and the biscuit category will recover and our gum business continues to grow nicely in a very robust category.","Outside of China, we're also experiencing a slowdown in most of our global categories. We're still growing well in excess of other food categories but realistically it will affect our near to mid-term growth aspirations.","In aggregate, our categories last year grew approximately 6%. In fact that was the basis for our forecast last September. So far this year, however, growth has slowed to under 4%. We've offset the category slowdown somewhat with strong share performance especially behind our power brands. In aggregate we're gaining or holding share in nearly two-thirds of our revenue. Year-to-date, biscuits were up 7.5%.","In emerging markets, revenue increased 11%, despite China's weak performance. In developed markets, revenue rose 6% led by strong growth in both North America and Europe. Their performance was terrific with more than 75% of revenue in key markets gaining or holding share. Our power brands grew nearly 12% led by Oreo, belVita, Tuc, Club Social, Barni and Chips Ahoy!.","Turning to chocolate, year-to-date revenue was up more than 6%. In emerging markets, chocolate was up 14% with strong growth across all geographies. In developed markets, chocolate revenue rose 2% led by mid single digit growth in Europe; power brands little over 10% with Cadbury Dairy Milk, Lacta and Milka each up double digits.","Our share of performance through September was only about 45% with strength in emerging markets offset by share losses in some larger developed countries like the U.K. We're encouraged to see that recent U.K. share performance has recovered. It's now flat for the year through the latest tracking period ending in early October.","Turning to gum and candy, global revenue declined about 1% but we're beginning to see some signs of improvement as revenues rose modestly in Q3. That's the first increase we've seen in quite some time. Candy was up 4% through September driven by Halls. Gum in emerging markets was up 6% including strength in China and most of Africa. While gum in developed markets was down 16% year-to-date, the rate of decline slowed in Q3.","Global gum share was strong with about two-thirds of our revenue gaining or holding share. Clearly we're gaining traction in those markets where we've implemented our four-step playbook to fix gum. And as we discussed last quarter, we expect those share improvements will be a precursor to revenue gains as we implement our playbook in other markets and as customers reset their shelves.","Finally, in beverages and cheese and grocery, revenue grew about 1% with power brands up nearly 4%. As expected, coffee was down 3% as we pass through significantly lower green costs. Vol mix, however, continues to be strong contributing 8 points year-to-date. Our convenience coffee platforms continued to drive positive mix with Tassimo up nearly 40% year-to-date and Millicano sales doubling. After only about one year in the market, Millicano is nearly a $100 million business.","Coffee share performance has also been strong with about 70% of revenue in key markets gaining or holding share. So even in this more challenging environment, we've been able to deliver strong growth and share performance in most of our categories. We're clearly not immune to the stronger headwinds that will temper our growth for the balance of the year and into 2014, but we remain confident in our ability to weather the slowdown and deliver top tier performance over the long term.","Now let me turn it over to Dave.","David Brearton","Thanks, Irene. As Irene detailed earlier, weak China performance tempered our Q3 results. For Asia-Pacific region overall organic revenue growth was flat in the quarter with vol\/mix gains essentially offset by lower pricing in the developed part of the region.","While revenue was up 3% year-to-date, we expect Q4 to be down low single digits due largely to issues in China. The region's emerging markets were up mid to high single digits year-to-date tempered more recently by slower China growth.","In contrast, India was up mid teens with new capacity now on stream, our chocolate business grew more than 20% in Q3 in line with continued robust category growth. Additionally, the region's power brands grew 11%. With the notable exception of Asia-Pacific, however, our four other geographies delivered solid results in the quarter.","In Latin America, organic revenue was up about 17% in the quarter and 13% year-to-date. Despite a persistently weak economy, softening category trends and consumption declines, our business in Brazil has grown mid teens year-to-date. Incremental investments in A&C have delivered attractive returns driving strong vol\/mix and high teens growth in the rapidly growing North East region. Share performance in Brazil remains solid with particular strength in chocolate.","Outside Brazil, pricing in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina drove most of the growth. Our teams there have done a good job of responding to the challenging economic conditions, but we have a cautious outlook for these markets due to the volatility. Importantly, share performance in Latin America was strong with more than 70% of our revenues gaining or holding share. Finally, the region's power brands increased 15% led by Lacta, Club Social, Oreo, Halls and belVita.","Turning to EEMEA, organic revenue grew 13% in the quarter and nearly 10% year-to-date. Strong vol\/mix gains of 16 percentage points in the quarter and 12 points through September drove the region's growth, while coffee and chocolate pricing in Russia accounted for the bulk of the pricing decline. Once again, Russia's performance was exceptional, up nearly 20% in the quarter due to very strong vol\/mix growth as well as a favorable year-ago comparison.","Other markets including Ukraine, the GCC countries, South Africa and West Africa also posted strong growth in the quarter. Year-to-date share performance across the region was solid with more than 60% of revenues gaining or holding share. Overall, the region's power brands were up 14%.","Looking to Europe, revenues increased nearly 2% in the quarter and 0.7% year-to-date, despite the continued economic challenges in the regions. In Q3, vol\/mix was a gain up sharply contributing 4.7 percentage points to growth. As we mentioned earlier, coffee pricing remains a significant drag on the top line. Lower coffee revenue reduced Europe's overall growth by 1.4 percentage points in the third quarter and 1.7 points year-to-date.","Looking at performance by category, chocolate revenue was up mid to single digits year-to-date driven almost entirely by vol\/mix. Milka and Cadbury Daily Milk each delivered strong growth, while innovations like Marvellous Creations also made a meaningful contribution. Biscuits were up mid single digits with most coming from vol\/mix. Oreo, belVita and our Choco-Bakery platform drove much of that growth.","Coffee declined mid-single digits due to lower pricing more than offsetting solid vol\/mix, but our convenient coffee platforms continue to grow strongly. Gum and candy revenues were down mid-to-high single digits mostly due to gum. Q2, we\u2019re beginning to see some improvement in share performance as we implement our new Playbook. Overall the recent power brands were up 4% year-to-date.","In North America, organic revenue increased 2.4% at the same rate as the first half. U.S. biscuit\u2019s continue to perform well with revenues up at least 5% for the ninth consecutive quarter. Most of this growth was due to vol\/mix, behind strong execution by our direct store delivery sales force. Oreo was up double digits in the quarter and year-to-date on the strength of base SKUs as well as innovation such as Birthday Cake and Mega Stuff. U.S. biscuits continued to gain market share as well up a 100 basis points in Q3, and 110 points year-to-date. Candy once again delivered solid growth behind Halls.","As Irene mentioned, U.S. gum share rose for the second consecutive quarter with especially strong share gains in convenient stores. Gum revenue though declined as anticipated as our customers continue to reset the shelf assortments to reflect faster moving [indiscernible]. We\u2019re also lapping a high quarter through a year-ago in preparation for the spin-offs. We expect revenue trends to improve beginning in Q4.","Turning to profits, adjust gross margin declined 50 basis points in the quarter and was down modestly year-to-date. In the third quarter, higher commodity cost more than offset benefits from strong vol\/mix and net productivity. In fact, net productivity accelerated to more than 3% of cost of goods sold in the quarter, about double the rate of the first half. However the lag in implementing pricing to recover higher commodity costs and currency impacts offset the benefit from strong net productivity. Going forward, pricing actions are expected to fully offset commodity and currency movements allowing net productivity benefits to flow through to margin.","Adjusted operating income margin in the third quarter was 12.2% consistent with our guidance of sequential improvement each quarter. As expected margin declined year-over-year, that\u2019s because last years Q3 margin was unusually high due to the Spin-off of Kraft Foods Group and some prior-year one time items. Year-to-date adjusted OI margin was 11.3% down 140 basis points versus the prior-year reflecting various factors including about 30 basis points from the valuation of Venezuelan currency about 50 points from cycling of prior-year one time items, and about 50 points from incremental investments in emerging markets.","We continue to expect adjusted OI margin will be about 13% in Q4 and about 12% for the full-year in line with our previous communications. The sequential improvement in margin reflects a greater contribution from net productivity and continued focus on overheads. In fact overhead costs as a percentage of net revenue were down more than 50 basis points from the third quarter led by significant overhead reductions in Europe. As we said before we expect to see greater overhead leverage in the fourth quarter since absolute revenues typically 10% to 15% higher than in other quarters.","Turning now to earnings per share; adjusted EPS for the third quarter was $0.41 including a negative $0.01 in tax from currency. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS was up 16.7% driven by lower taxes. For the first nine months adjusted EPS was $1.12 including a negative $0.07 impact from currency. On a constant currency basis adjusted EPS increased 15.5% again driven by lower taxes. Incremental investments in emerging markets were a key driver the $0.03 decline in operating earnings.","Lastly our cash flow continues to be on track. Comparisons are difficult because the year ago period is pre-spin and included North American growth rate, but the cash conversion cycle outside North America has improved more than 10 days this year versus the same period a year ago. Our year-to-date cash flow is in line with prior experience and our expectations for the full-year.","Turning to guidance, we are lowering our 2013 revenue guidance to approximately 4% down from the low end of 5% to 7%. That means our growth in Q4 will be only about 3%. This is much lower than we were expecting, but it again reflects the impact of lower coffee prices, slower global category growth and a Q4 revenue decline in Asia Pacific largely due to China. Taken together these factors will temper growth by 2 to 3 percentage points in Q4.","Importantly we expect the solid underlying momentum in our other four regions to continue. And as I mentioned the slight to slower revenue through a combination of increased net productivity and overhead management we still expect to hit our adjusted OI margin of approximately 12% for the full-year. In addition, we are raising our 2013 EPS target range by $0.02 to $1.57 to $1.62 to reflect the flow through of some tax favorability. This range is based on guidance currency rates.","Looking ahead, our long-term goals remain the same, including 5% to 7% organic revenue growth, operating margin of 14% to 16%, double digit EPS growth and strong cash flow to invest in our future and return capital to shareholders. That said, when we laid our long-term revenue growth target over a year ago, our categories were growing about 6%. As we\u2019ve discussed our categories have slowed this year to below 4%. Well we believe that the industry wide slowdown is temporary we don\u2019t expect categories to accelerate in the near term.","Although we won't provide definitive 2014 guidance until February we wanted to let you know how we currently see next year playing out. We expect the slower category growth and lower coffee pricing will continue to pressure our top line. As a result we believe our revenue growth next year will be more in the 4% to 5% range. Nonetheless, we expect to leverage our advantage brands to continue to drive strong share performance. And even in the phase of slower growth environment we believe we have the financial and operating leverage to deliver strong adjusted OI growth and margin expansion while the benefits from our share repurchase program should help mitigate some of the tax headwinds on EPS.","We\u2019re also exploring additional opportunities to accelerate cost reduction efforts both throughout our supply chain and in overheads. Of course while we take significant steps towards our long-term margin goals we\u2019re continuing to prudently make foundational investments to strengthen our sales and route to market capabilities especially in emerging markets. In addition, we\u2019ll be flexible in how we deploy AMC investments is to balance affordability, opportunity and ensure attractive returns. As a result we expect to not only weather this slower growth environment, but also be well positioned when these markets accelerate once again.","So to wrap up, through the first nine months this year we delivered solid results including strong vol\/mix gains, 10% growth in emerging markets and increased market shares. At the same time we continue to face headwinds from slower global category growth, lower coffee pricing and weak China sales causing us to reduce our full-year 2013 revenue outlook. Although these factors will continue to pressure top line in 2014, we believe we have the plans and place to deliver strong operating income growth and make significant progress towards our long-term margin goals.","Now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good afternoon everybody.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just two questions, one to Dave; just looking at how you\u2019ve preliminarily laid out 2014, I think previously you had talked about a margin goal for 2014 at being high 12\u2019s and assuming that also was with a higher organic revenue growth. So, should we still be thinking about that high 12\u2019s margin for next year or is that still, is that somewhat in [ph] flux?","David Brearton","Well, we\u2019re not officially giving 2014 guidance. But as I said a minute ago, I think we\u2019re pretty confident that we have the productivity and overhead programs in place that we should be able to stick to the margin guidance we gave before.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just second question. Irene, you spent some time talking to investors over the last couple of months and there have certainly been a lot of discussion, debate about I guess the balance between spending in emerging markets, what the right growth rates are, pacing of cost savings. So could you just talk a bit about your experience with that? And albeit your lowering organic growth for next year, just sort of how you feel about those investments and the opportunities and if anything has changed in your mind in terms of what the opportunities are?","Irene Rosenfeld","I think the meetings that we had with our investors were very productive and they gave us a lot of insight in terms of how they're thinking about their business and it gave us an opportunity to talk about how we see the business. If I step back, I think there were about maybe five takeaways. I think first and foremost, there was universal agreements among all of our investors that we have created a very advantaged portfolio that's got an incredible collection of grants in very fast growing categories with the nice emerging markets footprint. I think that was a fairly universal sentiment. There is no question, I'd say second, all investors believe that we have significant margin upside as we do and we've laid out very aggressive plans as you have seen particularly in our developed markets in North America. As you know we set a goal of 500 basis point improvement over the next three years which should get us to peer averages and similarly in Europe we set a goal of about 250 basis points improvement and that also will bring us actually to the high end of our peers in Europe. We did at the same time go \u2013 many investors tell us that they want to make sure that we continue to invest in emerging markets. They all see the same opportunities there that we do and the question really is just to make sure we are continuing to make those foundational investments but we're doing it prudently and at the appropriate pace relative to market conditions to make sure that we are getting a good return. I think the third point that you referenced is that a number of investors told us that they thought that our top line targets might be too aggressive especially in the current environment as we have seen our categories slowing. And we agree that when we set the targets back in September it was predicated on our categories growing about 6%. And so we set a top line target of 5% to 7%. That was a reasonable expectation. The reality is as we have shown you, those categories have slowed from 6% last year to 5% in the first half and now to less than 4% and so we clearly have to accommodate that and thinking about what our targets are and I believe we have done that as we've given you the outlook as we think about 2014. Fourth, I think there is certainly some frustration about our ability to deliver expectations. And I'll say again, we got operations in nearly 80 countries including some very volatile emerging markets. We're clearly going to have challenges from time to time and we're not going to always deliver things in a straight line. But as we did Brazil and Russia and now with China, we will get on it, we'll fix it and we'll make it better. The key though is to make sure that we have the right targets out there so that we're able to make the appropriate tradeoffs. And without a doubt I think all investors recognize that our fundamental business is really quite healthy and I think you see that again today in the results that we've reported. And finally I'd say we got very universal support and gratitude for our $6 billion share repurchase program. That was quite well received. So I think it was a very productive set of meetings. I think we learned a lot and I think it was a good opportunity for us to continue to talk about how we see the future and why we are as confident about where things are going as we are.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks for the insights, Irene.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Good afternoon.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Irene, you talked a little bit about the need to improve upon some of the early warning capabilities that you have in some of these more volatile emerging markets. I know that last year following kind of the issues you saw in Brazil and Russia, I think that you talked about some of this back then, just remember that wasn't seen as early as maybe you would have liked. So I guess I was hopeful that we wouldn't see something come a little bit out of a blue in a big emerging market again. China, it seems like was not something that at least you were talking about or more recently whether it be on the second quarter call or in presentations you've done since then. So I'm trying to get a sense. Did I also kind of come out of a blue where you didn't have enough early warning and it's not why following Brazil and Russia, why weren't there better, I guess, controls from that perspective on China?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, let me answer that question in two parts, Andrew. Without a doubt as I've mentioned, we've taken a number of steps as we continue to evolve our thinking and our learning with the portfolio as it now exists. We went from a company that was almost entirely in developed markets to a one that has a very significant emerging market footprint. And as we've said, these markets have different characteristics than some of our more mature markets. In the case of China as we saw the biscuit category slowing, as I mentioned, we could see it was going from plus 18 last year to plus 3 in the first quarter and we took a number of steps to try to address the slowdown. And frankly in the second quarter, we actually saw some results. We saw second quarter the biscuit business was up 9.5% and for July frankly it was up about 4%. So we were feeling pretty good that we were able to offset that. We had very strong share performance in a number of our categories and so we really felt pretty comfortable that it could be offset. In the speed with which that plus 9.5 in Q2 became plus 2 in Q3 was really the issue that we're wrestling with. And again, the good news is we know it, we took actions, we saw it and took actions starting in August to start to pull back a little bit. But as I said in my remarks, when you have inventory plans to be at a double digit growth rate, to support double digit growth rate and it plummet down to plus 2, it just leaves us in a difficult situation. We've got over a 1,000 distributors in China and there's a fair amount of inventory in each level of this system and that's why it's just going to take us a little bit of time to clean it up. But net-net, we understood that the category has slowed. We thought we had some actions that would help to stem that and to offset that and they simply didn't work as well as we had thought. I mean more broadly as I've said before, we have a number of new processes in place. We've created dashboards for all of our key businesses that leverages our SAP instance and allows us to give our local leaders and us at headquarters the right data to be able to see the business in real time. So for example, we're now able to see dairy sales in China which is a critical piece in our ability to continue to monitor how things are doing. We have much better inventory visibility in our distribution networks. We are continuing to train our leaders. For some of them, this is the first time these categories have slowed down on their watch. And so they're learning how to plan a little bit more in a more disciplined way. They're now doing 12 month rolling forecast which allows us to have better visibility outage of the future. We're doing marketing ROI analyses much more frequently in China, for example, we used to look at marketing ROI once a year. In the United States and in Europe that's a fine idea before it doesn't change. In an exclusively growing market like China, it changes quite rapidly and so our ability to get that feedback quickly and make sure that we're getting good returns for our marketing investments is really essential to us. We are helping to develop capabilities and strategic pricing in so many of these emerging markets, coinage, price size architecture is the name of the name particularly as we go into these traditional trade outlets. And so we're doing a lot of work to make sure that our leaders have that capability and that our factories have that ability to make products that can deliver on those price points. And we've done a lot of work in a number of our markets on what we call perfect store, which is just making sure that the point of buying expectation is as good as the marketing programming. And for example in markets like Russia, we used to have what we call a strike rate which is how many times you get an order for your visit of about 30%. It's now us close to 80% and we've got much better compliance to make sure that the right items are in distribution. So we've taken a number of steps to improve the processes, the capabilities and in a couple of cases, we've made some leadership changes to make sure that we got the right managers in place. Clearly the leaders that took a business from 50 million to 500 million may not be the same leaders that take it from 500 million to 5 billion. And so slowly but surely we're making sure that we have in each of our team growth markets, we have the right leadership to accomplish that. So net-net we\u2019ve taken a number of steps and that\u2019s why I feel increasingly more comfortable that, that we will be able to continue to monitor this and we\u2019ve the early warning capabilities in place. But I said in China we took a number of actions to try to address that situation and they just didn\u2019t work the way we\u2019ve had hoped.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Got it. Well, thank you for all that detail. That\u2019s helpful. And just one quick one, in the global category slowdown that you\u2019ve talked about from 6.3 to 3.8 year-to-date, just was there -- was the primary change in that volume or price or is it a mix of both?","David Brearton","It\u2019s a mix of both Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Okay.","David Brearton","And it\u2019s fairly broad. It actually goes across all the regions. It\u2019s not just emerging markets, but obviously pricing when it relates to coffee and a number of the other commodities have been fairly stable, but the vol mix portion of it has also been slow.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","I just have a question for you, first of all on the China business. You\u2019ve had mentioned that, that was a factor in your -- obviously in this quarter was the reduction in your growth rate and revenue for that -- for the Asia Pacific region. It looks like its going to bounce right back though in Q4. And if heard you correctly Dave, you said it was going to -- it was actually going to be a drag on fourth quarter revenue for the Asia Pacific region. But in the slides it indicated it was going to be up nicely in the fourth quarter. So shall we put those two statements together if I could?","David Brearton","Yes, I think -- no, it\u2019s not going to bounce back in Q4. In fact our Asia Pacific region will be down low single digits in Q4, mostly driven by China and it will be biscuits and mostly inventory. So we started taking inventory out of the system really in September when we saw what was coming through in the market and share data, that\u2019s kind of playing its way through and because there is up to four different levels of distributors to get through before you get to the consumer in some parts of China is going to take us through the end of the year to do that. So it\u2019s a double-digit decline in China this quarter. Its going to be a double-digit decline again in quarter four and that\u2019s the biggest part of the reason why we\u2019ve called our quarter four down.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","Okay. And then just a question for you, as you look ahead and you have a little more modest revenue growth for 2014, is it just the persistence of [ph] weak out or slower category growth as you expect. I think you\u2019ve said, you still expect to gain share. Is it just that basis for the softer revenue growth in 2014, do you expect?","David Brearton","Yes, I think the -- what we\u2019ve done as we said, given that the global categories are growing slightly under 4% today. We felt it was prudent to give you an eye to how we\u2019re kind of thinking about going forward next year. And the guidance we\u2019ve given a 4% to 5% is assuming we will continue to drive for share growth similar to what we\u2019ve done this year, we will drive for share growth everywhere. That will be one of two things. It will either drive upside versus the guidance we\u2019ve given or if we have a disruption somewhere or an unexpected events in a place like Egypt or Venezuela, it will help drive an offset. So I think by giving you guidance that\u2019s more or less in line with the category growth as we see it today. I think it gives us room, so hopefully have upside, but at worst at least be able to offset the unexpected.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","Okay. And then, do you have a recommended tax rate then for the year now, where you would expect the tax rate to come in?","David Brearton","Yes, I think it\u2019s obviously very low year-to-date, about 5%. I think its in line pretty much with what we\u2019ve said last time about 10% to 13%, may be a little bit lower, but in the kind of the 10% to 13% range. Quarter four, I\u2019d expect our cash rate to be in line with what we\u2019ve said it will be over the next three to five years, its kind of 20% plus or minus a couple of points.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","Okay.","David Brearton","I think we\u2019re not expecting any big discrete events in quarter four.","Christopher Growe - Stifel Nicolaus & Co.","Okay. That sounds great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Good evening, everyone.","David Brearton","Hi, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Just a thing about big picture question, do you think Mondelez should operate in all 80 countries or is there some non-core regions that might be worth loss to retrench from a reallocate your time and capital to other more core regions?","Irene Rosenfeld","No, I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good job Ken of focusing on the countries that matter most and it starts with the BRIC countries and yes that\u2019s the biggest piece to date of our merge up, the 40% of revenue that comes from the emerging market. We\u2019ve begun to invest in what we\u2019ve talked about is our next weight markets, which are primarily the Middle East and Africa. But beyond that we\u2019re not planting flags in lots of different countries. I made the point simply to give you a sense that there is always going to be something happening, it is our job however to manage that reality and to ensure that the guidance that we\u2019re giving to you -- that we can deliver the guidance we\u2019re giving to you.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","My second question, you talk a lot about the North America and European market opportunities. Can you talk about the opportunity to restore Latin American margins, the mid teen levels? I know this year -- your sales growth has been good, your margins have come in, just is there what opportunities do you have to actually reestablish the Latin American margins back to more historical levels?","David Brearton","Yes, I think historical levels they\u2019re relatively high last year because we\u2019ve a number of one-time items last year, we had insurance proceeds, we have some asset sales. So the Latin American margins last year, we\u2019re actually were unusually high. Having said that, I\u2019d say that year-to-date they haven\u2019t been the greatest because as I\u2019ve talked on the call, on the gross margin line our gross margins were down. Part of that is it\u2019s fairly common across the emerging markets, but as currencies have devalued, the cost of imported raw and packaging materials into those countries goes up and a lot of these markets is very difficult to hedge that. So it is the P&L almost immediately and there is a lag between that and when the pricing goes. So I think you will see the pricing come through, you will see the gross margins improve, not specifically in Latin America, I think it will be across all the emerging markets as we go forward into next year.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Great. And what interest expense should we use for the year? And that\u2019s my last question. Thank you.","David Brearton","I think the -- we\u2019ve a coupon rate of about 6% right now, but the interest expense on the P&L was down around 5.3% in the quarter, which is probably as good a rate as any right now and the reason for the gap between the coupon and the 5.3% is because as we\u2019ve been paying off debt we\u2019ve put more of our debt into commercial paper and short-term obviously those cost less. So it\u2019s about 5.3% in the quarter, that\u2019s probably a reasonable number for the year.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good evening.","David Brearton","Good evening, Eric.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Quick one and I don\u2019t know if you said it, but your guidance on tax rate for 2014 \u2026","David Brearton","We haven\u2019t given the guidance for \u201914.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","\u2026and that seems to be a big hurdle, right?","David Brearton","It\u2019s probably going to be a big hurdle. We haven\u2019t given guidance for \u201914. What we\u2019ve said in the past is that this year is unusually low from the next three to five years after this we would expect our tax rate to be 20% plus or minus a couple of points. And eventually over the very long-term it will probably go up to the 25% range. But I think for the next three to five years, its going to be 20 plus or minus couple of points. We haven\u2019t given anything specific to 2014.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then second question, a lot of companies have been talking about India actually slowing down and you posted very good results there. Does some of your lower revenue guidance outlook assume that India slows just -- kind of aside from the China issue?","Irene Rosenfeld","No actually we\u2019ve high hopes for India. In fact the challenge -- our challenge is that our growth in India has been constrained as you know because we were out of chocolate capacity. We\u2019re now putting that capacity on stream and we should continue to see growth in line with the categories which has been growing in the high double-digit rate. So our outlook on India, it remains quite bullish and I think we\u2019ve the programs in place. We made some significant investments in relative market as well as capacity. We\u2019re just starting up a Greenfield. And we\u2019re just -- we just broke ground on the Greenfield and so anyway our outlook is quite bullish.","David Brearton","The (indiscernible) and chocolate are still up well over 20%. So that chocolate is growing well, there are some other categories that for us is not -- are not nearly as important in India that are slowing down, but chocolate continues to be really robust.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then, I mean, if I could ask you just the last like a more philosophical longer term question. The emerging market investments I think on the slides that you gave over the summer, although I don\u2019t have them in front of me, because I\u2019m on the road, but in \u201914 you were going to lower those EM investments to 10 basis points from this year, which were 50 to 70. But it seems like -- in the kind of the race for market share out there and when you look at some of the very successful companies that have -- whether private or public, like Wrigley or a Coke or other names when EM markets have slowdown, that\u2019s kind of when those companies have put their pedal to the metal and that\u2019s when they\u2019ve really pushed. And so why wouldn\u2019t you -- even though you\u2019ve got pressure from all kinds of sources these days, why wouldn\u2019t you take the opportunity as a slower EM to actually really invest heavily and try to gain share and so if the categories do come back, you're that much \u2013 you have that much more land underneath your feet.","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes. So we agree absolutely with your premise, Eric. As you know we accelerated some of our investments in emerging markets this year and we feel very good about the return that we've gotten particularly in markets like Brazil and Russia and India. So we will continue to do that. And because we had accelerated those investments, what we said was we didn't see the need to invest again next year incrementally, and so for that reason that's the 10 bps that you remember. So we just said we made the investments this year and in fact that's playing through in our margins and you'll see that we don't need to invest incrementally we don't believe next year while we play through and ensure that we get a good return on the sales capability and route to market investments that we made this year. We believe very strongly as you do that the opportunity to invest prudently in these markets is the time is now and we will continue to do that.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thank you. When I visited your team out in China, again I guess I would echo what Andrew Lazar said is that the message again there was that yes, the category had slowed for biscuits but Mondelez expected to outgrow its category, maybe just at that point you just had to keep with the corporate line but it does raise the question about these early warning systems and how much your management team was communicating internally. That's more of a statement. But I was impressed by what I saw from the infrastructure in China and I thought that you were kind of thinking of launching chocolate in China because you had a very good hot zone distribution capability building up with gum and it seemed to be setting the stage. Does your experience this year slow that down in terms of the timing of when you might launch chocolate?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, as you might imagine, Rob, we're not going to be talking about any things that we haven't launched. We launched them. So currently there are many wide spaced opportunities and we will pick them one at a time as we feel that the organization is ready to handle them. And at this moment I feel that the act of making sure that we get the biscuit momentum back together to continue to fuel the momentum on gum which we just launched a year ago should be and is the main focus of our China team and that's what they're doing. But there will be continued wide spaced launches over time and as we do them, we'll tell you what we've done.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Can I ask a follow-up on gum in China? I imagine it was negative in the quarter. When do you expect gum to turn positive in China, Irene?","Irene Rosenfeld","Gum in China has been a phenomenal success. It's actually almost about a $100 million business in about a year. So we're feeling quite comfortable with the progress on gum in China. All that hot zone activity that you saw is a key driver of that success. The gum category in China is growing mid double digit rates and that is one of the reasons we launched there. And so we feel quite good about the performance there and frankly gum in all of our emerging markets continues to grow for the most part. The issue, as you know, has been in our developed markets and the good news is we're starting to see some good traction on share improvements as we've put our playbook in place.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","So despite the tough comp to Stride year-ago launch in third quarter, you were still up versus that tough comp a year ago?","Irene Rosenfeld","That's correct.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good evening, everyone. In developed markets you've talked about supply chain, cost reduction opportunities on both the manufacturing side and also in terms of removing some of the SKU complexity from the business. And I understand what the hurdles are, the uncertainty around timing and addressing some of the less efficient manufacturing capacities, but if you wanted to more aggressively go after margin improvement in North America and in Europe, is there any opportunity to accelerate the portfolio simplification aspect of the plan?","David Brearton","Yes. The plan we've laid out so far is 500 basis points of margin improvement in North America and as you've talked about the supply chain is a key part of that. And we've started construction of the plants in Mexico. That's a key part of it. I think simplifying the portfolio is a key part of that. We've already accelerated by about a year the speed of which we'll get the 500 basis points. We'd originally said it would take us to 2017. We've now brought it back to 2016. The 500 basis points through is programs we have in our sites, we have milestones and action plans and accountabilities against that. We know how to do it. If there's ways to accelerate beyond that, we're continuing to look at those and obviously we'll pursue those. So what we've given is a 500 margin point objective is what we know we can achieve and it is based on some of the stuff we've talked to you earlier. We're clearly happy to accelerate. We've already launched it. If we could do it again, we would. If we can go further, we would. And we'll continue to look for those types of opportunities.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks, Dave. And Irene, I just wanted to get your thoughts on category growth dynamics for biscuits within the U.S. Obviously Mondelez has continued to do extremely well but I think we're starting to see the categories themselves flow a bit along with the rest of the center of store. Do you see sort of low single digit growth in those categories as the new normal for a while or have you observed anything in terms of the phasing of innovation or merchandizing across the competitive sets that you think is weighing on the category growth?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, that category growth actually is quite solid relative to many other categories in North America and in the U.S. and I've been very pleased with the share performance that our team has delivered and we see continued opportunity as we leverage the strength of our brands and we leverage the strong DSD selling organization that we have. We see continued opportunity to pick up share, so that's been a business that's growing. Our biscuit business in the U.S. has grown over 5% for almost \u2013 I think it was the ninth quarter that it's grown over 5% and we feel quite good about the outlook there. So the category has been kind of a [indiscernible] in the mid single digit range but we've been able to grow in excess of that as a result of our strong brands and our strong programming and our strong execution.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you again.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Good evening, everyone.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Can I ask another question on the margin trajectory not just in North America but you've obviously got some quite big goals in place for margin expansion over the next few years? As you think of the levers that are really going to get you from here to there, could you tell us a bit more about what the biggest ones are? Is it mostly cost saving? Are you looking at cost of goods sold or input cost moderating a bit from here? Is that positive mix from innovation worked in? Could you just give us some flavor of what's really going to \u2013 which are going to be the drivers that will really help you out there? Thank you.","David Brearton","I guess I'll start with on the commodity in Forex side, we're really only looking to price to recover commodity in Forex. We won't be looking to increase margins as part of our strategy to get there. If there's opportunities clearly we'll take those, but our assumption is we price to recover commodity in Forex so that's kind of a wash. It's really driven by a combination of mix, as you say, things like convenient coffee have higher margins, the power brands have higher margins so we'll continue to drive that and we can control that. Overheads have been the biggest source of our margin improvement over the last three years. We've driven about a 3 point margin improvement between 2009, 2012 that was entirely driven by overheads. And I think overheads just by virtue of how quickly you can undo those versus the supply chain programs will continue to be a key driver of our margin progress through 2014 and into '15. And on the third piece is the supply chain savings and that's the program Daniel Myers talked about at the Back-to-School Conference and we have a pretty comprehensive plan on what is our long-term vision and how do we stage ourselves towards that in both Europe and North America. That's the key part of getting there as well, and so I remind you the biggest gap between our margins and our peers' margins isn't gross margin, it is actually in overheads. Overheads is always an opportunity. We'll continue to drive overheads and particularly given our size, we think there's more opportunity there and we'll go after that. But the gap versus our peers is really in gross margin and that's what Daniel talked about in September. So it's everything you mentioned frankly with the exception of price and pricing is really just to cover commodities in Forex.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hi. Can you hear me?","David Brearton","Yes, Ken.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Irene, I\u2019m hearing a theme today that the breadth and complexity of the business sometimes either makes it harder to turn a problem around or perhaps add some execution challenges at times -- our times. But I guess the reason for the split up was to minimize some of that complexity. So is it still a bit of a problem, at what point does it perhaps indicate you\u2019re considering making things even simpler, and I\u2019m thinking specifically whether you might more strongly consider divesting your coffee and grocery businesses now which in fact you\u2019re holding back your top line anyway at this point.","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, look I\u2019m not going to comment on portfolio actions. Well, I want to clarify my comment about the fact that we are in 80 countries. It was simply to make a point that there\u2019s always thing\u2019s; there\u2019s different things going on. As I said though it's our job to manage that and particularly as emerging markets become and are a bigger pipe of our portfolio they\u2019re volatile. They don\u2019t always deliver their results in a straight line. Egypt went from growing 29% in the second quarter to minus 3% in the third quarter. And so we just need to have a robust enough target to make sure that we can accommodate that. And again that\u2019s why we gave you our perspective as we look forward, because our categories continue to grow in excess of other food categories, but they are growing at a slower rate. So, this is not about complexity. It is about the fact that it's a robust step of countries and categories. As a result of the split as you point out, it's quite focused and we feel quite comfortable that we have the tools in place to be able to manage that complexity. But it is a different set of countries that are driving our performance today than used to be driving our performance as Kraft Foods and we need to accommodate that and that\u2019s what I have talked about.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","And then quickly in coffee, why does your EBITDA not benefit from lower costs. I mean, Smucker\u2019s does for example, maybe the answer is that Europe is different than the U.S. but I thought we might pass that to your customers less than a 100% of your deflation.","David Brearton","No, I think it's -- yes it is different than the U.S. and there is a different dynamic there. In most of Europe there are many competitors in every country all of which were to keep the market fairly disciplined. We don\u2019t tend to loose margin on the way up. We don\u2019t tend to gain margin on the way down. It does tend to be a pass through both directions. And our customers keep us on it and our competitors keep us on it, and that\u2019s just a dynamic in Europe. I\u2019ll admit, when I started in Europe 20 years ago it was different. It was actually very much like the U.S. market, but it's a fairly competitive market place. So it's doesn\u2019t, it's not a -- you don\u2019t get windfall profits up or down; you tend to pass it through and manage the margin at a fairly constant dollar level.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","Great, thank you. Good evening.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi, David.","David Brearton","Hi, David.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","Two little tiny ones and then unfortunately a China question. The two little tiny ones, inflation in the quarter what was -- it's just gross inflation in the quarter and what do you expect it to be for the year, and then the same thing for productivity. I think you said productivity in the quarter was 3.5 points. What's the productivity on the year?","David Brearton","Yes, I think on the productivity we said it was about 3% net. It was actually about double that on a gross level. So it's certainly the highest we have done. We had said that on the year we would actually expect the average for the year to be in sort of the 2.3%, 2.5% range is kind of what we said in September, because the first half is only about 1.5%, so that\u2019s productivity. Inflation, obviously it varies dramatically from the 40%, 50% in places Venezuela through virtually none in Europe. But I guess on average it's probably in the 3% to 5%, but I\u2019ll be honest, I don\u2019t add that up in a very frequent basis.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","Okay, because it's a strange mix of commodity coffee in Europe and then the inflation of Hershey\u2019s in South America.","David Brearton","Yes, and it currently has a huge impact.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","All right. I appreciate the complexity there. On China, GDP growth in the second quarter and the third quarter had been relatively consistent for the country and I think 7.5% and 7.8%, gum is growing terrific mid double digits, I think it's what you said Irene. So none of these facts seem to help understand kind of why the China biscuit category slowed to just 2%. So really, if I just try to get it's a little bit more what the consumer insight as to why is there a Chinese gifting issue? Sometimes we hear about the quirks [ph] on gifting? And then maybe bigger picture really trying to pull insight as to why it slowed down. I got to believe that that's what's driving your comments being that the China business, the biscuit operations will continue to be slow into 2014, but I'd really just like to understand a little bit more as to the consumer insight?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes, well, I mean the GDP facts are correct and that's why we really did expect it that we could see the recovery. It is a reality that we have seen the key gifting occasions underperform relative to the year-ago comps. So we saw a slow Chinese New Year, we saw a slow autumn festival and so there's no question that some of the government policies are impacting gifting in particular, and biscuits is a big gifting item as you've said. So there is no question that there is some impact that these government policies is having on our business. And our job here is to figure out, therefore, how do we overcome that? And we're taking a number of steps to improve our pricing in sizing, we're looking at opportunities to make sure that our impacted point of buying is where we need it to be. So there's a number of actions that we're taking that we believe can help to offset it and will get the momentum back. But in the short term the fact is we've got more inventory out there as a result of the fairly precipitous slowdown in our biscuit category and we just need some time to work that through and that will probably take us through the end of the year.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Research","I really appreciate the comments. Thank you.","Dexter Congbalay","All right. Thank you very much. We are out of time right now. Nick and I will be here to answer any questions later this evening and of course through the rest of the week. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

The basis of this presentation is consistent with the adjusted pro forma results in our Form 8-K filed on October 5, 2012. And it facilitates comparisons of the company's current and future operating performance. I'd also like to note that our Q4 reported results will show Mondelez International on a stand-alone basis.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene B. Rosenfeld","Thanks, Dexter, and good afternoon. Let me start by saying it's great to be here in our new headquarters and to see the energy and optimism of our team as we begin our journey together as a new global snacks company. Year-to-date, we delivered solid performance. Organic net revenue increased 4.6%, and operating income rose more than 9% on a constant currency basis.","In the third quarter, as we expected, our revenue growth slowed, increasing only 1.5%. This was due to 3 factors: First, we were up against some tough comparisons. Indeed, we delivered exceptionally strong growth in the third quarter last year, when organic revenue was up nearly 9.5%. Second, pricing contributed less this quarter. Much of this was due to passing through the impact of lower Green Coffee costs. Arabica, for example, has dropped by nearly 1\/3 in the past 12 months. We're also beginning to lap some of the significant price increases we took last year.","And finally, we had some short-term executional issues in a few key markets like Brazil and Russia. We've already taken actions to address these missteps, such that their impact will be largely confined to the third quarter. As a result, we expect organic revenue growth to rebound to mid-single-digit levels in the fourth quarter.","But despite the slower Q3 growth, I'm confident that we'll have a strong finish to the year, and that we'll be on track to deliver the 2013 guidance that we provided in September. We're continuing to invest heavily in our power brands, and they're responding well, with strong growth in each region.","We're expanding our successful global innovation platforms, including bubbly aerated chocolates, our chocobakery line, belVita breakfast biscuits and teen gum brands like Stride ID in North America and Twist in Europe.","Revenue growth in our 2 largest categories, Biscuits and Chocolate, continues to be strong, increasing mid- to high-single digits. And Gum & Candy revenue growth, while still challenged, should increase modestly next year. Let's take a closer look at each of our global categories, starting with Biscuits.","Our Biscuits revenue is up 7%, with strong growth in both developed and Developing Markets. That's in line with the 7% increase for the category. In North America, Biscuits increased mid-single digits, and Europe is also posting solid growth. In Developing Markets, Biscuits grew low-double digits, led by China, Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Our Biscuits power brands rose 13% year-to-date, with Oreo continuing to grow in the mid-teens. Our belVita innovation platform has been another star, up more than 45% this year as we expand across markets in Europe and the Americas. In fact, belVita is on track to exceed $300 million in revenue this year.","Global Chocolate revenue increased 6% year-to-date, about the same rate as the category. In Developed Markets, Chocolate grew mid-single digits behind successful innovation like our snacks, small bites platform and activities around the London Olympics. In Developing Markets, continued strength in India and Brazil drove growth of mid- to high-single digits. Our Chocolate power brands have increased 10% this year. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Lacta had each posted strong growth.","Gum & Candy remains below our expectations. Revenues were down 1% despite the category growing about 4%. Candy delivered solid performance with Halls up low-single digits behind new marketing campaigns, and Eclairs up 20%, driven by strong growth in China, South Africa and India. But the key challenge remains Gum, especially Trident, whose revenue declined low-single digits. Although the brand grew in Developing Markets, it was more than offset by weakness in developed markets.","To be frank, Gum has been disappointing for quite some time, and it's taking us longer to change the trajectory than we anticipated. We have, however, taken a number of steps to fix our performance, and we expect to see gradual improvement over the next year.","In sum, our year-to-date results are solid, but our third quarter top line was disappointing. I want to assure you that the factors that affected us in the quarter are temporary. They're within our control and will largely be resolved by the end of the year. As a result, we fully expect our revenue growth in Q4 to rebound and to set the stage for a strong 2013.","Now let me turn it over to Dave to discuss our third quarter in more detail.","David A. Brearton","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As you can see, we delivered modest organic net revenue growth of 1.5% in the third quarter. Through the first 9 months of the year, our growth was 4.6%. As Irene mentioned, we expected revenue growth in the third quarter to be challenging for several reasons, including a tough prior year comparison and significantly lower contribution from pricing. Some executional missteps in a few key markets also affected the quarter. Encouragingly, despite the low overall growth, our power brands still grew 6% and are up 8% year-to-date.","Turning to profits. Adjusted pro forma operating income increased 7.5% on a constant currency basis. The effective management of input costs and lower SG&A more than offset the impact of lower volume\/mix. We continue to invest in our brands, with A&C spending increasing in line with revenue growth. A&C, as a percent of revenue, was about 9% through the first 9 months. Year-to-date, OI improved 9.3% on a constant currency basis, consistent with our long-term target of high single-digit growth. OI margin in the quarter increased 90 basis points to 13.1%. Year-to-date, OI margin also increased 90 basis points to 12.7%.","Regarding earnings per share, for the quarter, diluted EPS was up 2.6% on a constant currency basis. Strong operating gains of $0.04 were tempered by a $0.03 increase in taxes. Year-to-date, EPS grew by 7.8% on a constant currency basis. The improvement was driven by operating income growth of more than 9%, offset by a nearly 4 point increase in the effective tax rate due to some significant onetime benefits last year.","Let's now take a look at each region's performance. In Developing Markets, organic net revenue was up a modest 1.7% in the quarter, led by power brands' growth of 8%. Pricing drove 4.4 percentage points of the growth. However this was partly offset by vol\/mix declines of 2.7 points. This compares to exceptional growth of 15.5% in the third quarter last year as customers stocked-up prior to price increases that became effective in Q4. This performance also reflects the executional challenges referenced earlier.  Year-to-date, Developing Markets grew 6.8%.","Results across each of our 4 Developing Markets' sub-regions were mixed. In quarter 3, Latin America was up mid-single digits and up high-single digits year-to-date. Growth in the quarter was tempered by executional missteps in Brazil. We were slow to react to the softening Gum category. This led to rising inventories at our distributors. As we work through these inventories, we're stepping up efforts to drive category growth through increased A&C support, promotions, innovation and better price\/size architecture.","Our Biscuits performance in Brazil was also weak, despite continued strong growth of the category. This was due to lower marketing support and innovation. To stimulate our growth, we've restored marketing and promotional support and are introducing new flavors of Club Social. In contrast to these 2 categories, we continued to generate robust growth in chocolate and powdered beverages. And in the North-Northeast region of the country, we also continued to grow rapidly by expanding distribution.","Asia Pacific increased low-single digits in the quarter and was up mid- to high-single digits so far this year. India and China continued to post strong double-digit results, more than offsetting weakness in Indonesia, Australia and Japan. In India, our challenge is keeping up with demand for our chocolate. We've run into capacity constraints after posting extraordinary growth over the past couple of years. We're driving productivity and removing bottlenecks at existing plants to stretch current capacity. And we expect new production lines to come on stream by the middle of next year.  In China, Biscuits continued to drive our strong performance. Oreo led the way, growing more than 30% year-to-date, while continuing to gain market share.","As we mentioned at our Investor Day, we launched Stride Gum in August and so far, so good, although it's much too early to declare success. Overall, China continues to deliver. In fact, we expect this market to surpass $1 billion in revenue this year.","Revenue in central-eastern Europe declined mid-single digits in the quarter, due largely to Russia. Year-to-date, the region is up low-single digits. In Russia, Q3 revenue fell due to both lower vol\/mix and price. Coffee price reductions were clearly a major driver, accounting for 1\/2 the decline. But lower vol\/mix was largely our own doing. We were too slow to react to widening price gaps in coffee and chocolate, which negatively affected our shares.","We've taken a number of corrective actions to regain momentum, including getting pricing back to competitive levels. We've also gotten back to basics on sales capabilities and increased marketing support. This has yielded significant improvements beginning in September.","Finally, the Middle East and Africa was up significantly, low teens this quarter and low- to mid-teens year-to-date. The robust growth reflects strong results across the entire region including South Africa, the GCC countries and Egypt.","As we look to the fourth quarter, top line growth in Developing Markets should recover and increase high-single digits. That's just below our double-digit growth target as we work through the final stages of the short-term executional issues I mentioned.","Turning to profits in Developing Markets. Adjusted pro forma segment operating income declined 1% on a constant currency basis. The impact of lower vol\/mix was largely offset by effective management of input costs. OI margin held constant at 15.2%.","Our European business once again delivered solid results and has now posted 11 consecutive quarters of top line growth. This is especially impressive in light of the increasingly difficult economic environment. Organic revenues grew 0.7% in the quarter and 3.1% year-to-date. Power brands were up 2% in the quarter. Vol\/mix has remained consistently positive through the year, delivering about 1.5 points of growth. In the third quarter, however, vol\/mix gains were offset by lower prices especially in Coffee.","Our share performance continued to be very strong, with about 2\/3 of our revenues gaining or holding share. At a category level, Chocolate and Biscuits led the way. Chocolate increased high-single digits, reflecting continued strong performance of new products. Our power brands also performed well, with Milka up double digits; Cadbury Dairy Milk, up high single-digits; and Toblerone, up mid-single digits.","Biscuits rose low-single digits, driven by solid results from Oreo, belVita and our chocobakery platform. But Coffee offset much of this growth, decreasing low-single digits. Strong vol\/mix gains were more than offset by lower pricing. As we anticipated, coffee prices declined in the third quarter due to lower Green costs. That alone depressed total year revenue in the quarter by about 1 percentage point.","Tassimo continued its strong performance. It was up nearly 20% in the quarter due to significantly higher A&C support. Gum & Candy declined high-single digits. Candy was essentially flat, with Gum down sharply in key markets such as France, Spain and Greece.","So how are we responding? We're driving innovation. In France and Spain, we're introducing 40 Minutes, a new gum that promises extra-long freshness. And in Greece, we're launching Twist, which is similar to Stride ID in the U.S. We're making it easier for consumers at the point of buying, including resetting our hot zones in nearly 30,000 outlets and expanding our offerings across a full range of price points.","And finally, across several European markets, we're strengthening our brand equities through new marketing campaigns. We're confident that we're taking the right steps to stabilize the category in the near term and to drive modest growth in the long term.","Looking ahead, we expect Europe's overall top line growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to Q3 as we continue to deliver solid performance in a tough environment and as we reflect the decline in coffee prices.","Turning to profits. Europe continued to focus on productivity and drive overheads lower, using those savings to fund increases in A&C support behind our power brands. Adjusted pro forma segment operating income increased 7.4% on a constant currency basis. This increase, as well as the improvement in OI margin, includes the reversal of an accrual related to the Cadbury acquisition.","Turning to North America. Strong performance in Biscuits drove solid top line growth in the region. Organic net revenue was up 2.2% in the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date. U.S. Biscuits increased mid-single digits with our Biscuit power brands up double digits. Cookies grew mid- to high-single digits, with strong growth in Oreo and Chips Ahoy!. Crackers were up mid-single digits, with strong growth from Honey Maid, Ritz and Triscuit.","Biscuits' improved performance and market share gains are a direct result of the realignment of our U.S. sales force in April. We're now realizing the benefits of a direct store delivery system that's focused solely on biscuits. For example, we've increased feature and display conversion opportunities, with displays up 5% year-to-date. And we've gained additional facings on existing products, as well as drove new products into stores more quickly. So far this year, our total distribution points are up 6%.","The performance of Gum & Candy in the U.S. improved versus recent trends. Gum revenue was nearly flat as the successful launch of Stride ID in August largely offset declines in other brands. And while it's still early, we've been pleased with the performance of ID to date. In Candy, Halls and other brands were up mid-teens, driven by innovation, as well as expanded distribution.  Our business in Canada declined mid-single digits, but this was largely due to planned product pruning.","Looking ahead, North America's top line growth in Q4 is expected to accelerate. We continue to build momentum in Biscuits with a more focused DSD sales force. And we've lapped the product pruning actions we took in Canada last year.","Now let's take a look at profits in North America.  Adjusted pro forma segment operating income increased 14.1%, while margin rose 180 basis points to 16.6%. These improvements reflect strong gains from pricing and productivity, but more than offset a significant increase in A&C support behind power brands.","Before I get to our guidance, I'd now like to update you on our current estimates for transaction-related and restructuring costs. Please note that these costs are for Mondelez International only, and exclude any costs incurred by Kraft Foods Group.","In the left column, you can see our year-to-date costs, while the right column shows what we expect in future costs. We've incurred around $400 million in spin-off costs to date, and expect another $150 million going forward, with the majority in Q4. This is consistent with the approximately $600 million in spin-off costs that we originally anticipated.","Through September, we've also incurred about $100 million of restructuring and implementation costs and expect about $825 million going forward. This is consistent with the total of $925 million that we outlined in our recent 8-K filing. Although some of the restructuring costs will hit in Q4, the vast majority will be booked in 2013 and 2014.","As I mentioned in September, in the near term, we'll use the restructuring savings to help offset the synergies next year. After 2013, we expect the remaining savings to support the bottom line or to fund ongoing programs.","And finally, we've incurred about $600 million of costs associated with setting up the capital structures of both Mondelez International and Kraft Foods Group. This is consistent with the $600 million to $800 million range that we highlighted at our Investor Day. We incurred a $436 million expense this quarter related to a forward rate swap contract. These contracts were terminated in October, and we do not expect to incur further debt migration costs.","Now let's turn to our outlook. We remain confident in our ability to deliver the guidance we outlined in September. Specifically, we're confirming 2013 guidance of organic net revenue growth at the low end of our long-term target of 5% to 7%. We expect good underlying momentum on our business as economic conditions are likely to remain challenging. We also anticipate only a modest contribution from pricing, largely due to coffee.","On the bottom line, we're confirming our guidance of operating EPS of $1.50 to $1.55 on a constant currency basis. Please note that this range was based on average currency rates in August 2012. As most of you know, currency rates have been more favorable recently. In fact, if we were to use average rates from October 2012, our operating EPS guidance would increase by about $0.05. We'll review the impact of currency again when we report fourth quarter results in February next year. And since we give EPS guidance on a constant currency basis, we'll adjust our guidance to reflect the impact of currencies, either up or down, as appropriate.","So to wrap up, our revenue growth hit a bit of a speed bump in the third quarter, but we fully expect it to rebound in Q4 to mid-single digits. Developing Markets should be up high-single digits, with Europe and North America increasing low- to mid-single digits.","We continue to enjoy an advantaged geographic footprint. Growth in our categories remains robust. And our power brands and global innovation platforms will continue to drive top-tier growth. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our 2013 and long-term targets.","With that, we're now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You have a question from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","The margins were down quite a bit in Developing Markets this time around. Clearly, some of that was due to these execution issues. Are you able to parse out how much of that decline might have been driven by those execution problems in Brazil and Russia?","David A. Brearton","Actually, Alexia, the margins were flat this year at 15.2%, which is actually slightly up from where it's been year-to-date. So I -- maybe we could bridge to you what you're looking at later. But as we look at our margins, we're actually quite pleased with where our Developing Market margins were in the quarter.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And then just as a follow-up, the -- your margin expansion across the company has been very good over the last 9 months. I think you mentioned up 90 basis points on an adjusted basis year-to-date. It seems as though commodity costs are likely to be moderating going forward, and yet the outlook, it feels that you're being very muted in your expectation for margin expansion next year. I'm just wondering what you're thinking is the key risks in 2013 and why the margin expansion might not be better than you're expecting?","David A. Brearton","Well, I think the guidance we've given for next year is 5% to 7% top line growth and $1.50 to $1.55, which I think will be close to the or at the double-digit EPS growth number that we've discussed as a target. I think both of those will be top-tier. So I don't think we're being conservative. I think how that translates into margin growth, obviously, will depend on where input costs are, and that could depend on inflation in Developing Markets or commodities, as you mentioned. But for us, we're focused on delivering top-tier top and bottom line growth and the margins or the output of that as opposed to the input. So I think it will depend how we go, but we're really focused on making sure we deliver those results.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can you comment briefly on the input cost outlook from here? Everything I'm seeing with coffee and other inputs that you've got look as though it's going to get much easier. What are the main puts and takes there? Are there things that are getting harder, or do you see a general relief on input cost inflation over the next few quarters?","David A. Brearton","Well, I think as we talk costs going forward, we'll probably focus on input costs in total. And I think you're right. As it looks today, and it can all always change, it would be more for modest inflation. Our input cost today, as a snacking company, have a lower level of commodity impacts and a lot bigger impact from things like inflation in Developing Markets on some of the other factors. But as we sit here today, inflation's pretty muted amount around the globe. Coffee, as you indicated, is going down. A lot of commodities tend to be flat. Clearly, in the U.S. and some of the other countries, the grain complex is up. But we would say today that this quarter, it was relatively muted. Next quarter, there'd be no reason to change that. We don't like to give guidance going forward 15 months from now, but, at the moment, we would not see a significant input cost increase next year, which is why when we gave our guidance next year, we said we'd probably have a relatively low pricing contribution to our revenue growth. And so that's consistent with the outlook you're describing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I did the same thing Alexia did. I realized you touched on this a bit. But could you provide a bit more color on exactly what happened in Russia and Brazil? And also, if you can, it would be helpful to understand, from a revenue and EBIT standpoint, which results -- or excuse me, to what degree results were affected by those execution issues?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","Yes. So let me start by reiterating the factors that led to the missteps that I talked about are temporary and they're very much within our control. We've taken the necessary actions that we need to take to address them, and we anticipate that they will be largely resolved by the end of the year. The issues are a little bit different in each of the 2 big markets which really are at issue here. Again, we mentioned to you that we had foreshadowed the fact that our momentum, our growth in the third quarter was going to be a little bit lower than year-to-date because of the fact that we had -- there were a number of factors in terms of the difficult comps, as well as lower contribution and pricing. And that is the main -- those are the main contributors. The incremental impact of the missteps that occurred in Brazil and Russia, they were a little bit different in each of the 2 countries. In the case of Brazil, we've got 2 issues: Gum and Biscuits. Gum, as Dave mentioned, we were slow to react to a gradually weakening economy. That category had been growing in the high-single digits, and we continued to ship as the category growth slowed almost in 1\/2 to about 4%. And as a result, we found ourselves in a dislocation between our distributor inventories and our consumption. So our consumption continued to be reasonably okay, but we had some short-term dislocations and we expect that the rebalancing that's in process right now will be completed by year-end. The bigger issue is why has the category growth slowed, and we've talked about the fact we have taken a number of actions to accelerate our growth. We have increased our marketing and our sales support. We focused very much on our execution at point-of-sale, particularly our assortment at point-of-sale. We've got increased merchandising support. We've got increased support behind our new advertising campaign. We're looking to continue to expand our distribution in the fast-growing north-northeast part of the country, and we have taken a number of steps to improve the offerings from a price\/size standpoint as we have watched the GDP in Brazil, as well as we see in a number of countries, declining somewhat. So all that said, that was the issue within Gum. We feel we are very much on it and on track to address that. The bigger -- the other issue though, in Brazil, turned out to be Biscuits, which, quite frankly, became a knock on impact from Gum. It's about reduced marketing support. The category was growing fine. We just reduced our marketing support to offset some of the Gum weakness and it was a mistake. And we have since restored that marketing support and we're quite confident that, that business will rebound. As Dave mentioned, no issues with Chocolate in Brazil. Our powdered beverage growth was quite strong and continued strong growth in the North-Northeast. So that's the situation in Brazil. We've got our arms around it and we're taking the necessary actions. Russia is a little bit of a different situation. 1\/2 of that decline was due to the significant drop in coffee cost, but the other 1\/2 was volume\/mix and it was driven by price gaps, excessive price gaps in both Chocolate and Coffee. We were slow to respond to the fact that competitors had dropped prices and we didn't. It resulted in share losses and that was the biggest issue that we had in Coffee and Chocolate. We've taken the necessary price reductions. Both categories, again, remain quite robust in Russia and we're quite confident that we will be able to correct that situation. The other piece of our issue in Russia was just our sales execution wasn't where we need it to be. We've stepped up the focus in that area. We've made some -- we've strengthened our leadership in a couple of places, particularly, in sales, and again, we feel quite comfortable that we will be able to resolve that. So net-net, these are temporary issues. They're issues that are entirely within our control, and we're quite confident that we will be able to see a rebound in the fourth quarter and into 2013.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's helpful. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Dave.","David A. Brearton","In terms of impact, it depends what your base assumption was. So I'll let you make your own base assumption, but Brazil is about a $2.5 billion business and it was flat. So you can determine what you thought it was going to be. It was double-digit growth last year. And Russia is about a $1.5 billion business and it was down low double digits, and last year, it was not. So I'll let you establish your own base, but those are kind of the parameters that you could work with.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You've been listening to too many politicians, Dave.","Irene B. Rosenfeld","It's a big margin that they had in...","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And, guys, I'm sorry to -- one more my question, if that's okay. All the moving pieces you have, any insights you can provide into 4Q's interest expense and tax rate would be useful. And just to clarify, should we be comfortable with, roughly, the pension expense you saw in this quarter and the corporate expense you saw this quarter going forward in our models or maybe there's some puts and takes there we're not aware of going forward?","David A. Brearton","Yes, I think the -- if I start from the corporate expense. I think the geography may change between businesses et cetera, going forward, but I think in aggregate, it's directionally correct in the stuff we've provided. In terms of interest expense, similarly, we've tried to do pro forma adjustments that sort of assume the entire $10 billion of debt had been transferred across the Kraft Foods Group. So again, that should be roughly in line. Tax rates, we've given you guidance of mid-20s. I'm not going to give you specific guidance for quarter 4, but I will remind you that last year, we had a very, very low tax rate because we had a big one-timer. So you can expect what I'll call close to a normal tax rate probably in quarter 4 this year, but the comparison to last year will be quite different.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","2 questions actually, for Dave. One, just very briefly, you mentioned a favorable onetime item in Europe. I believe it was the reversal of a Cadbury accrual. Can you quantify what the benefit of that was on an operating income basis?","David A. Brearton","Yes, I think it'll show up in the 10-Q, so I guess I can. It's just over $0.01, $0.015, in that range of impact for the quarter.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And as you continue to explore the options you have around allocating the excess cash on your balance sheet right now, have there been any changes or new developments in your thinking on how you're approaching the debt issuances you have maturing in early, mid next year or the potential for any other refinancing going forward?","David A. Brearton","Yes, I think there have. I mean, essentially what we've agreed is, as you know, we've got about $3.5 billion of debt maturing during the course of next year; about 1\/2 of that in the first half and about 1\/2 of that in the second half. And I'm sitting on about $2 billion of excess cash, plus or minus. But we have decided we will not -- that we will hold onto that cash and just pay down the debt as it matures in the first half of the year. And it's a little early to talk about cash utilization on the back half of the year. But that decision really is what triggered the expensing of the swap loss. So we're not going to be issuing any debt in the first part of the year and we're going to be sitting on our cash and just paying down those maturities as they come due.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a question for you. When I look at the Gum & Candy category, it did -- it seems to have improved a bit in the quarter. I think you mentioned about 4% overall category growth. So I wanted to ask 2 questions around that. One would be that is that due to Candy growth and Gum remaining still soft? And then just to better understand the difference between your reported 1% decline in that category and then the underlying category improving, is the gap just those markets where you were misexecuting, if you will, or is there other areas or factors there to consider?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","Yes. So within the 4% that I talked about, Chris, that's a combination of essentially, a flat Gum category and a 7% growth in the Candy category. So when I talk about why we are quite optimistic, both -- virtually, all of our categories are growing. Our issue is Gum and we did lose some share in Gum in a number of key markets. Actually Brazil, which we've talked a lot about some of the executional issues, we actually grew share in Brazil. But we do have some share opportunities in a number of markets. And a lot of the work that we're doing on price size architecture, on restoring spending will help also to -- as well as stepped up innovation, things like ID that we've just launched in the U.S. will help to step up our share performance. So they're going to help to not only stimulate the category, but also, in select cases, should help to improve our share performance as well. But the big issue is really the category and that's really what we've been focused on.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I had just one follow-up question. I think for Dave, just regarding -- you cited constant currency EPS growth this year, year-to-date at plus 8%. Is that a bit of apples and oranges? Is that including Kraft as well North America, or is that a good number to cite for Mondelez year-to-date?","David A. Brearton","No, that's a good number, as best as we can do for Mondelez year-to-date. We took out Kraft Foods Group as a discontinued operation. It's technically not discontinued until quarter 4, but we've done it on a pro forma basis for you. And we've tried to adjust interest and pensions to align with how our business will be going forward. So it's a good number. The reason it's 8% versus we would normally be expecting higher, is again, the tax rate. So last year, it was a very low tax rate. It's about 4 points higher this year than last year. It's about 22% year-to-date, last year it was about 18%. And that's why you're seeing some of the operating income growth get lost from the 9% of the OI level, down to 8% of the EPS level. But it's a pretty comparable number.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Katzman at Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. I guess when we were up in Boston and we went through the company kind of for the first time, there wasn't a whole lot of focus on the non-power brands and it seems as if, if I'm doing the comps correctly, that the non-power brands in most markets were down. Could you talk about that and what that means? And I understand that your -- if my math is right, your EBIT was up about 4%, so it didn't necessarily impact your EBIT, but how should we think about that?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","Well, first of all, power brands represent almost 60% of our revenue on a year-to-date basis and as we continue to grow them disproportionately relative to the base business, they will become an increasingly large portion of the business. One of the reasons you don't see as much of an impact on the OI line is that typically, they're not power brands because they have lower margins and so that's why we are essentially de-emphasizing them. So for the most part, we are seeing a weaker performance on the brands that we are de-emphasizing, many of them are local brands. And again, our power brands will continue to be an increasingly large percentage of the portfolio, and that's what's going to fuel our top line growth.","David A. Brearton","And, Eric, just so you don't panic on the -- all other brands, in the quarter, it is true that the power brands grew and the non-power brands declined. If you look year-to-date, the power brands grew 8% and the non-power brands were about flat and that's -- so it's not like they're falling off a cliff. We are making ongoing strategic decisions on the portfolio, but we don't see this as a huge headwind. It's more a question of they're going to be growing a lot less, maybe flat some years, maybe growing slightly other years, but we don't see it as a huge decline. Quarter 3 really was a bit unusual, but you're right, they were down in quarter 3.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. And then so -- just so I'm -- again, I'm getting this right since we're all kind of getting to know the stand-alone company correctly. So the 60% that's power brands and the 40% that's non-power brands, that is of the snack and confection side of things and there's another 27% or so that is...","Irene B. Rosenfeld","No, no, no. That -- No, the numbers I just quoted to you, Eric, that's for the total company.","David A. Brearton","So we have power brands in -- Tang is a power brand. When we talked at the investor roadshow, we really only talked to snacking because that is 3\/4 of our business. In Coffee and in powdered beverages, which are also strategic categories for us, we also have power brands. So in Coffee, you've got Jacobs coffee in Europe, for example, they're huge and you've got Tang and powdered beverages, those are also power brands and they're equally significant, they're equally high margin and they're equally good growth.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so the non-snack and confection side of things, it sounds like Coffee, given the competitive issues in Russia and the price pass-through that you took that, that was -- at least part of those non-snack and confection business that was part of the drop?","David A. Brearton","Not really. I think Coffee actually is up around the same as the rest of the business year-to-date. So we said we're up about -- we're up 4.6% year-to-date on our total organic growth. Coffee actually would be consistent with that. I think what you'll see on Coffee is as we lap the pricing we took last year and we adjust to lower pricing, the price portion of that revenue growth is getting much, much smaller and in the quarter, it was actually negative, you're right. But the vol\/mix is getting much stronger. And so Coffee, for us, has been a pretty good growth driver this year. It's been about in line with the total company.","Operator","Next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess just a question back on the building [ph] markets and it's I guess more particularly Russia. And if I remember it right, the second quarter organic sales in Russia was also soft. And it appears like especially ex-Russia, so the rest of the Central and Eastern Europe, is seeing some softness in the consumer. So I guess, as you look forward in Russia, beyond just fixing some price gap issues, were you at all concerned at this point that there's more of a macro headwind there? And I guess I would say the same thing for Brazil. It's been such a strong market for you and is there any concern there that the macro picture's a little bit different today than maybe what we were thinking about back in September?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","I don't think so, Bryan. I mean, as we look at our peer performance in these markets, they continue to be strong. We certainly have seen GDP slowdown in both of the markets, Brazil to a greater extent perhaps than Russia. But the issues that we're facing, we believe were of our own making. As I said before, they're very much in our control and they're quite fixable. So we have every confidence that they will continue to be growth markets for us.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And, Irene, were you surprised that the -- that Biscuits in Brazil slowed as quickly as it did? It was as a response of a reactive to the reduction in the marketing support. It seems like a pretty quick linkage between reducing marketing support and seeing the volumes drop. Were you surprised by that?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","Yes. But I mean there's a -- like we're doing a pretty deep dive on these 2 businesses as you would imagine and there's a lot of moving parts there. I'm trying to give you a best sense of the headlines there. But we did end up with a fairly significant loss of share of voice and we can trace that pretty directly to our share performance. So I believe that we have our -- we have a good sense of what the issue was there. It's not entirely marketing support, but it was predominantly that.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And are the competitors increasing their share of voice or do you have some competitors in Biscuits that are spending more now?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","No. Again, it was just -- we did it to ourselves. We just basically reduced our levels. We've now restored our levels back and we've got a very strong Biscuit business in Brazil and we're quite confident that that'll -- that, that business will rebound.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Can you just talk about your opportunities and challenges in Japan and Australia? Those are part of your Developing Markets and I just wanted to kind of figure out how you see those calling out for the next year or so.","David A. Brearton","Yes. I think Australia, we've got a great Chocolate business and I think we've had some good new products lately. I think in quarter 3, it was a bit weak, but that was more of a phasing thing to do with a system go live that we had in a prior quarter. We always load prior to the system go live. So not material to the total company, but in Australia, it did result in it moving from a low single-digit growth to a low single-digit decline. So it wasn't dramatic, but it's a mature market with a great Chocolate business and we see it as continuing to chug along. Japan is a gum market and, therefore, it shares a lot of the challenges Irene's talked about on the Gum business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I was just curious, Irene, now that you look at your global business, if you've done stress tests as to how many markets would have to miss expectations or even exceed expectations before you would change guidance. Like you've seen weakness this quarter in Russia and Brazil that affected the top line, can you just comment a little bit on kind of stress testing the global portfolio and what needs to change versus your expectations to make a major shift in expectations?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","Yes, let me start by saying, Ann, we've had a terrific run in our developing markets these past few years by any measure. And, in fact, our first half, we were up 9.5%. So we had a speed bump in the third quarter and we're not happy about it and it's a fact, but we shouldn't overreact to 1 quarter. We actually believe that one of the benefits of the company is that we've got a fairly well-dispersed geographic footprint so that no 1 market is -- basically, we've got a pretty good footprint within -- around the world, so that we have the opportunity. If we see issues in 1 particular market, we have a good, good, good offsets elsewhere. It just so happens that Brazil and Russia are 2 very large markets and, simultaneously, they had some issues at a time that our capacity was constrained in some of our other growth engine markets. So it was kind of a little bit of a perfect storm there but net-net, we, of course, continue to look at the composite profile of our developing markets, particularly as it represents a significant part of our portfolio. But we're quite confident that those markets will rebound and will improve in the fourth quarter as we've said and return to double digits in 2013.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then regarding projected productivity savings, is that still a 4% target?","David A. Brearton","Yes, that's still a -- we'll be 4% or higher on our gross productivity going forward. It's -- we achieved that this year and so far and we expect to do that going forward as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit more about the restructuring program. So in the 8-K filing, Dave, I think it's $925 million. Irene, can you talk to us a little bit about the evolution? This is nearly $1 billion. This is an enormous restructuring program. I think there's a lot to say about blue biscuits and the opportunities that have yet to have been realized in restructuring that, maybe the legacy Kraft European operations and even some restructuring in North America. I'm not really all that clear on maybe more of the story behind the $925 million and then the benefits that we're going to get from it and I think it's an important part of the story going forward. So if you could, I would love for you to just explain about what's happening here.","David A. Brearton","Yes, I can take that, David. I mean, the restructuring program is $925 million, as you said, and there's really 3 components to it. The first would be overheads as we resize corporate headquarters for the smaller company we now are and as we resize North America snacks to reflect the fact that it is a stand-alone snacks business now. Second is manufacturing and as you rightly say, we need to streamline our manufacturing to reflect the fact that we're now a focused snacks business and that has some implications. I can't really give you a lot of details on it because, frankly, we have to run those projects through our Board and, as importantly, we have to run those projects through our unions and our works councils. So we're working through that process, but you probably saw in the last 2 or 3 weeks, we've announced a closure of a coffee factory in Austria and we announced the closure of a large snacks factory up in Canada. So we're working through these, they'll continue to go. And then the third piece is on the distribution network where North America is now a DSD-focused business and that's got some implications on distribution. So those are the 3 pieces. It is $925 million, it is a lot of money, I accept that. About 2\/3 of it is cash, about 1\/3 is noncash. The vast majority of the spending will be in 2013 and 2014 and, after that, we would see ourselves self-funding ongoing restructuring program within the guidance we've provided to you. In terms of savings, I think we've said that next year, we have a dis-synergy headwind and the restructuring savings next year will cover about 1\/2 of that. So the savings will start to flow through next year and it'll cover about 1\/2 of our dis-synergies. We would expect the savings in '14 to cover the rest of those dis-synergies and any incremental profit in '15 and beyond, we would look to either support the bottom line or reinvest in growth opportunities. But it's really '15 and beyond before we'll see a net benefit between dis-synergy and restructuring.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's really helpful. 2 other quick questions. The first one is on the Starbucks arbitration proceedings and any update that you could give us on the timing of that decision?","David A. Brearton","Yes, the arbitration case actually closed in August. So the arbitrator is considering the arguments as we speak. We remain pretty confident in the merits of our case, but I regret to say, I don't have any updates to you on really anything beyond that.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. So then that would mean that the decision is some time very soon, is that reasonable?","David A. Brearton","Some time. There is no time line on the arbitration. So it really is up to the arbitrator when he wants to come back with his decision.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. Final question on Brazil. Irene, I believe you had a leadership change down there. Does that have any implications to the problems that you cited in the quarter?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","No. I mean, David, one challenging quarter does not cause us to make personnel changes. We did make some leadership changes in a couple of our markets, but those were things that were in the works for quite some time and I'm very pleased that we've got a deep bench of talent and we've got some very strong leaders in all of our key markets. So it's not related.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Dickerson of Consumer Edge Research.","Robert Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research, LLC","I just had a question really on strategy around Western European Coffee. Again, I know as you pointed out earlier in the investor presentation and both today in the slides and in the prepared remarks, most of the focus, obviously, is on snacks. But as you said that you're always looking to actually make strategic shifts within the portfolio and that Jacobs is still considered a power brand, I'm wondering if you could just add a little bit more specific color around what would be your strategy for the next year to really be still picking up share in the Coffee category in Western Europe?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","Well, again, Rob, Coffee is an important part of our portfolio in our Western and Eastern Europe businesses. And as Dave mentioned before, we've had -- Europe has had a very strong performance on Coffee. The revenue decline is reflecting the fact that we took price declines in response to the lower Green, but our vol\/mix continues to be quite solid. Our Tassimo business is growing in the upwards of 20%. We've continued to support it and we see it as a continued growth engine. We've been very pleased with our Millicano product; it's a whole bean instant coffee, which continues to perform well. So Coffee is an important part of our European portfolio and we will continue to invest in that franchise, and it will be an important source of growth and the category is growing. The challenge that I referenced in Eastern Europe, it's -- Coffee is an important business there as well, particularly in Russia and I referred -- referenced the fact that we did -- we were slow to respond to price gaps on Coffee and it cost us some share. And as I mentioned, we've taken action to address that and we should see that business rebound. So in both of those regions, we feel Coffee plays a very important role and it is growing.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted just to ask a question about your -- the composition of your revenue growth. You may have addressed this earlier and if you did, I apologize. But with regard to volume versus price for 2013, if you are going to deliver at that 5%, is that half and half volume\/mix and price?","David A. Brearton","We haven't given a specific target, but we have said pricing is going to be a modest -- more modest contributor next year than it's been recently. I mean, as an example, year-to-date, pricing is about 4 points, whereas in the third quarter, it's only 2 points. So it'll be a more modest contributor out of the 5% to 7% next year.","David Palmer - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And do you -- one question that certainly comes up when we see this quarter is the issue of volatility. One of the things that we would expect from a global business is that you might have a little bit less volatility in that top line. Do you -- when you're looking ahead to 2013, as you see how the comps are laid out and the issues perhaps would -- economically and with Gum in particular, do you anticipate some quarters that -- do you anticipate volatility to continue is my question?","Irene B. Rosenfeld","David, as I said earlier, we are -- we feel very good about our footprint and we believe we are much less susceptible to volatility as a result. We've got roughly equal-size businesses in Asia Pacific, in Latin America and in our combined CEEMA regions. We've got no single country in our Developing Markets portfolio that is contributing to more than 5% of our sales. And so we've got a pretty balanced profile. We just had a bit of a perfect storm in 2 of our largest countries at a time that we didn't have as much of an opportunity to offset it with -- in some of our other countries because of some of the capacity challenges. But year-to-date, we've certainly been able to offset any of our challenges by the strength that we've had in China, in India and in the Middle East and Africa, and we continue to see that profile playing out well for us.","Operator","Your final question comes from Robert Moskow of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I thought the split ups were a good idea until I read we had to do these -- do 2 conference calls and 2 notes, I don't know. Maybe consolidation is the way to go. But just one last question; I believe the long-term plan has always been for emerging markets to increase overhead at a greater pace than sales. But now that you've had a couple of stumbles here in Brazil and Russia, it looks like the type of spending you're going to have to do there is going to be a little different, at least in the short run. How have these issues impacted your plan for infrastructure investment in those 2 markets for 2013?","David A. Brearton","Yes, I don't think we've ever said it was going to grow above revenue, certainly, sales. But sales is only one component of the overheads and we would expect to leverage scale on the rest of the overheads as we grow those businesses. So I would expect overheads in Developing Markets to grow at or less than the revenue rate over time. I think in Russia and Brazil, in particular, as we talk about these issues, I don't think these issues had an implication on the infrastructure in those countries. It's not like we have to stand back and add a bunch of new people and new capability. I don't think that's the issue. Will we continue to invest in overheads in those countries where we can expand distribution and gain more sales? Yes, we would, but I think it would be more on the opportunity upside than just correcting some of the things we talked about today.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Lastly, Dave, are you updating your interest expense guidance at all for 2013? It seems like the plan as to how you utilize your cash is different. I have $1.2 billion in my model. Is there any reason for me to change it?","David A. Brearton","We haven't -- I don't think we've ever given specific interest expense guidance. But I think you can probably work it out yourself pretty easily.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe it's time, Dave.","David A. Brearton","So we are going to end up starting the year with more debt than normal and as that matures, we're going to use our free cash to pay it down and the maturities are basically in March and May that we're talking about. So you could probably model that out fairly quickly. Unfortunately, the cash that I have on the balance sheet doesn't deliver much income. So it really is going to be excess interest cost in the first half and then to a more normal level in the back half.","Operator","This concludes the allotted time for today's Q&A session.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondelez management and a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay as President, Investor Relations for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay","Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Brearton, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release. This release and today's slides are available on our website mondelezinternational.com.","As you know, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You could find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks Dexter and good afternoon. Our first quarter performance was in line with the expectations that we communicated earlier this year. Revenue growth remains a lower long term target and were certainly not satisfied with that. But behind the aggregate numbers our underlined business momentum continued to improve as we drove a virtuous growth cycle in each region. Emerging markets accelerated sequentially while results in developed markets continued to be solid. Revenue growth was high quality driven by volume mix, strong power brand and market share gains. Our biscuits, chocolates and candy categories continued to grow strongly.","Adjusted growth profit increased which provided the fuel to step-up our investments in emerging markets. While we are well positioned in many of these countries today the raise is clearly on to fortify and expand our presence. As a focus snapping company we believe that now is the time to step our investments in brand building, in sales, in route to market and in capacity to ensure we planted a necessary seed that will bear fruit for many years to come. We begin to see the payoff of these investments clearly as revenue growth accelerates in the second half. With this solid underlying momentum we remain confident in our ability to deliver our full year commitments as well as sustainable, profitable growth over the long term. Let\u2019s look now at the detail for the quarter.","Organic net revenue grew 3.8%, as we said the impact of lower coffee prices and capacity constraints again tempered top line growth. These two factors will continue to affect our second quarter, until we lapse the price declines and new capacity comes on stream. We are encouraged, however, by the underlying quality of our revenue. Our focus on power brands continues to payoff. In fact, they grew 7.5% nearly equaled our overall rate. Our volume mix trends were also strong accounting for two-thirds of our growth. These vol mix and power brand games in turn translated into solid market shares.","Looking at our results geographically, we see the same underlying trend. In developed markets, Europe delivered solid volume mix growth and U.S. biscuits continue to benefit from a focus direct store delivery sales force. In emerging markets, revenue was up over 9%, that\u2019s about a point higher than last quarter despite the impact of capacity constraints. Our performance in the BRIC countries was also solid. Brazil grew strongly up mid-teens; China up more than 20%. India grew road double-digits despite capacity constraints in chocolate.","Russia was up modestly, but its growth represented a significant turnaround from the declines posted in the back half of 2012. We continue to focus on increasing gross profit to generate the fuel to sustain our growth. In the first quarter adjusted gross profit through nearly 4% on a constant currency basis driven by vol mix gains. This helps fund advertising and consumer support at 9.6% of revenues, up 20 basis points from our full year 2012 rates. Higher adjusted gross profit also enabled us to invest in sales capabilities and through market expansions in our emerging markets. These increased investments along with some one-time items dampened operating income growth and margins. We remain committed to expanding overall operating income margin by an average of 20 to 30 basis points annually. But in the near-term, we will continue to use cost savings, particularly from Europe and North America to strengthen our emerging markets position.","Let\u2019s now take a look at each of our categories. Globally, biscuits were up 8%, including 13% growth of our power brands. Oreo was the key driver, up mid-teens, the world\u2019s favorite cookie posted strong growth in each regions. And if the top selling biscuit plans in China, during the critical New Year season. A number of other biscuit brands also performed well. Barney grew mid-teens. Shift up the way with the high-teens as we continue to broaden distribution in emerging markets. At our top and Club Social Savory brands increased nearly 30% behind new marketing campaigns. Geographically, biscuits grew low double-digits in emerging markets with strong growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. And in developed markets, both North America and Europe drove mid single-digit games. Biscuits also delivered outstanding share performance with nearly 90% of our revenue in key markets gaining or holding share.","Turning to chocolate, global revenue increased 5%. Power brands grew nearly twice as fast led by Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk, and Lacta. In emerging markets, chocolate revenue was up double-digits. In Brazil, a solid Easter season and strong growth of Lacta drove the gains. And in India, chocolate grew low double-digits despite the impact of the capacity constraints I mentioned earlier. Smaller markets such as Egypt, Argentina and Poland also delivered good growth.","In developed markets, chocolate revenue was up low single-digits with a strong showing in Europe. Overall, more than half of our chocolate revenue in key markets gained more held share. Gum and candy revenue however remain disappointing declining 1%. The decrease was driven entirely by gum\u2019s poor performance in developed markets. Here revenue was down high-teens as category trends continue to soften. We also lost some share.","As we stated before, we are not counting on a significant turnaround in gum this year and our guidance reflects that. But I assure you we\u2019re not sitting idly by and accepting these trends. We\u2019re actively testing a number of ideas to rejuvenate the category and we have begun to roll out several initiatives to stem our share declines.","First we\u2019re changing price size architecture on both ends of the spectrum, more small packs at lower price points and more value offerings in larger pack sizes. Second, hard hitting advertising that focuses on functional benefits such as oral care. Third, driving better placement up high in pack displays and fourth getting the right product assortment on shelf. Early result of these initiatives have been encouraging, but due to the sheer breadth of retail outlets to be addressed as well as the timing of shelf resets rolling out these initiatives broadly have taken much longer than we would have liked.","In contrast gum in emerging markets grew nicely up mid-single digits with solid share gains. The launch of Stride in China last August and strong results in Brazil led the way. Also helping to offset the gum challenges candy again delivered strong results up mid-single digits with growth in both emerging and developed markets all through a stand-out up low teens behind innovation and the benefit of a rough, cold and flu seasons.","Finally in our beverages and cheese and grocery categories revenue was flat while power brands grew 2%. Coffee revenues declined mid-single digits as we passed through significantly lower green coffee cost especially in our roast and ground business. On demand and soluble coffee on the other hand which together account for more than half of our global coffee revenues performed well. Finally powered beverages continue to deliver strong performance with revenue up mid-teens.","So in sum our overall results were in-line with expectations with encouraging evidence up strong underlying momentum. Let me now turn it over to Dave to provide additional information about our first quarter performance as well as our updated outlook.","Dave Brearton","Thanks Irene and good afternoon. Before reviewing our quarter one results in more detail let me first highlight the changes to our reporting structure of 2013. Previously we reported our operations in three segments, North America, Europe and developing markets. With the spin-off of our North America grocery operations we have changed our reporting segments this year to give investors more clarity into our operations. We now report in five segments, North America, Europe, Eastern Europe, Middle-Eastern and Africa or EMEA, Asia-Pacific and Latin America. We issued an 8K last month that provided a historical breakdown of revenue and operating income based on these new reporting segments. The 8K included annual results for 2010 to 2012 and quarterly results for the past two years. In another effort to provide insight into the business we have delineated our portfolio into two parts. Emerging markets and developed markets, we define emerging markets to include all of the Latin America and EMEA segments.","Our Asia-Pacific segment excluding Australia, New Zealand and Japan is included as well. We also add the Central European countries that are now part of the Europe segment. Using this definition 39% of the revenues were generated in emerging markets last year. Developed markets include all of North America, our Europe segment excluding the countries of Central Europe and Australia, New Zealand and Japan. When discussing our performance in emerging and developed markets we will limit the commentary to revenue.","We will continue to report profitability only for our five regional segments. With that let\u2019s now take a closer look at our top-line results. As Irene mentioned we delivered 3.8% organic revenue growth, vol mix grew 2.5 percentage points or about two thirds of the increase while pricing contributed 1.3 points. This included the impact of lower coffee prices as well as capacity constraints in a number of markets. Overall, coffee revenue negatively affected our growth rate by 1.3 points, that\u2019s higher than what we expected largely due to the timing of sales of roast and ground coffee in Europe. In addition, capacity constraints provided a headwind of about a 0.5 point. This impact is lower than expected as we successfully stretched capacity and we have core manufacturers to increase production.","Emerging markets grew 9.3% in the first quarter. I will move to our double-digit target. That compares favorably to the 8.4% rate we delivered in both Q4 and for the full year 2012, as growth in both Brazil and Russia improved considerably. Developed markets grew 0.004%. That\u2019s primarily due to the impact of coffee pricing.","Let\u2019s now take a closer look at top line performance into the regions. In Latin America, organic revenue was up strong 12.6%. To offset inflation, we took aggressive pricing actions in several markets. As a result, pricing contributed 9.4 percentage points with 3.2 points due to vol mix gains. Brazil was the region\u2019s star performer. In the first quarter, revenue was up mid-teens, well above the mid single-digit increase posted in the fourth quarter. This growth was high quality driven by vol mix. It was also broad based with strong performance in each of Brazil\u2019s key categories. The North Northeast region also performed well, up 25% as we continued to expand distribution. Brazil posted notable market share gains in chocolate, gum, and powder beverages.","Performance in other key Latin American markets also was solid. In Venezuela, growth was quite strong despite the country\u2019s economic challenges. And in Argentina, growth remains solid, but smooth in the phase of price control just limited our flexibility. The region\u2019s power brands increased 12% led by Club Social, Oreo, and Halls.","In each of the system, organic revenue grew 5.8% including 4.1 points from vol mix and 1.7 points from pricing. Double-digit growth in emerging markets drove the region\u2019s top line performance. China and India led the way. China grew more than 20% due to solid growth in biscuits and contributions from Stride gum. Since launching last August, Stride has been a strong performer already capturing about 5 points of market share. China also gained share in biscuits behind Oreo and (indiscernible), although biscuit category trends softened this quarter.","In India, our business was up double-digits. So, certainly not bad that growth and share continued to be tempered by capacity constraints in Tuc\/Club. We look forward to returning to faster growth as new production lines come on stream by mid-year. At that point, we will be better able to meet the demand for the chocolate category that\u2019s growing over 20%.","In contrast, the strong growth in emerging markets, the region\u2019s developed markets declined low single-digits. This was largely due to a double-digit decrease in gum in Japan. Overall, the recent power brands do more than 20% led by Stride, Tang, Oreo, and Cadbury Dairy Milk. In EMEA, organic revenue grew 4% driven by strong vol mix gains of 7.4 percentage points. These gains were partially offset, however, by lower coffee and chocolate pricing in Russia and other Eastern European markets.","Russia continued to improve sequentially despite this pricing pressure. Revenue rose 2% overall with vol mix up about 9 points offset by 7 points of lower pricing. We are very encouraged with the progress of our new management team. In addition to revenue rebounding, shares are also recovering in biscuits and gum. Coffee and chocolate, however, still have to improve.","In addition to Russia, other countries in the region including Ukraine, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa also contributed meaningfully to growth in the quarter. Power brands grew 8% led by double-digit growth in Cadbury Dairy Milk, Oreo, Barni, Tuc and Tang. Turning to Europe, organic revenue increased modestly, a strong vol mix was mostly offset by lower coffee prices. In fact, lower coffee revenues reduced Europe\u2019s overall growth by more than 2 points. Vol mix was especially strong in biscuits, chocolates and on-demand coffee. Power brands increased 3%, in biscuits vol mix scheme showed mid to single high digit growth led by continued strength of belVita, Oreo and the chocolate bakery platform. In fact chocolate bakery is on track to cross the $250 million mark this year. This could also deliver strong share performance across Europe with notable gains in France and Italy. In chocolate revenues rose mid-single digits nearly all due to vol mix. Sales was strong across continental Europe. Milka led the way up double digits behind the successful Easter season and strong marketing efforts. We also gained share in Germany and other key markets. In UK revenue was down modestly as we cycled last year successful Bubbly launch. Coffee revenues declined mid to high single digits due to significantly lower coffee pricing. In addition to the impact of lower prices roast and ground volume also fell due to the timing of some promotional activities. That said (inaudible) grew nearly 30% behind significant marketing support and revenue for Millicano soluble coffee rose 35%.","Gum and candy revenues decreased high single digits, nearly all of that was due to poor performance in gum. The gum category continues to decline across Europe. Unfortunately our share performance was also soft as competitors stepped up promotional activity and private label gain share in Southern Europe. We\u2019re just beginning to implement some of the government issues here that have been successful elsewhere in the world.","In candy, Halls grew double digits and Indulgent Candy did well. But overall candy revenues were down slightly as we continue to deemphasize lower margin skews. In North America organic revenues increased 2.4% with a good balance of 1.5 point pricing and 9\/10 of a point from vol mix. Strong performance in biscuits drove solid growth across the region. In the U.S. biscuits through mid-single digits for the 7th quarter in a row as our focus DFC sales force continued to increase distribution points. As a result we gained 80 basis points of share in biscuits year to date.","There were several stars among our U.S. power brands in the quarter. Chips Ahoy! was up high teens behind increased distribution, improved velocity and innovation, belVita also continued it's strong performance up low teens. Honey Maid and Triscuit each delivered strong growth driven by innovation and solid performance in the base business and Oreo generated double digit growth despite lacking strong performance a year ago related to the brand\u2019s 100th birthday.","U.S. gum and candy fell about 10% overall due to gum weakness. As Irene mentioned gum was down sharply as a decline in the category accelerated. Finally our Canada business stabilized in the first quarter. It was up low single digits as we resolve the sales disruptions resulting from the spend.","Turning now to profits, adjusted gross profit on a constant currency basis increased 3.9% in the first quarter. This was driven by strong vol mix change. In addition we were able to fully offset higher input cost through pricing. Gains were broad based as adjusted gross profit a constant currency increased in each region, this provided the fuel for growth investments. Adjusted growth margin was flat to the prior year at 37.2%.","Adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis was down 4% this was largely due to cycling the net benefit of onetime items in the prior year. Excluding this impact adjusted OI constant currency was only down modestly. As a Irene noted earlier we reinvested our higher growth profit to fortify and expand our position in emerging markets. Adjusted operating income margin was 10.3% in the quarter, the decline of a 160 basis points reflects 60 points from the devaluation of net monetary assets in Venezuela, 40 points from cycling the prior year one-time items, and the balance from a variety of factors including the increased investment in growth initiatives.","Turning now to earnings per share, diluted EPS was $0.32 and operating EPS was $0.34, up nearly 10%. On a constant currency basis, operating EPS, it was up more than 20%. Step up investments in growth initiatives resulted in a $0.01 decline to operating earnings. Cycling the net impact of the prior year one-time items was also a $0.01 drag. As a result, the increase in operating EPS was attributable to a positive impact of $0.09 from lower taxes, although $0.07 of which is from discrete items.","Turning to our 2013 guidance, on the top line we continued to expect organic net revenue growth at the low end of our long-term 5% to 7% guidance. As we have outlined previously, we expect growth in the first half to be around 3.5%. Similar to Q1, lower copper prices and capacity constraints will continue temper growth in the second quarter. However, we expect revenue growth to accelerate in the back half of the year as we begin to cycle the impact of lower cost of pricing in the third quarter and as new capacity comes on mid year. We increased our operating EPS outlook to $1.55 to $1.60. This represents an increase of $0.03 from our previous guidance as we flow through the fund cap of the $0.07 tax benefit from discrete items. Since it\u2019s still early in the year and considering the volatility in many of our markets, we are holding the other half in reserve at this time.","Let me make one last point on our EPS outlook. As you may recall, this range reflects average 2012 foreign exchange rates as well as an estimated negative $0.04 impact from the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar. Of course, current rates will vary from the average 2012 rates that our operating EPS guidance uses. Based on current impacts recorded to-date and spot rates as of April 30, our EPS would be about $0.03 lower than the $1.55 to $1.50 guidance. We will continue to provide you with ForEx sensitivity as the year unfolds.","With that, let me now turn the call back to Irene for some concluding remarks.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks, Dave. Most of our results were in line with expectations were certainly satisfied with our revenue growth this quarter, but the underlying fundamentals of our business are solid. Our emerging markets continue to improve sequentially. Vol mix change and power brands drove high quality top line growth. Our biscuits, chocolate, and candy categories continued to pose strong revenue in share, unadjusted gross profit through globally enabling us to step up our investments in emerging markets.","We will continue to build on this momentum as our growth accelerates in the back half of the year. Now, we would be happy to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The flow is now open for your options. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Good afternoon everybody.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","I guess my first question is I realize you invested back much of the discrete tax benefit in the quarter to drive top line growth and that accounted for some of the EBIT shortfall I guess versus where sort of many investor models were? I guess my question is regarding that the balance between operating profit and top line growth and whether I guess the two pin codes exist going forward given the Street view that there is significant margin opportunity to be had or perhaps today they prove mutually exclusive just for some period of time until you get the top line moving to where you waned to be?","Irene Rosenfeld","There is a couple of questions in there, Andrew. Let me start by saying the money that we have reinvested in our emerging markets is from operating earnings, it is not from the tax benefits. We have not reinvested that money if they have mentioned we dropped pathway to the bottom line and we are holding the balancing reserve just early in the year where we want to make sure that we keep our powder dry, but most importantly, as you asked this question about the balance between margin and growth and top line growth, I am asking first of all to not overreact with single quarter, especially given the strong margin performance we had last year, if you recall we grew about 70 basis. We certainly can expand margin and drive top tier growth. We have done it in the past and in fact our long term guidance assumes that we\u2019re going to do it in the future. But the race is clearly on for us and on our competitors to fortify and expand our positions in these fast growing and highly contested emerging markets and so we have chosen to reinvest some of the upside that we have got in the EU and North America to strengthen our position in these emerging markets and stage our future sustainable growth. I want to remind you though that these investments are all built into our guidance and we\u2019re still in that guidance calling for a double digit increase in operating EPS. So net-net there does not need to be a trade-off, there does need to be a balance and I think we\u2019re striking the appropriate balance.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Thank you and then just last one, the increase reinvestment that you\u2019re doing I assume that\u2019s meant to be part of the on-going base, going forward as opposed to sort of a onetime increase in investment. I\u2019m just thinking about next year as you lap some of this higher spending and then what I guess potentially could also be a higher tax rate how that flows into \u201814?","Dave Brearton","Yes it is part of a base, again I wouldn\u2019t overreact to one quarter. We have given guidance on the year of a $1.55 to a $1.60, we kept to that range we are going to need to see significant progress in our OI. Obviously quarter one isn't typical of the year for a lot of reasons we talked about but we\u2019re on track with the guidance we gave for the year, so the investments were already assumed within that guidance and I think the key really is you need to see the revenue growth pick up at the back half, so if we deliver that top-line guidance at the back-half and then that will drop to the bottom but this isn't a one time or where you need to worry about as you look at 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","I just wanted to follow-up first on Andrew\u2019s question regarding the tax rate going forward, Dave can you just give us an update on where we stand for full year tax rate guidance and then given that the realization of onetime items seem have set the bar fairly low this year. As we think forward to 2014, 2015 and what you would consider normalized tax rate, how should we think about the risk that this could potentially impact your ability to constant currency EPS targets over the next year or two.","Dave Brearton","Okay as we said we\u2019re $0.09 favorable in the quarter but seven of that was from discreet items the other two sets was the base tax and that was already built in the guidance. So that $0.07 is favorable in the year and that would drop our tax rate from around 20% to sort of the high side to mid-teens within that mid-teens range and we would expect if I sit here today for that to drop sort on in the year. So you\u2019re right we have a lower tax rate this year that we originally anticipated.","As we look into the next year, we have given you a long term tax rate of 25% and that\u2019s nothing more than the mathematical average of the statutory tax rate throughout the globe, that\u2019s still the right long term tax rate but I think as we\u2019re working through the impacts of the spend and how our capital structure will evolve with that over time and we unwind something\u2019s, it's going to take us two or three years to get there. So I think I\u2019m looking as I sit here today a 2014 probably being closer to the 20% we are originally targeting this year. So there will be a headwind but it's not going to be big as you\u2019re probably worried about and it's probably going to be at that 20% rate plus or minus the points or two for the next two or three years before we start to see it migrate up to that 25%. So I hope that helps.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Thanks Dave and then sorry just kind of phasing of first half sales growth, can you help us think a little bit more about any discreet impacts that would weigh on second quarter organic sales growth because your guidance seems to imply stronger organic sales in the first quarter versus the second quarter despite having a much tougher prior year comparison. Are there any other factors besides what you called out explicitly in the presentation?","Irene Rosenfeld","In fact we actually have a easier comp in the back half if you look at the year ago base but I think there are a couple of ways to think about it, if you exclude the coffee and capacity constraints that we talked about we\u2019re already in the mid-five and so we\u2019re quite comfortable that the underlying business and I talk a lot about the underlying quality of our results. We\u2019re quite comfortable that the underlying quality of our business is quite strong and we feel quite confident about the back half of the year. We have got the solid underlying moment driven by good share performance, solid volume mix performance, strong performance, solid volume mix performance, strong performance of our power brands. Our categories continue to grow. We will be lapping the coffee pricing. Our new production capacity will come on stream. And then as I mentioned of course we have got low comps in the back half of the year. So, net-net, we are quite confident that the back half will accelerate and that we will deliver the guidance at the low end of the 5% to 7% range for the full year.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks Irene. And I apologize, one very quick clarification. For the first quarter was there any Easter timing benefit that would have resulted in \u2013 that would have flattered the rate of organic sales growth?","Dave Brearton","Not really, because Easter was really early last year, it was a little earlier this year, but given the time that we have to shift to our customers it really didn\u2019t move any volume into Q1. As you look into 2014, you will see a shift between quarter one and quarter two as it goes back to normal timing, but this year versus last year not really. We had a big plus last year, this year it\u2019s kind of neutral.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks again everyone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Good evening everyone. You made a reference to potential volatility in global markets as one of the reasons that you wanted to keep your powder dry with the guidance for this year. Could you maybe talk a little bit about where your biggest concerns are around that and has that got worse over the course of the last couple of months?","Dave Brearton","There is nothing really specific. I mean, the reason we kept half of it in reserve is basically because it\u2019s only quarter one. And we are a global company. We operate in a lot of markets, where there is a lot going on. We are in Nigeria, Egypt, all parts of the GCC, Argentina, Venezuela, these are all sizable businesses, which we are doing very well in but stuff could happen. So, I mean, it\u2019s not a specific risk. Frankly, even on the tax line, we had discrete items go in our favor. We could have discrete items go against us. So, it\u2019s more a question of just being prudent. At this point in the year, there is nothing specific that I would call out and worry about. It\u2019s just being prudent given we are really only talking about the first quarter right now.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Thank you. And then maybe as a follow-up, you mentioned that India managed to grow low double-digits despite the capacity constraints in chocolate, was that driven by Oreos and Tang and they are launched I guess almost a couple of years ago now. Does that mean that India is almost $1 billion business now that those new businesses or new product launches have hit our run rate of about $100 million also, just want to make sure I got the math right on that?","Irene Rosenfeld","Actually no, Alexia, the bulk of our growth in India was driven by chocolate. As Dave mentioned, we took a number of steps. We are short on capacity, but we took a number of steps to stretch the capacity that we have got and we are continuing to push as we bring that capacity on stream for the back half of the year. We have high expectations for Oreo in India, but frankly, that\u2019s still a very small business and we will see that play out as the year progresses and then into next year.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, thank you very much.","Irene Rosenfeld","Okay.","David Brearton","It\u2019s about an $800 million business right now. So, it\u2019s in that range. While we have been growing nicely, the currency has been moving against us, so it has naturally moved much in reported U.S. dollars.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Got you. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from (indiscernible) of Jeffries.","Unidentified Analyst","Good evening. Irene, I am a little bit surprised that gum continues to drive down results in developed markets, I understand it\u2019s structurally challenged category, but at what point \u2013 and you only expect improvement two, three years from now, but at what point do you expect at least stabilization?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, as I mentioned, we are not taking this sitting down. We continue to test the number of initiatives and we got a number of ideas out in the marketplace. I mentioned the areas that we are focused on price size architecture, hard hitting advertising focused on more functional benefits like oral care. We are making great progress in driving placement of high-impact displays in markets like Japan, for example. We have got about 13,000 convenience stores that now have countertop displays and we are seeing a 20% to 25% uplift there. And lastly the most important action is getting the right product assortment at retail. And as I mentioned that\u2019s an area that we have been focused on. It does depend on when our customers reset their shelves. But we are starting to see some early signs of success and as we look at markets like the U.S., for example, you will not have seen the April shares yet, but when you see them you will see where our share is up about almost 2 points. So, we are starting to see some impact from these actions. I have great confidence that they will start to turn the tide, but most importantly, I want to make it clear that said a couple of times that we are not counting on that turnaround in the guidance that we have given.","Unidentified Analyst","And then maybe if I can ask one more question you mentioned capacity constraints in several markets and two quarters to go we had pricing issues and markets like Russia and Brazil. Do you feel like at least in some markets you have a management issue.","Irene Rosenfeld","No I think we talked about the fact that we were slow to respond in Russia and I\u2019m quite pleased with the turnaround that we have now seen in the Russian market and we talked about those results, they are quite strong if you look at them in aggregate it's only up about 2% but it's quite a sequential improvement from where we were and underneath that very strong volume mix and response to the initiatives that we have put in there and so I feel quite comfortable with the teams that we have got, we have some capacity issues and as I mentioned (inaudible) these capacity issues you might say how could you not have known but before we bought Cadbury in the effort example it was growing about 10%, we increased our marketing support, we saw it roll 20% - 30% and by the time we finished our programming it was growing 40% and so despite our most aggressive assumptions about growth in markets like India we just underestimated it. We\u2019re on track to bring that new capacity on stream, mid-year into the back half of the year but it's one of those nice problems to have and as we said the major impact, the major dampening impact on our first half results is coffee pricing. So yes capacity plays an impact but the major effect has been coffee pricing and a decline that we have taken there in response to the input cost.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","First question just Dave on the Venezuela, the currency hitting Venezuela, is it a write-down of just cash that was sitting on the bank, just what\u2019s the nature of sort of the hit that you took in the P&L?","Dave Brearton","Yes that\u2019s part of it, I mean there is really three pieces to the Venezuela impact two of them we called out the currency impact one of them we are just saying is regular operating. So, the net monetary assets as you rightly state we are on hyperinflation accounting as is everybody else. So we have to write those down and that was written down and we are calling that part of that $0.04 impact and obviously the Venezuelan bolivar earnings we make get translated back at a less favorable exchange rate so that\u2019s the second, so those are both in the $0.04. There is other impacts around the input cost just went up a lot based on the currency shift, so it cost a lot more to bring stuff into the country. We have got a price with some liquidity problems with customers, we\u2019re having to push through stuff, all of that is just regular operating and we\u2019re covering that because it's regular part of our business.","So the pieces that are in the $0.04 I really just go to the write-down and the dollar translation.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And so as we kind of model it going forward assuming that there wasn\u2019t another devaluation like the level of impact should lessen as we go through the rest of the year?","Dave Brearton","Yes in fact those two items really should be, the biggest chunk was the non-monetary asset write-down and that is onetime item so the translation is much lesser than impact.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then I guess just one another question and maybe it's a follow-up to Andrew\u2019s question Irene but I think there has been a lot written in the last six weeks about kind of what Mondelez should do in the future and whether it's merge with Frito Lay or focus more on margin expansion and there has been quite a bit of scrutiny just on what are the level of overhead that Mondelez is too high, you know certainly you\u2019re investing more right now and actually trying to build out infrastructure and markets where it sounds like it's pretty competitive to get the rate of investment or get the investments ahead of your competitor. So can you just talk to that topic you know kind of how you feel about the strategy you have now, the goals you have now? Why they are the right ones? And just kind to talk to this debate I guess that\u2019s going on in the market.","Irene Rosenfeld","There is no question of profits shattered out there and I\u2019m not going to comment on the shatter but what I will tell you is we have created a very unique business with tremendous opportunities for growth as we watch consumer demand for snacks growing at a very healthy rate around the world, and we capitalize on our strong positions, especially in these emerging markets. Again, one of the premises for the split of our company was the opportunity to focus on snacking and to leverage our position in these emerging markets. We are driving shareholder returns, we will drive shareholder returns by focusing on top-tier revenue and EPS growth, but that does not preclude margin expansion. So, we will continue to see top and bottom line growth, while at the same time we will see margin expansion.","As we said before, the margin opportunities are clearly bigger in North America and Europe and we are going to take some of that money to go drop some of that to the bottom line and we will take some of that to reinvest, but all of that investment is captured in our guidance that we have given, and it will still enable us to deliver double-digit EPS growth. We do believe though that these emerging markets that the time is now to make sure that we fortify our positions in these rapidly growing markets and that\u2019s why we are chosen to do that.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Has that urgency to step up the investment in emerging markets intensified at all over the last year?","Irene Rosenfeld","No, in fact I would say it was one of the main reasons for excluding the company. It was our opportunity to focus exclusively on using that opportunity to expand our position. So, it was very much a part of our overall thesis. It will pay dividends. I know it is challenging to see the impact of these investments at this point, because of some of the headwinds we have talked about. But you will start to see it play through in the back half of the year and it certainly will play through in the sustainable growth that we will generate.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good evening everybody.","Dave Brearton","Hi Eric.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Couple of questions I guess following up on Bryan\u2019s point, I think on the devaluation isn\u2019t it most of the time that companies will take the write-down of the assets and the hyperinflation into something like between operating income and pretax as opposed to the segment. It appears that you are putting the full impact into the segment, is that accurate?","Dave Brearton","Yeah, I think it is accurate. We called it the currency impact and I think that is consistent with what I have seen other companies do, but we did leave it within the Latin America segment. And that\u2019s why you see the operating income margin, because on a reported basis, it\u2019s within operating income and it shows there as a significant write-down. So, yes, it\u2019s in that segment.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","So, is there other devaluation such as Argentina that are material that\u2019s also going to run through your segment line as opposed to after EBIT?","Dave Brearton","Yeah, it would flow through the segment line. Venezuela is the only material country that\u2019s on hyperinflation. So, the write-down of net monetary assets really is the unique Venezuela issue unless inflation gets high enough in places like Argentina to get us in the hyperinflation, but as of today, we are still at normal accounting.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And the next question I think Dave you said that there was a 50 basis point drag due to a lack of capacity I guess focused in EM, and that was less than you expected, is that accurate?","Dave Brearton","Yeah, yeah, back in CAGNY, we had estimated that the capacity constraints would tamper our growth by up to a full point. It\u2019s down to about half a point mostly because we have spent a lot of effort with the supply chain folks. Stretching the capacity getting some efficiencies and de-bottlenecking, but also frankly only selling the skews that matter and really focusing on fewer skews and fewer changeovers. So, that help us stretch it out and got the impact down to about half a point. As Irene mentioned, we would expect even that impact to disappear in the back half of the year, because we have got the new lines coming on. We have got some comments stepping up, and we would expect that impact to disappear for the back half.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","So, to get to the second half acceleration, which arguably has to be sales growth of, let\u2019s call it, 6%, 7%, the drag has to go obviously from not being a drag to a contribution. So, could you kind of give a sense as to how much capacity is actually being added that will, let\u2019s say, bridge the gap versus to get to such a fast growth rate, like if you shift to consumption, how much is that going to really add?","Dave Brearton","Yes, if we shift to consumption, it really is only that half point. We are going to be putting in more capacity, because frankly we want to get ahead of it, and that\u2019s why we talked about in CAGNY we\u2019re going to step up our capital expenditures closure to the 5% revenue for the next couple of years. So we\u2019re going to try to get in front of it but adding more capacity can\u2019t help me so that\u2019s where the consumption. So we will get the half point back. I think as you get into the back half I mean there is few things to think about, the coffee headwind was 1.3 points this quarter and probably similar next quarter that\u2019s going to disappear in the back half. The capacity is half a point that\u2019s going to disappear in the back half. If you added those on along you\u2019re already up to mid-five and on top of that we got good underlying share momentum, it's probably the best we have seen in years, vol mix is very strong, categories are growing, a little less than historically but still very strong growth in our categories and frankly we have pretty easy comp periods in the back half as well. So to add all that together getting to that six to seven range we\u2019re pretty confident.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay and then on the guidance so are you saying that with currency where it is today even I guess including currency of a $0.03 headwind did also including the benefit of the taxes assuming you spent back half that you\u2019re not actually changing guidance?","Dave Brearton","Well we have gone through a mechanism of giving you guidance on a constant current basis of the entire year average rates and I\u2019m giving you sensitivity around that. We did increase that constant currency guidance by $0.03 to the taxes and passing through half of that discreet benefit that\u2019s true, it is a total coincidence but today I spot currency would be a $0.03 headwind and would bring us back down that $0.03 but I think it's only May 7, so I won't overreact to the currency markets. They will be what they will be and will give you a sensitivity every quarter as to how that stands as we get closer to the end of the year we will be able to lock in at a firm number but we will give you a constant currency guidance and we will give you a sensitivity every quarter based on where we sit today.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay and then last question I apologize Irene, you know obviously you know at least in China bid market Mars has something like 40% to 50% of the chocolate market over there, lot of other players fighting it out. You\u2019re trying to be aggressive by getting your fair share as quickly as possible. But why shouldn\u2019t be concerned that those were fighting it out are going to struggle with returns I mean Hershey has already kind of backed off a little bit on their long term assumptions about operating margins in their emerging markets. So I guess why isn't going to be a pretty big challenge for all these chocolate players to try to capture profitability in the market?","Irene Rosenfeld","We\u2019re not in chocolate in China, so our category participation in China is primarily biscuits and then we have overweighed gum and as I talked earlier we feel very good about the biscuit performance, we continue to have the number one biscuits in the country and Oreo growth continues to be very solid and biscuit grew double digit in the first quarter, our overall China business is about a $1 billion it grew about 20% and the incremental benefit there came from gum. As you recall last August we launched Stride gum in China. China is the second largest gum market in the world, it's growing 16% annually and every time I see talking about challenges in gum it's in the developed markets, developing markets are growing at quite healthy rate and China is one of them and I would say our early results we feel quite good about our early results, we have got a share about 5% share and it's certainly performing consistent with our expectations and we view this entry as very complimentary to our biscuit business because in effect we\u2019re basically putting gums on top of the biscuit infrastructure.","So we feel quite good about the performance of our business in China today, we continue to make investments in route to market, in expanding our participating in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities investing in more in the traditional trade all of which have very attractive paybacks because our gross margins in China are quite good, in fact they are among the highest in the world. So China is a strong market for us, it has performed well. We have every confidence it will continue to perform well and we will invest behind that growth to fuel the overall momentum.","Dave Brearton","Hey guys let me just step in here, we can just keep the number of questions like 1 or 1.5 per person, wouldn\u2019t try to get to everybody as much as we can. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Hi, good afternoon and good evening. Just had a question for you, in the quarter, were your input costs favorable to the gross margin? So, were input costs actually deflationary in the quarter overall? I am guessing with coffee being down, there was a big driver, I am just curious overall?","Dave Brearton","No. Actually, our input cost overall were up about 1%, so pretty small, and coffee is the reason they were small. Within our input cost, commodities are clearly one of the drivers but as the global company now actually bigger driver is currency rates and the cost of cost to bring materials into the individual markets where we sell, and a lot of other minor raw materials that we buy locally. So, commodity costs, they are by far not our biggest piece. If I looked at those, you are right, they are slightly down, but the overall aggregate input cost was up about 1%, probably the lowest inflation we have seen in quite a while, but it was a slight increase.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. And then I just had a quick follow-on question to that. Are you seeing markets where it\u2019s getting more promotional in some of your categories, and also kind of pushing towards gum, is that a category where you also are getting more promotional even sequentially to try and turn that category around?","Dave Brearton","Yeah, I don\u2019t think we are seeing a material change in the promotional activity. Markets have been kind of in the 1st of June state in the developed world for quite a while. And we have maintained our discipline; I think most of the food industry did. Gum, there has been more promotion. We talked about that in Europe and we are responding to that, but that\u2019s really more of an isolated circumstance. I would not say promotional intensity has increased at this stage.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hi, good afternoon. To follow-up on Matt Grainger\u2019s question, I think he was asking about the second quarter, not necessarily the second half, and I am curious about this too. I am still not sure I understand. To get to your guidance of 3.5% organic growth in the first half, you have to put out a lower organic growth number in 2Q than 1Q. And I guess I am not sure why that is, right. You have a much easier comparison. There is no change in the coffee impact. There is no Easter issue. So, again, maybe you have talked about this, but are there some headwinds I am not necessarily thinking about that hit your top line this current period?","Dave Brearton","I think we are talking about 20 to 30 basis points gap. So, I mean simplistically, we gave you guidance of 3.5% for the first half. 3.8% is above that, but not materially above that. We left the guidance for the first half at 3.5%, I wouldn\u2019t over-think it.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Alright. It implies 3.2%, then some people would call that meaningful, but I will move on. As you look at your \u2013 Dave, as you look at your weighted average interest rate, it\u2019s high versus the group, right. It's the second highest of any company that covering. You have talked in the past about a lot of your debt being non-callable, and of course, the high cash cost associated with restructuring that debt and I understand that. I guess, I am just curious if maybe you can update us on your current thoughts and whether they have changed at all regarding \u2013 at least on the outside seems it to be arguably a less than optimal debt structure?","Dave Brearton","Yes, the interest costs are very high. I mean, all of that debt was taken out really for the Danone acquisition and the Cadbury acquisition. So, they were taken out at a time at the time when (indiscernible) was reasonable and today it looks high. We paid off some debt in February as we have scheduled. We said we would pay-off the February debt that\u2019s done. We said we would pay off the May debt. There is a $1 billion coming due actually tomorrow. So, that we paid off. And that will give us down to about sort of $17.5 billion debt level that we said was kind of our equilibrium. There is another $1.8 billion that is due in October. And we are obviously evaluating options for that. As you think about tenders or other things that we would buyback some of that high cost debt, the reality is it\u2019s pay me now or pay me later. I could buy it back, but I am going to have to pay the bondholders, the net present value of that high interest cost. So, the criteria I have established with my treasury group is it needs to be net present value positive for it to be worth a while to do with that buyback, and that means that it continues to be the criteria. That doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t do it, it doesn\u2019t mean we will but that\u2019s the test that will continue to apply. And yeah, we haven\u2019t executed a tender so far, but if we decide that the economics actually work in our favor at some point, we will move forward.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Well, I appreciate that and I will let it go in one second, I would just suggest that perhaps shareholders should come first right? Stockholders come before, bondholders in this kind of situation and if you can drive your EPS significantly higher by paying down some or by restructuring some debt which you probably could and we would exclude the expenses as non-recurring on at least from our vantage point if you can get your stock higher and do an awful lot of things with that in terms of acquisitions and so forth, just my friendly $0.02 there.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer of UBS.","David Palmer \u2013 UBS","I would love to dig into the puts and takes in the quarter with regard to margins. It sounds like global chocolate and biscuits had a solid revenue quarter with relatively higher margin power brands doing significantly better than those categories and you mentioned that the overall inflation of your inputs about 1%. Obviously gum was weak and that\u2019s a high margin business and you had a tougher margin comparison this quarter but is there any more detail you can give us with regard to margin drags or reinvestments that happen in the quarter that seem to offset this other areas that would speak to tail winds. Thanks.","Dave Brearton","I guess that type of thing wouldn\u2019t overreact to margins at single quarter and particularly to this quarter had a lot of noise in it. We came off the year when we grew margins by 70 basis points we had a very strong year and I think this year in total we still expect to have a good year. At start and look at our margins, our gross margins were flat and at 37.2% and you rightly point out gum actually hit us within that because gum is a higher margin product by about 50 basis points. We also have the price adjustments we made in Eastern Europe and Russia that is as well and we covered that. But continue to be pretty discipline around pricing and input cost and productivity and the rest of the world. So the flat margin really is a decline in a couple of situations but overall continued progress on gross margins. The reason the OI margin was down was as I said on the call it was the Venezuelan bolivar with a onetime impact this year it was prior year items that kind of setup in artificially high base support (inaudible) that we talked about last year. It was this synergies, we haven't talked about the synergies much but we said we had $200 million of the synergies coming out of the spin and we said we would eliminate half of that this year which we will but inevitably the savings are going to come out more towards the back half and the full impact of those synergies hit us in the first quarter and it was the investments in emerging markets that we talked about in A&C and sales and route to market.","So those are kind of the drivers, as I look at bucket of events we\u2019re holding gross margins despite some headwinds and we would expect to continue to do that. We will continue to invest in our emerging market growth, the dis-synergies will disappear so we\u2019re on track to hit our total year guidance and I\u2019m not worried about the first quarter, I know it looks bad on paper and it is in isolation, it clearly is but I think you will see that margin pick up more in the back half less over in the second quarter but I think the back half margins will improve significantly and you will see that in delivery of the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","On gross margins you said price growth of around 1.3, inflation of 1, mathematically that alone should have given you some margin expansion adding volume leverage and then your productivity. Mathematically we should have seen much better gross margins. I think you gave 50 basis points offset on gum weakness, can you help illuminate us to what the other offsets were?","Dave Brearton","Yes the other two big offsets would be the coffee and chocolate pricing adjustment we did in Western and Eastern Europe and it would also be the Argentinian price controls, where inflation is running significantly higher than the price controls right now. We haven't been able to take any pricing this year. Those will be the two biggest offsets plus the gum.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","So the coffee it's not included in your inflation and price numbers for the overall company?","Dave Brearton","The coffee pricing we\u2019re managing fairly well so coffee pricing is down, coffee margins are okay.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","And this is my other half question, you gave A&C of 9.6% of revenue for this quarter, what was it last year?","Dave Brearton","9.4.","Operator","Your final question comes from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Driscoll \u2013 Citi","Great. Thank you for getting me in there, feel like I got into the wire although it\u2019s past the hour. I want to make one clarification. When you guys were saying that OI was in line with your expectation and it allowed the SG&A reinvestment, at least I think I have that correct. And then this tax benefit, the zero tax paid in the quarter you are saying that, that\u2019s not the reason for the SG&A investment that this is outside of that and then you are talking about part of this then gets contributed to the guidance race, did I say that about right?","Dave Brearton","Yeah, you do. Again, we gave full year guidance, and on a full-year basis, we expect our EPS to be $1.55 to $1.60 and that will be well into double-digit EPS growth. Within that, we have got the tax benefit that we dropped $0.02 to $0.03 and we have got OI that\u2019s going to have to grow. So, we gave a full year estimate on OI growth and our top line behind that. It is going to require margin improvement. We never gave you operating margin guidance for quarter one. So, quarter one was in line with what we would expect internally. We knew about the one-time hits we have, and we knew about the investments we will be making all through the year, but the fact that those will hit us more in the first quarter, because we don\u2019t have that revenue leverage yet. And so it\u2019s more about as we go through the year, we get the top line growth accelerating. That will translate into leverage down through the P&L. You will see that margin gain come through. And so that\u2019s why the quarter one margin in isolation is not great. And it\u2019s certainly below what you guys would have expected. It is part of a full year guidance and there is nothing in there that should it will be concerned about the full year. It really consistent with the guidance we gave back in February.","David Driscoll - Citi","Very helpful. On China, the 20% growth is pretty encouraging do you think that type of growth rate can be sustained throughout the remaining quarters of the year?","Irene Rosenfeld","Simple answer is yes, David, I mean probably not exactly at 20%, but we have been growing healthily at those rates for the last couple of years. And I have every expectation. We have got good category growth. We are in good categories in the country. I talked about the performance of both biscuits and gum. We feel we think it\u2019s very strong performance there. We have seen some slowdown in GDP, but it has not disproportionately affected our categories. Even biscuit when it slowed down grew at a healthy 11% rate over the last 52 weeks. So, our share performance continues to be strong. We have got strong brands in both our biscuits and in our gum portfolios, and we continue to make investments as I mentioned in marketing support, in route to market as well as in broadening our distribution base. So, I feel quite confident about the future and the fact that China will continue to be a key contributor to our overall growth rate.","David Driscoll - Citi","That\u2019s terrific. Can I switch over to just two final questions? One, there are two good ones, they are really good ones, the new products, we don\u2019t hear from you guys about like new products as a percentage of revenues and this I think is a key metric that you look at internally. Can you update us on your thoughts on new products as a percent of revenues? And the final question is Dave, maybe you can just give us some understanding as to what\u2019s the holdup with the arbitration proceedings with Starbucks, hasn\u2019t it been like 10 or 11 months since we have gone through this thing and why aren\u2019t we getting a verdict?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, I\u2019ll let Dave answer that one and I will come back to your question about innovation.","Dave Brearton","Yeah, on Starbucks we remain pretty confident in our case. We are looking forward to the verdict as much as you are, probably more than you are. There is really nothing new since our last call. We are awaiting the decision. You are correct the arbitration hearing is finished in August of last year, but there is no specific timing. It\u2019s really at the discretion of the arbiter. So, we are pretty confident in the outcome. We are pretty confident in the merits of our case, but we can\u2019t (indiscernible).","Irene Rosenfeld","With respect to innovation, David, we feel pretty good about the performance of our innovation, particularly our global platforms, it represents about 12% or 13% of revenue, and we believe that\u2019s quite high relative to peers and the drivers of that within each of the categories are the platform innovations behind each of our power brands. And so as I talked about the performance of power brands and I talked about Cadbury Dairy Milk or Milka growth, it\u2019s coming because of products like Bubbly. When I talk about biscuit growth, it\u2019s coming from Oreo and belVita, for example. And when we talk about our gum growth we are seeing continued improvement as we focus our Trident franchise on breathe freshening. So, that\u2019s the source of this innovation. It is an important contributor to our overall top line growth and we have seen continued strength in our performance.","Dexter Congbalay","Thanks everybody.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations of Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.","Shep Dunlap","Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO.","Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors. During this call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","As we discuss our results today, unless noted \u2013 as reported, we\u2019ll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","In today\u2019s call, Dirk will give you an overview of our results as well as a progress update against our strategic priorities. Then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We\u2019ll close with Q&A.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dirk.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon, everybody. I will start off on Slide 4, called delivering long-term shareholder value creation. 2019 was a great year for Mondelez International. It was the first full year under our new consumer centric growth strategy. And we delivered strong results on the top and the bottom line, while generating significant free cash flow. Our solid execution and targeted investments in both our global and local brands enabled us to meet or exceed all of our financial targets for the year. These results give us increasing conviction that our strategy will create a sustained momentum in our business, allowing us to deliver on our long-term financial targets in the years to come.","Switching to Slide 5, recapping the year, here are a few highlights. We delivered organic net revenue growth of 4.1%, which was broad based across geographies and brands, and was driven by both volume and pricing. In terms of geographies, emerging markets growth was strong, growing mid-single digit in ex-Argentina and driven primarily by key geographies like China, Russia and India, but also by emerging high growth markets in Southeast Asia. Developed markets showed robust growth with both Europe and North America performing well, delivering share gains and driving category growth.","Overall, the results reflect the quality of our brand portfolio with our unique combination of both global and local brands benefiting from increased and targeted investments throughout the year. Our adjusted EPS growth was more than 8% for the year, and we are pleased with our full year free cash flow generation of about $3 billion, which was well ahead of our outlook.","Switching to Slide 6, our strategy is now well embedded in the business. In the past 12 months, we\u2019ve made great strides in implementing it across the different business units. The rollout of the new strategy was reinforced by our new way of incentivizing our teams, assuring that everybody\u2019s clear on what is important. At its core, we are constantly trying to be more consumer centric using our new and unique understanding of consumers around the world to develop a more effective and a more consistent approach to marketing. And as a consequence, growth in our global brands has accelerated further, while our local brand growth is now very close to overall category growth.","We\u2019ve also invested in further growth in non-grocery channels like discounters, e-commerce and convenience, as well as in expanding our distribution in fast-growing, developing markets like China, India and Russia.","As it relates to innovation, we are becoming more agile and faster trying many new ideas, and in fact, rolling out fewer initiatives, but with bigger success. We are clear to that strategy only succeeds with outstanding execution. And while we still have a long way to go, I credit a big part of our results to better execution in our commercial as well as our supply chain operations. North America supply chain in 2019 definitely showed significant improvement. Our European teams executed against the seasonal opportunity like Easter and Christmas better than in recent years and our teams in India and China reached the highest level of execution in store as well as in the plants.","However, the opportunity to constantly improve our execution remains significant, as our recent struggles with our supply chain in Brazil would indicate. As it relates to our operating costs while we are in the first place trying to leverage volume growth to a lower delivered cost per ton. We still see significant opportunity to optimize many other cost areas. While more and better marketing as well as strongly improved execution have driven our 2019 results, a shift in mindset around the company, also has had an important impact. The most important part of the shift was driven by our local first approach, basically empowering local business units to make the right choices for their consumers and their clients. This empowerment has led to clearer accountability and faster decision-making and was reinforced by focused incentives.","I am proud of how the teams have embraced this new culture and really believe that this model has great potential for the future. While we are talking about culture, I\u2019d also like to mention a change in the leadership of our Latin American region. We are announcing today that Gustavo Valle will join us as Region President, Latin America, effective February 1st. Gustavo comes from Danone, where he\u2019s held numerous positions around the globe. In his last role, he was leading the global dairy and plant based division. Earlier in his career, he managed the Argentina and Brazilian business, and brings with him significant experience in the volatile economies of Latin America. I look forward to working with Gustavo again.","Switching to Slide 7. While we are excited about our financial results and prospects in today\u2019s world, any consumer business needs to have as strong as social and environmental agenda as a financial agenda. Our own employees as well as our consumers demand it and customers, investors and other stakeholders expect it. So, I\u2019m happy to say that in 2019, we have made great progress in embedding our purpose to empower people to snack right. We announced the new sustainable snacking strategy with new goals and stronger commitments. In cocoa, our biggest commodity, we are committing to sourcing the equivalent of 100% of the cocoa we need for our chocolate brands through our Cocoa Life program by 2025.","Today, I am proud to share that we\u2019ve achieved 63% by the end of 2019 and increased from 43% in 2018 and with a clear roadmap for the remainder. Earlier this year, we joined other major companies in renewing our commitment to the Paris climate accord and have set our path towards further reduction in carbon emissions. Looking towards the consumer, we\u2019re focused on making the packaging for all our products 100% recyclable by 2025. And by the end of 2019, we are already at 92% with some interesting trials underway to unlock the remaining 8% of that journey.","Finally, as it relates to the mindful enjoyment of our products, we are committed to increasing our mix of portion controlled packs to 20% of our total revenues. We\u2019re well underway with 15% already sold in such formats. We know that our future growth and success as a company depends on ensuring people and planet thrive, and we are committed to tracking and reporting on our progress and impact transparently along the way. I look forward to sharing more with you in 2020.","and with that, I will now hand it over to Luca.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Dirk and good afternoon. on the slide 9, is our financial performance for both quarter four and full year. We ended 2019 strongly, continuing the momentum were created since the beginning of our new strategic plan. This is the case as this relates to organic top-line growth that translated into earnings growth and free cash flow. We believe these outcomes to be high quality. revenue growth was broad-based by region, global and local brands and in terms of developed and emerging markets.","As a matter of fact, 12 out of the 13 business units delivered growth in 2019. importantly, there was a good balance of volume and pricing, both of which are important. Volume allowing us to leverage the great infrastructure we have created with much work over the last few years and pricing to drive value. This balance results in top-line drove attractive profit dollar growth while enabling reinvestments in our brands.","in Q4 and throughout 2019, we also made significant investments in area like Europe and AMEA to further support our brands and broader growth initiatives as well as in the biscuits category, North America and certain markets in Latin America. These investments were in line with our original plan and a bit higher in certain areas and delivered unexpected returns and share gains.","Turning to slide 10. overall, we grew 4.1% in both Q4 and in 2019. We deliver strong volume and pricing led growth in virtually all key emerging markets like China, India, Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico and Africa. In aggregate, emerging markets grew approximately 8% for both the year and the quarter. excluding inflation-driven growth in Argentina, emerging markets grew 6% for the year. These results support our conviction that our emerging market footprint is a competitive advantage and the investments we have been making in 2019 and previous years are paying off.","Developed markets also delivered solid results for the year and quarter with revenue growth of approximately 2%, driven by improved results out of both Europe and North America. We share gains in both regions. as we said in previous calls, particularly in Europe, these results were aided by longer Easter season and the milder summer than 2018.","now, let\u2019s review our profitability performance on slide 11. We increased gross profit by 4% for the full year and 4.4% in Q4. This gross profit dollar increase enabled a step-up in growth investments, focused on working media and route-to-market capabilities. We also drove solid OI dollar improvement with volume leverage, pricing and cost savings partially offset by growth investments.","Moving to regional performance sounds like 12 for the full year. Europe executed very well for the year with 3.7% revenue growth. These results include strong volume-driven growth in developed markets such as the UK and Germany, which grew mid-single digit as well as Russia, which posted double-digit growth for the full year behind strong volumes and share gains. We deliver consistent execution in chocolate and seasonals throughout the year and the strong execution resulted both in share gains, particularly in our chocolate business and good category growth.","Adjusted OI dollars grew by almost 6% in spite of significant investment in areas like A&C. EU shows the full potential of our mobile as we drove solid volume-driven market growth, gained share and delivered strong gross profit progression that allowed for A&C step-up. AMEA grew 5.3%, showing continuous trend across much of the region. India grew double-digit behind another year of strong execution and investment. We continue to help drive the chocolate market, while making progress against our work plans of building a larger biscuit platform. China grew high-single digits for the year driven by strength in both biscuits and gum and great execution in both e-commerce as well as the offline channels. Southeast Asia grew mid-single digit with solid results in biscuits and chocolate.","EMEA increased operating income dollars by more than 9% due to leverage from top line growth. This growth comes despite some significant investments in A&C and route-to-market. The limited OI growth in Q4 is entirely due to additional investments in A&C. And those were enabled by continued strong gross profit growth that we saw throughout the whole year. Again, our algorithm is working quite well in this region.","Latin America grew 7.8%, due primarily to inflation driven growth in Argentina. Revenue increased 1.7% excluding Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single-digit driven by strong execution and share growth across most categories. In Brazil, we saw slight decline in revenue driven primarily by a reduction of trade stocks in powdered beverages, partially offset by lapping the general truckers strike in 2018. We are beginning to take actions in this category including the launch of new marketing communications and product formulations.","Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined by approximately 6%, primarily due to volume losses in powdered beverages in Brazil along with some remaining supply chain costs from our planned transition. We do not expect material planned transitional costs to continue in 2020. For the quarter, the significant growth in OI is due to lapping some one-timers related to Forex contracts settled in last year and some legal cases, while we are reassured by the solidity of the business in Mexico and the Western Indian region, and dealing well with the volatility of Argentina, we recognize there is more work to do in Brazil. And the focus of Gustavo and team will be mostly on that.","Finally, North America grew 2.2% for the full year and more than 3% in Q4, driven by improved volumes. We closed the year well and delivered strong share results in biscuit, with growth in a number of key brands including Oreo, Ritz and belVita. We continue to make investments in A&C and we are seeing our brands respond favorably, mainly when coupled with our excellent DSD execution. The North American region grow more than 6% for the year due to leverage, effective pricing and waste reduction, with additional A&C mostly in our biscuits brands. North America had strong gross profits delivered throughout the year and Q4 was no exception to that, but again, levers of A&C stepped up in Q4.","Turning to categories highlights. Our three snacking categories continued to demonstrate attractive growth. With total category growth of 3.6% for the year, we did see a more normalized growth in our categories for Q4 at 2.8% and some of the tailwinds that helped Q2 and Q3, and longer Easter in Q2 and the milder summer in both Q2 and Q3 subsided in the last part of the year.","However, we remain encouraged by the health of our categories and believe they can continue to sustain growth of around 3% over the long-term and this is what our long-term algorithm is predicated upon. There are a number of very significant areas, where we have drive the category growth in 2019, among those U.S. biscuit, where we continued to execute better marketing and execution at point of sales and where we draw both value and volume growth through DSD. UK, India and Russia chocolate, where our renewed marketing bundles on both global and local brands capital, coupled with sales excellence drove substantial value for the category.","Overall, we have or gained share in 75% of our business in 2019, which reflect the progress on our broader strategy of volume and share improvement. Overall, our share were up for the year in aggregate, ending several years of share losses. And we ended the year on an improved trajectory.","By category, our biscuit business grew 4.4%. Approximately 75% of our revenue grew or held share in this category including our U.S., China, Russia and India businesses. In chocolate, our business grew 5.8%. Approximately 85% of our revenue grew or held share, including the U.K., Australia and Russia. Gum and candy revenue grew slightly. About 35% of our revenue in this business gained or held share including strength in China and France gum and Russia candy.","Now turning to EPS on Slide 18. Full year EPS grew more than 8%. This growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results, income from JV equity stakes despite some tax wins in quarter, and lower than expected interest expense driven by accelerated cash flow, focused balance sheet management and favorable rate environment.","I\u2019ll now move on to our free cash flow results on Slide 19. We delivered full year free cash flow of $3 billion, which was about our outlook and nearly $200 million improvement over last year due to strong income, continued progress in our cash conversion cycle as well as lower cash restructuring and CapEx. On Page 20, we returned $3 billion to our shareholders for the full-year. This brings us to more than $24 billion in capital return since Mondelez was formed.","Now let me provide some details around our outlook for 2020. At the high level, we expect an our own algorithm year for 2020 in terms of our financial outlook. We expect organic net revenue growth of 3% plus. This is predicated on our view of category growth of approximately 3%, some share gains and revenue growth driven by both volume and pricing. We expect adjusted EPS in the high-single-digit range. This outlook implies continue growth of gross profit dollars and volume leverage. It also reflects another step-up in investments levels primarily in A&C and sales capabilities. To continue to support sustainable and high quality growth as well as some cost savings to fund incremental investments.","With respect to free cash flow, we are expecting approximately $3 billion. They call this outlook includes additional cash tax impact resulting from the U.S. tax reform. In this outlook we also expect our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low-to-mid-20s and interest expense of approximately $380 million. Although we do not provide a quarterly outlook on a key metrics, it is important to know that the following items in terms of phasing will impact 2020; both Easter and Chinese New Year for earlier this year when compared to 2019.","In terms of year-over-year comparisons, our commodity pipeline is relatively more unfavorable in the first part of the year versus the second part of the year, especially in the first quarter and we have covered most of the key commodities for 2020. We also feel good about overall levels of pricing in the plan.","With that, let\u2019s open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Good evening everybody.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi Andrew.","Luca Zaramella","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi. Just two for me. First, I\u2019d say obviously Mondelez had a much stronger than initially plan 2019 especially on organic sales growth. Company is looking for 3% plus in 2020, which is the long-term algorithm as you said, though obviously a deceleration from the 4% plus you showed in 2019. I was hoping you could talk a bit to this in terms of where or whether you\u2019re building in some conservatism there? Or if there\u2019s really something more specific behind it, whether it\u2019s, as you said, lapping a longer Easter and a hotter summer and things of that nature? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Yes, I think 2019 was a good year for us. We\u2019ve just went through the numbers, not only because of the numbers, but I think also that it was sort of the first confirmation that our strategy\u2019s working. This was the first year, full year with the new strategy for us. We saw a number of signs that we think will continue next year, like the volume growth, like solid gross profit and OI dollar growth, market share gains, continue cost discipline. It was, as you alluded, helped by later Easter season, which gives us work time in store and also that we left the very hot summer of 2018 in Europe in 2019. So we can see now the markets in the last quarter, where the categories were more than 2.8%, not around the 4% that they were in the middle of the year.","I think the unlock that we have, we will continue to work those out, put the consumer first, keep on focusing on our execution and keep on increasing our investments and keep on improving our marketing activating our local brand, so all of that will continue next year. And also what we have done as it relates to our responsibilities and goals and better alignment of our incentives, we\u2019re making a few more tweaks this year. And we have a number of issues that we need to solve, in the first place, Brazil supply chain, which is growing better, but also we have to pay attention to China for instance.","So all that, for us we are saying the markets or the categories we think will be around 3%, we see ourselves increasing our market share, and so we call it the 3% plus in line with our long-term algorithm. And it\u2019s the beginning of the year, we are always very thoughtful as we set our targets and we\u2019ll see how the first quarter goes. But at this stage, we feel that it\u2019s certainly not in our book slow down from this year, we continue as we are, but we do believe that the categories will be a little bit less than they were last year, because of the reasons that I said.","I think apart from the two watchouts that I mentioned, we see nothing at this stage that would particularly preoccupy us for the start of the year. So overall I would say, for us it\u2019s continued to strategy as we are. Yes, the numbers are a little bit less than they were in 2019, but that was largely driven by the structure of how things came about in 2019 and 2020 is a continuation of where we are.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. Thanks very much. I\u2019ll leave it there.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Lane with BOA.","Brian Lane","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Dirk Van de Put","Hey, Brian.","Luca Zaramella","Hey, Brian.","Brian Lane","Hi. So I guess, I wanted to pick up just on the expectation for incremental investment for 2020, so maybe just a couple of points around that. First, if you can kind of maybe size what the incremental investment in 2020 would be relative to what it was in 2019. And then I guess is we\u2019re thinking about the sources of that, would we \u2013 would it sort of suggest that you\u2019d have gross profit, dollar growth growing faster than operating profit growth because there\u2019s going to be some incremental investment in A&C, or am I not thinking about that correctly?","Dirk Van de Put","No, I think you\u2019re \u2013 well, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re thinking about it correctly, but let me start from the start. And so in 2019, our extra investment was about $150 million, largely focused on more A&C route-to-market as R&D. And we\u2019re going to be in the same ballpark in 2020 as extra investment. In 2019, we had plans that extra investment would have an impact on earnings. I don\u2019t know if you remember, we said we would be sort of around mid-single digit earnings. But then during the year, our sales came in better as expected. We generated more gross profits. And in the end, we were ending the year on an 8% EPS increase. However, we had Brazil that affected us in a way. And in fact, our gross profit could have grown more and we would have hoped to invest more in 2019.","So in 2020, the extra gross profit that we\u2019re adding is slightly higher than we did in 2019 in dollars. And we\u2019re flowing, let\u2019s say, 40% of that roughly into A&C and the other investment areas. So it\u2019s similar to what it was last year, but we don\u2019t have the negative effect of Brazil, and that\u2019s why we can continue with that algorithm and deliver high-single digit EPS growth.","Brian Lane","That\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of where geographically the spend is going to be, could you just maybe give us a little bit of color on kind of maybe where you emphasized the extra spend in 2019, and kind of where the incremental pieces going in 2020? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. It goes largely to \u2013 first of all, the two sources or the two destinations of the money is one in extra marketing and media investment, to be very specific, it\u2019s all in media. And the second part is in distribution expansion. So the extra media investment is a little bit across the board. In most countries, it\u2019s different level that we do that, but the idea is to continue increasing our media pressure. As it relates to the route-to-market that is more concentrated in the emerging markets, the India\u2019s, the China\u2019s, the Russia\u2019s, where we still have a huge opportunity to increase our distribution.","I would also like to add that, as it relates to those media investments, not only our rate increasing, the overall spend on A&C, but within that A&C we are shifting more into media. So we are increasing our working media spent largely through digital. And then also we constantly are trying to increase our ROI, which increased about 12% in 2019 on our media spend. So, and on top of that, we have restructured our agency. So we also think that our non-media spend will have higher efficiency and higher quality. So all that together, we have the effect of the higher investment, but also that re-shifting which has a pretty big effect on our media pressure. So that\u2019s a little bit how it all comes together.","Brian Lane","That\u2019s great. Thank you for that color.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay.","Operator","We will take our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey guys.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Dara Mohsenian","Obviously some pretty strong results in terms of organic sales growth in 2019, but within that we saw a really solid acceleration in volume growth. So I\u2019d love to hear a bit of a state of the union now that the full year results are in, what drove that in your mind, how sustainable that volume of pickup is going forward? You mentioned both volume mix and pricing will be up next year, is one a bigger driver of that organic sales growth than the other.","And then secondly on Brazil, have the supply chain issues \u2013 are those now been resolved and they\u2019re behind you? And maybe just give us a little more of an update on how you\u2019re managing the powdered beverage business, and if we should expect sequential improvement in the first half of the year versus the back half of last year, do those strategies take longer to play out? Thanks.","Luca Zaramella","Okay. I\u2019ll start and maybe, Dirk will cover a little bit, Brazil. So, as to volume, clearly, we like what we have seen. We like that top-line growth is coming mostly through a good balance of both volume and pricing. We believe that balance is quite important, because it allows us to create value in the marketplace, but at the same time, to have the leverage that we need for our algorithm to really fully work. It is pretty much across the board, maybe looking at the numbers you might say it is a little bit less in emerging markets, but when you strip out Argentina, you really see a good balance of volume and pricing even in emerging markets.","We keep on investing on our franchises, route-to-market in quality of our brands. And so we expect that to continue and we will always try to strike the right balance between pricing and volume. So, I don\u2019t think Q4 was a material exception through the rest of the year. I think the only one that came back in terms of volume growth in the second part of the year is North America. That is executing quite well behind biscuit, both in terms of marketing and I would say in terms of the execution. So, I think we will continue seeing that as we continue investing in our franchises. In Brazil, quite frankly, the supply chain issue is for the most part behind us, but there is more work to be done. And on PBs, I don\u2019t know, Dirk, if you want to comment a bit on \u2013 specifically on what we\u2019re doing and how we see that progressing in 2020?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. Yes. So, the PB market is starting to recuperate a little bit, but still not that great. And on top of that Tang, our brands, which was the leading brands was having some shared challenges. So what \u2013 and as a result of that, we saw some destocking of PBs in the trade, because there was less demand for it. So, what we\u2019re doing is, we are launching a new bundle on Tang, going a little bit back to what Tang was in the past. We had probably drifted a little bit too much into new variety, new flavor and so on, and more bringing it back to how Tang can really play a role in the daily beverage choice of kids in the family and how it contributes to that. We are increasing our investments. We\u2019re launching a new campaign. We\u2019re launching, of course, a number of new flavors, but overall, it\u2019s a bit too early to say what\u2019s going to happen. We are in the middle of the season of Brazil at the moment, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing on a powdered beverages.","Luca Zaramella","In terms of comparison, the second part of the year will be easier in terms of top-line, because we started the destocking of PBs in the second part. So, I think that\u2019s maybe, the way you have to think about how it will phase out throughout the year.","Dara Mohsenian","Great. Thanks guys.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Dara.","Operator","Our next question is from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Baumgartner","Good afternoon. Thanks for the question.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Luca Zaramella","Hi.","John Baumgartner","Dirk, I wanted to dig a little bit into the local brands. and I guess first off, could you maybe, ballpark what percentage of the revenue base there, it\u2019s already been activated with the increased investments and of the brands that have not been activated, how are you thinking about the phasing of the investment uptick between 2020, maybe 2021 at this point?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. so, the local brands, I would roughly say about 45% of our portfolio is global brands, about 45% is local brands that we want to activate. And then about 10% is a brand that we do not want to activate and largely run there for cash. Of those local brands, those 45%, most of them have been activated; I wouldn\u2019t say yet with the optimal media spend yet. So that\u2019s where we want to increase it. But the ones that we have been able to increase media and reposition them and give them sort of a new purpose that has worked really well for us. So, one of the most striking examples would be Jubilee in Russia, which is a legacy biscuit brand, which was kind of dormant and we\u2019ve revamped it, and it\u2019s now showing double-digit growth and a strong market share increase. And we see that with a number of brands, LU in Europe, and we see that with a number of brands around the world.","So, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s \u2013 within that 45%, that part was not activated than other parts was activated now. But overall, the local brands are growing 3.2% versus the global brands, but the local brands are now getting very close to category growth and we really want them to be in line with category growth and global brands clearly need to be above that, that\u2019s the way we think about it.","John Baumgartner","Okay. And then just to follow up on that, where you had increased the investment in those local brands, I\u2019m curious how your competitors are responding. Are you seeing them generally staying rationale in terms of pricing and kind of following your lead, doubling down on marketing and innovation of their own? Just where are the observations there so far in terms of the competitive dynamics?","Dirk Van de Put","Well, we tried to avoid to run price promotions and so on, on the local brands. So, the reaction there has been, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say, within in a price war as I think about it around the world. Yes. as we move some of these local brands and sometimes we move them more into the sustainability direction and things like that, yes, there is a reaction of competition trying to do the same. But I think overall, that\u2019s very good for the category, because that will help the consumer increase its interest in our category. So, we\u2019re not against it, I think it\u2019s a good movement overall.","John Baumgartner","Great. Thank you for your time.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good evening.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Chris.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. I just had a question if I could ask first, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve addressed it yet. but just, I\u2019m curious what rate of inflation you expect for this year and then related to that, you\u2019ve talked about some pricing, you have some cost savings coming through. Is it pricing that mostly offsets cost inflation for the year or will you need some \u2013 maybe, your simplified growth savings offset some of that as well?","Luca Zaramella","So, I think when you look at the last couple of years, we have seen quite a bit of inflation pressure, mostly around I would say transportation costs, labor costs, and I would add Forex to that, clearly with the dollar strengthening, there was a big inflation component that touched to that. Commodities were a little bit more favorable than the last five years, over the last couple of years I would say, as we move forward, we see a little bit more normal inflation pressure around labor and clearly, there are differences around the world, there are economies like India, where labor inflation is quite high; but overall for the company it is a little bit lower in that area. But clearly, we see a little bit more of a commodity-driven inflation, particularly around cocoa, dairy is another one, and packaging costs as well.","So all in all, we expect commodities, forex and inflation to be in 2020 in the ballpark of what we have seen in 2019. And so we expect obviously to price that away. In the short-term, I think we do as a company a good job in putting in place good coverage strategy. And so we are never hand-to-mouth in terms of some of these commodities or even some packaging inflation can be covered well through those instruments.","And so in the short-term, we will always try to strike the best balance between our volume, our pricing and our inflation. In the long-term or in the medium-term, we really want to price it away. I can\u2019t give you the exact number in terms of pricing. We don\u2019t guide to a breakdown between, what we say in terms of revenue and volume and pricing. But I think it is fair to say I don\u2019t see dynamics changing dramatically into 2020.","What we\u2019re doing in terms of productivity and cost saving initiatives, reality is what we would like to do is for that money to be half reinvested back into the business and fund A&C and route-to-market investments, and there has to be dropped to the bottom line. So that\u2019s the way we think. We see productivity and cost saving initiatives to be the real upside to margin and stepped up investments.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for that. And I have just one other quick question, which would be and I think that \u2013 I think that gets classified under the route-to-market investments, but you\u2019ve had an expansion of distribution in some of the faster growth channels. You\u2019ve talked about the U.S., the club stores and discount stores. I think that\u2019s also occurring in the emerging market. Just curious, is that an incremental investment level for you? Is that costing more than part of your investment in 2020 as well? And should we see that be a contributor to revenue growth?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. We are \u2013 if I would summarize what we did in 2019, which we are largely repeating in 2020, maybe, even increasing a little bit in the developed markets that would be particularly around seasonals that we tried to have a better and stronger in store presence. And then also going into the \u2013 what we call the alternative growth channels in U.S. that would be convenient for instance, and put a bit more manpower, a bit more investment in there \u2013 in the emerging markets, it largely has to see with physical distribution opening more distribution centers, having more trucks on the road, putting more coolers in the stores in India; but also in China for instance, it means going into third tier cities, setting up sales teams there and starting to cover these cities.","So for instance, in China, we\u2019ve added about 140,000 new stores this year and we are planning to continue that into the 2020. So, it does help our revenue clearly, I mean we\u2019ve seen a well above category growth in China and we are seeing very strong double-digit growth in India. And we are counting that our distribution expansion is helping us. and at the same time in the developed markets, we want to continue that shift into more seasonals and more alternative growth channels, which also will help our revenue growth.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good afternoon.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Steve.","Steve Strycula","Good, Dirk. A quick question for you to kick off. As you think about the outlook for 2020 in your guidance for 3% plus growth. How should we think about how you evaluated macro considerations, whether it be \u2013 what\u2019s kind of unfolding in front of us in China right now, or even with some of the other multinational companies has cited with macro softness in select countries across South America. I know that you\u2019ve called out discrete issues for the powdered beverage category, but love to hear your view on those two macro situations and have a quick follow-up for Luca.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. So, if I start with maybe, the developed markets, if we see a little bit of a pullback in developed markets, which we don\u2019t see at the moment, to be honest, we see some very vibrant growth in Europe and in the U.S. So, it\u2019s clearly not visible for us, but I would say, our snacking categories are a little bit more resilient if there would be a pullback in the economy than other FMCG categories. Trade tensions between the U.S. and others are really not currently impacting us. Brexit, I would say is a risk, although I don\u2019t see it in 2020, but if there would be no deal near the end of the year, that would be possibly a disruptor. But we \u2013 I assume at this stage that we\u2019ll find the deal and that it will be a relatively smooth transition.","in the emerging markets and I know that some of our colleagues are seeing different impacts there. We are not feeling an impact in India or in China, but we would probably be a bit more cautious around the projections for Latin America. Obviously, we have high inflationary environment in Argentina, which we are largely managing to protect our scale and our absolute profit generation as well as our cash flow in the country. And we do know and we see it of course, that there is more volatility in emerging markets, but we feel that the growth opportunities far outweigh the risks of that. You have to also take into account that snacking behavior and snacking demand is still growing very fast in these markets and there\u2019s still a lot of runway there. And then I would overall say that our categories are showing an acceleration into 2019.","We are forecasting them at 3%, which is our long-term expectation for our categories. We don\u2019t see that at the moment as being risk, because we believe that there is still a lot of opportunity for consumers to keep on snacking more. And for instance, our study we recently did about the state of snacking clearly showed that the behavior is on the uptick. So overall, I would say we cannot confirm some of the other impressions that you\u2019ve heard from some of our colleagues. We feel pretty good about what we\u2019re seeing around the world.","Steve Strycula","Thanks. Very helpful. And then quick question for Luca. Did I miss in your prepared remarks for fiscal 2020 guidance, what the EBIT dollar outlook would be on a constant currency basis to kind of get to the algorithm you\u2019re on EPS?","Luca Zaramella","Look, we purposely didn\u2019t go there necessarily. We gave you enough elements; I think we have commented a bit on what type of gross profit growth it sees for the year. Obviously, we expect gross profit to be the source of funding for A&C and route-to-market. The long-term algorithm implies a strong mid single-digit OI growth. And again, I think in 2020, if you do the math, we should be around about there. We believe, in the end, the way we are running the business, which is we want to have volume growth. We want to have a shared gain, simplifying a category growth that is projected and exiting the last year, it was 2.8%, so around about three. I think that gives us together with cost savings and investments in the business, the ability for us, by not even counting much on below the OI or the EBIT line items gives us the ability to achieve the high-single digit EPS that is part of the guidance we gave for 2020. And importantly, the $3 billion plus of free cash flow that is our long-term guidance for cash.","Dirk Van de Put","Steve, just before we switch to the next question. Did your question also consider the Coronavirus in China? Was that, because I largely talked about the economies that we see around the world, but maybe it\u2019s also good that I comment a little bit on China and the Coronavirus situation for us.","So, quickly China is about $1 billion net revenue country for us, so about 4.5%. We had a very strong 2019 and it contributed to our growth. We do believe there will be an impact on our Q1 revenue, but it\u2019s really too early to quantify for us at this point. We are monitoring the situation closely and we\u2019ll update you, if in case there is something that we need to report.","The outbreak has come during Chinese New Year, which is a time of high consumption. Our sell-in was in line with expectations, was quite good. We now have to see in the coming weeks what has happened with the sell-out during Chinese New Year. The other thing that is happening is that, normally today our factories, we have four factories in China, two of our factories, they are in a region where we normally would have started up our factories again. The government \u2013 the local government has asked to keep our factories closed for another 10 year \u2013 sorry, it\u2019s 10 days, in order to not have too much of a risk with the infection.","And we also have voluntarily put some travel restrictions to our own people to travel less within China and also for our global people to travel less to China. But overall, I would like to point out that we do believe that this could have a short-term impact, but long-term we continue to be very convinced for the outlook of the Chinese market for us.","Steve Strycula","Great. Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey folks, thanks for squeezing me in, much appreciate it. And happy belated New Year.","Luca Zaramella","Hi.","Jason English","Two things for me, for first, congrats on a row \u2013 on a solid year, it\u2019s great to see the momentum, particularly on your core business, biscuits and chocolate performing quite nicely. The gum and confection side though continues to relinquish on market share side. Can you touch on what, if any plans you have to resuscitate that business? So that\u2019s question one.","And then second question, in the context of overall, the business is doing pretty solid with the portfolio you have. Can you also then touch on your strategic ambitions? As we think about M&A and some of the investments that you have out there, the potential to monetize and the potential to reallocate some of those to build your portfolio in new areas. Just update us on your broader thought process on strategic direction. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay, well. Maybe I\u2019ll talk about gum and candy, and Luca, can talk a little bit about our M&A and strategic investment. So there is a clear distinction this year in 2019 between gum and candy. On gum, what has changed or not changed is the fact that we are doing very well in emerging markets, where we are gaining shares in our gum business. We have year-to-date very good revenue growth, we gained shares particularly in China, which is our second biggest gum market in the world and in Brazil we are gaining share.","It is clearly not the strongest category in those markets, but it is positive growth for the category and positive share for us in emerging markets. We continue to be challenged in developed markets. Largely in the U.S., Europe is in a \u2013 we\u2019re clearly seeing a better situation, but it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s the U.S. that continues to be very difficult for us. The category is displaying now low growth, but it\u2019s growing, but we are still losing some share. And we have some fundamental category challenges and we have some brand challenges.","I would say that, on our major brand Trident, things are quite okay. It\u2019s in the smaller brands, which we are gradually, I would say, flush out of the system, that\u2019s what is causing this continued share loss for us.","As it relates to candy, I would say, the reason why candy was not as vibrant this year was largely due to the U.S. market where we had capacity issue. That capacity issue is now solved and we expect a much better 2020 for our candy business in the U.S. I would say that as we look at the future plans for gum, it\u2019s a difficult situation for us, because gum is very profitable and gives a scale in key markets.","So it\u2019s not something that we can just sort of shift the side. We are working on a number of initiatives to address that share decline. First of all, as I said strengthening our core brands like Stride in China or Trident in the U.S., improving quality, changing the positioning, improving the positioning, we are doing expansion into means that of course doesn\u2019t solve our gum problem, but that does reinforce the brand. And we are having very good results with that, in for instance, France, with Hollywood.","And then we have started to launch a number of new experiences, new reasons to chew, particularly in Brazil and we are also seeing some very good traction on that. So we have the first sort of test and learn as it relates to renew the initiatives on gum and we have to see how they\u2019ll span-out in 2020. So maybe Luca you can talk about the M&A.","Luca Zaramella","Yes. May be let\u2019s start with the coffee and I will start by saying that the JVs are performing well and are very attractive, but at this point in time, in terms of what we have always described as a financial investment and so there would be a point in time where we will exit those investments. They are good investments. They continue to perform quite strongly. We had a good earnings growth related to them in 2019 and we are expecting solid earnings throughout into 2020.","The category itself continue to be attractive. I think in the past we commented a bit into, you know how much we would welcome an IPO of JDE. I think that would establish a public mark for that investment. We believe that eventually will improve our value over all as Mondelez as it is a good asset.","And I think it will allow you guys to do a proper some of the part analysis for Mondelez by a way of \u2013 a subway or for that. I would say also that JDE is truly a great company, still quite a bit of untapped potential, it\u2019s a compelling growth story as a company and it is a little bit more than, than roster ground. I think it is a company that has a big presence in premium segments through what we call instant coffee and on-demand as well as a professional presence in terms of, away from home and servicing other occasions than in Hong Kong. So I\u2019m just \u2013 we feel quite good about those. Having said that, the timing of the exit as we always said will depend upon how much potential we still see in those companies and an appropriate use of funds which potentially is better M&A and assets that we like in the snacking landscape globally.","We will remain disciplined in terms of M&A and we have discussed that our preference at this point in time is on both times. We are looking at premium wellbeing areas, adjacencies and trying to fill some of the portfolio gaps we have both geographically and category wise in some places around the world. So we believe that by staying disciplined, we will have the ability to fill some of these gaps and step up even more \u2013 our growth rate on the top line and on earnings as well.","Jason English","Great. Thank you so much.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","We take our final question from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal.","Ken Zaslow","Good afternoon everyone. I just have two quick questions. One is on the investment, at what point do they become self funding? I know they\u2019ve had good returns, but how do you think about the years in which they will just kind of be a virtuous cycle? And the second question I have is in Europe, what has the utilization rates been in the facilities and where are they now and where they look to be visit. It seems like that\u2019s part of the opportunity that you guys continue to leverage over time as you get more volume through it as operating leverage? And I\u2019ll leave it with those two.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Maybe I\u2019ll talk about the investments and then Luca can talk about the operating leverage.","Luca Zaramella","Yes.","Dirk Van de Put","So when the investments become self funding, I think it\u2019s still a little bit of way for us. We feel that we have potential to drive the categories around the world and we see good reaction, good return on investment still. And so as we are trying to develop a long-term algorithm that is repeatable year-after-year. at this stage, it feels that the algorithm allows us to keep on adding more investments every year and hopefully, that translates into strong facilities. And so I would say at a certain stage, some extra investments will not generate more growth. And then we have to start questioning it, but at this stage you see its working really well for us.","Luca Zaramella","So it is self-funding, I mean for the algorithm to work and for us to be able to deliver upon the promise of share growth, high-single-digit EPS and $3 billion of cash flow. That algorithm itself includes a level of investment, which is factored in, and it is allowing us to hit on all those numbers. I think in the end, the measure of success for us is whether we will be able to deliver share gains consistently. And the second one is, if we increase our volume consistently, all of that came to fruition in 2019.","Dirk Van de Put","Then the second part of the question, there was a little bit of a disturbance in the line. Could you repeat it maybe?","Luca Zaramella","I think I got it. It was about...","Ken Zaslow","Yes. On the European side, it seems like you keep on getting margin expansion utilization. Basically the assets have been put together through acquisitions. As you keep on getting leverage and do some restructuring a little bit. It sounds like the utilization rates should continue to increase. Where have they been? Where are they? And where are they going I guess is kind of what I\u2019m thinking?","Luca Zaramella","Yes. Look, I think in general terms we don\u2019t comment on capacity utilization by result. I think that\u2019s \u2013 that will be a bit of too much of a comment I will say. Look, we have invested quite a bit in terms of both creating a more nimble and a more flexible organization, both in overheads and infrastructure, it\u2019s not only legacy site. We invested in brand new sites in Europe. And Europe I remind you is a little bit more than continental Europe or UK. It is also Russia in our case. So I would characterize the old status of the facilities in Europe quite good. It can be further optimized but we still have available capacity in terms of continuing, growing the big blockbuster brands that we have. Milka is one example, Cadbury, Oreo but also the local brands and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on.","Ken Zaslow","Great. Thank you very much.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Well in conclusion I would say that 2019 was a major step forward for the company and it was the first full year of executing our new strategy. We\u2019ve successfully launched and driven this more consumer centric approach to get growth across organization and as a result, we are building an effective Local First Culture that is delivering. We are a good finish to the year with broad-based revenue growth and strong earnings and cash flow. And the momentum we\u2019ve created across our brands and our geographies this past year reinforces our confidence that we have in our strategy, our people, and our ability to execute.","There\u2019s certainly more work to do, and a long way of opportunities is ahead of us, but we believe that the early success combines with the attractive category dynamics, and further targeted investment provides us greater confidence that we can deliver sustained long-term growth and attractive total returns.","With that I would like to end the call.

We'll close with Q&A.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon everybody. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong top line growth, continuing the momentum of the first-half of the year. As you know, a year ago we launched our new strategy, which intended to accelerate our growth by focusing on the consumer, driving operational excellence, and building a winning growth culture. Today's results are proof that this strategy is working well, and that we're making progress against our goal to create attractive, long-term sustainable growth. So, let's take a look at the quarter in more detail.","We reported revenue growth of 4.2% in the third quarter, which confirms the strength of our snacking fundamentals around the world, as well as the leadership role that our portfolio of global and local brands plays in snacking. The growth was high quality, and driven by a good balance of volume mix and pricing. It was also broad-based geographically. Our emerging markets grew 6.6% or 5% ex-Argentina, and we are encouraged by what we are seeing in markets such as Russia, India, China, as well as Southeast Asia. Our developed markets grew 2.9%. Europe reported strong volume-driven growth in key markets like Germany and the U.K. And in the U.S., we saw continued revenue growth and share gains, which was driven primarily by biscuits.","Our strategy to invest more in our growth initiatives is paying off, resulting in solid operating income growth. Our adjusted EPS growth was 10% for the quarter, and we're also pleased with our year-to-date cash flow of $1.2 billion. As we look across our business units we're seeing evidence that our strategy is creating the basis for sustainable future growth. This is driven by a renewed focus on the consumer, which is informing everything we do, and it inspires and also motivates our teams. So while the entire organization is focused on driving top line growth, we remain true to our culture of cost discipline so that we can ensure that top line growth generates attractive OI dollar growth.","This focus is leading to impactful growth initiatives across our business in key markets and key channels, as well as on our local and global brands. For instance, we're winning in growth channels in both developed and developing markets. In the U.S., this means capitalizing on growth opportunities like discount and club outlets. While in China we achieved new distribution milestones this quarter, we reached 1.5 million outlets with our biscuit products and one million outlets for our gum. And in ecommerce, another example, this means a continued global expansion through our partnerships with e-tailers and online platforms. Our reported growth in ecommerce for the quarter was 25%.","Another area to highlight are our local jewels, local brands that are also contributing to our growth. A few examples that stood out in Q3 are the Jubilee biscuit brand in Russia, the iconic Prince Polo brand in Poland, and for instance, Biskuat in Indonesia. All these are performing well thanks to renewed investment and focus. A big priority for us this year has been to reinvigorate our marketing approach. One manifestation of that focus is what we call our new marketing playbook that gets to the root of what makes our brand special. Our intention is to drive clarity in brand positioning and consistency in execution. We've applied this playbook to many of our global brands, and we'll be rolling it out across more brands in the future.","As a result of this renewed focus, we're seeing some good examples of brand equity campaigns that enhance our connection with consumers. In the U.K., for instance, where our growth was particularly strong this quarter, our latest edition of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Generosity campaign is performing really well. While we are driving growth, we remain very focused on our operational excellence. For instance, in marketing we've seen solid improvements in our return on investment in digital, while in our supply chain we continue to focus on productivity and process improvements. Good examples here would be the digitalization of our procurement function as well as the reduction of waste in our North American network.","Around the world in our different business units, we are trying to reach best-in-class execution. In EMEA, for instance, we are leveraging our significant sales and distribution capability in key markets like India and Southeast Asia to win in seasonals. As an example, our seasonal gifting offerings performed well during the Hindu celebration of Rakhi in India, or as another example this year, Mid-Autumn mooncake season was particularly successful across Southeast Asia with Kinh Do and even Oreo-branded mooncakes selling really well. Local adaptations of our global brands or the success we're having with culturally relevant seasonal offerings underscore the power of our more locally oriented model.","Another strong example of this is the work we are doing in China with our Stride gum brand. Here our approach is to personalize our marketing to Chinese consumers, and it is working well, helping us win with Gen Z consumers through mainly digital spend. Finally, we continue to make good progress with our more agile innovation approach and our SnackFutures initiative. Our focus is on emerging trends and technologies in wellbeing and premium products. As an example, we've recently reached an agreement with a key supplier to explore the use of cocoa fruit by introducing those parts of the fruit into the food chain that have thus far been discarded. A product using this ingredient was developed in record time and put into the market in a very limited distribution to see how it will perform.","This sort of an approach is very different from the innovation approach that we had in the past. I'm also very proud of the progress we are continuing to make on our sustainable and mindful snacking strategies. Creating durable growth also means looking after our planet and the people who contribute and consume our products. This quarter, we were again recognized by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and improved our rating for environmental reporting. This is just one example of how we're brining to life our sustainable snacking strategy, which is our commitment to grow our business the right way.","Another example is how we are using a new methodology focused on science-based targets to help us further reduce our end-to-end CO2 emissions. Finally, I want to mention the work we're doing to respond to the wellbeing needs of our consumers. We are working on offering the consumer the right snacks which can mean different things to different consumers. The options are ranging from smaller portion size formats, what you could call permissible indulgence, to better-for-you products which are made with authentic and simple ingredients or with a particular functional nutritional characteristic. A good proof point was our recent commitment in the U.K. to ensure that all our products that are made for parents to offer to their children are less than 100 calories per serving. I'm quite proud of this move, and know that we will have more to share in the future.","And with that, I will hand it over to Luca.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. As you can see on slide nine, we delivered strong performance across a number of key metrics. Our third quarter growth was notable for both its quality, which was broad-based, as well as for the balance of volume and pricing. During the quarter, we drove growth on a variety of fronts. We delivered strong results in three of four regions. Global brands grew mid single digits, while local brands continued to accelerate with growth in line with overall categories, and this growth was high quality, as it was driven by a balance of volume and pricing. Finally, this happened on the back of strong category growth, which we have driven.","We also delivered solid increase in gross profit and OI dollars along with 10% EPS growth. Productivity and cost savings initiatives provided the fewer for approximately $85 million of business investments through the first three quarters. That was cleansing our brands, our go-to-market positions, and saves and marketing excellence for future years. Finally, Q3 marked another good quarter of free cash flow generation, which continues to be a key priority. We generated $1.2 billion through Q3, and are on target for a full-year outlook of $2.8 billion.","Turning to slide 10, our scale, reach, and expertise in emerging markets are clear assets for our company. We continue to drive robust volume-driven grow in key countries like China, India, Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico, and Africa. In aggregate, emerging markets grew approximately 7%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth greater than 5%. Excluding inflation-driven growth in Argentina, emerging markets grew 5%. Developed markets also performed very well during the quarter with revenue growth of nearly 3% driven by strong volume-driven results out of Europe and North America, where we saw a combination of volume mix and pricing increases.","Now, let's review our profitability performance on slide 11. In the third quarter, we increased gross profit by 2.6%, which in turn translated into solid OI dollar improvement with volume leverage, pricing, and cost savings, partially offsetting investments, primarily in route-to-market capabilities. It is important to note that our profitability results are consistent with our goal of higher quality and sustainable growth. When excluding Brazil, which is dealing with margin headwinds related to supply chain transition and powder beverage category weakness, our business is growing volume mix by more than 2%, growing gross profit dollars faster than revenues, enabling incremental investments across A&C and go-to-market, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue on a year-to-date basis.","Moving to regional performance on slide 12, Europe delivered another excellent quarter with 5% revenue growth. The U.K. was a standout with double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Germany, Russia, and the rest of Eastern Europe also posted strong results. Europe continues to demonstrate sales and marketing excellence with particular strengths in our chocolate franchises, where all of our top brands deliver volume and revenue growth. Consistent with Q2, the Philadelphia business turn in very good results, driven by targeted investments, and great sales and marketing execution. Adjusted OI dollar grew by 6% in Europe due to robust sales and volume leverage, alongside ongoing investments, partially offset by higher A&C.","AMEA grew 5.3%, showing continuous trends across much of the region. India grew double-digits behind strong execution, and an attractive market backdrop. We continue to perform well in chocolate, while building out a more meaningful biscuits business that represents a large opportunity for us. China grew just shy of 10%, driven by another well-executed quarter in both biscuit and gum. The team could show the power of our new local first commercial approach that empowers speed, agility, and consumer-centric decision-making. Southeast Asia grew mid-single digits with solid results in biscuits and chocolate. AMEA increased operating income dollars by 10% due to leverage from top line growth, partially offset by continued increases in investment in high growth potential markets.","Latin America grew 4.3% due primarily to inflation-driven growth in Argentina. Revenue declined 1.5%, excluding Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single digits driven by strong execution in candy, while Brazil posted a decline, mostly due to softness in powder beverages driven by category decline and some share losses. We expect to see some volatility in this category in the coming quarters. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined by approximately 13%, primarily due to volume losses in powder beverages, as well as the plant consolidation issues in Brazil that caused additional waste and logistical costs. We are continuing to work through these issues, and expect to see progress in Q4, though still somewhat wins on an absolute basis.","Finally, North America grew 2.5% in Q3, led by another solid quarter in U.S. biscuits. We grew share in biscuits as Oreo, Ritz, and belVita, all delivered strong results. Improved commercial execution and innovation, share gains in alternative channels, and more consistency in supply chain help dye these results. We remain committed to sustaining our improved performance in the region. The North American region grew OI by almost 5% due to effective pricing and waste reduction with pricing and volume mix providing fuel for marketing investments.","Let me spend a moment on categories highlights. Our three snacking categories continue to demonstrate some fundamentals, with total category growth of 4% on a year-to-date basis. We remain encouraged by the health of our categories, and believe they can continue to sustain growth of approximately 3% over the long-term. In many geographies, we were a key driver of the category growth. This includes areas such as U.S. and China biscuits, India, U.K., Russia, and Germany chocolate, and China gum. As we mentioned before, specifically chocolate is benefiting from a prolonged Easter season and the subsequent halo effect on overall consumption. These tailwinds accounts for almost one percentage points of overall category growth. Overall, we held or gain share in 65% of our business, which is consistent with our second quarter and evident of an improving trend over the past year. This resulted in overall flat shares for Mondelez.","Our biscuits business grew 4.1%. Approximately 75% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including our U.S., China, and India businesses. In chocolate, our business grew 6.4%, approximately 65% of our revenue grew or held share, including the U.K., Australia, and Russia. Gum and candy revenue grew slightly. About 35% of our revenue in this business gained or held share, including strengths in China, France, Brazil, and Russia gum.","Now, turning to EPS on slide 18. Q3 EPS grew 10% in the quarter. This growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results income from the JV equity and the tax benefits in the quarter.","I'll now move on to our free cash flow results on slide 19. We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of $1.2 billion, which is an improvement over the last years through Q3 due to continued progress in our cash conversion cycle, lower cash restructuring, and CapEx. We remain well-positioned to deliver on a full-year target, and feel good about our ability to make improvements over the coming years. I wanted to also mention that we continue to thoughtfully manage our balance sheet, and leverage, and cost of debt. In September, we raised approximately $2.5 billion in new financing at attractive rates to refinance debt matured in late October.","Turning to capital deployment on the next slide, we have returned 2.3 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters.","Moving to our outlook, we are increasing our full-year organic net revenue growth expectations to 3.5% plus. This reflects our strong year-to-date results, which included the benefit of a longer Easter season. These dynamics do not extend into Q4, and as a result, we are not expecting Q4 growth at the same level as the first three quarters of the year.","We are also increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS growth to 5% to 7%. As a reminder, in Q4 we expect to lap significant favorability in the equity income line related to our JDE investment due to the impact in Q4 of 2018 from an enacted tax rate reduction in the Netherlands. Please note that when estimating adjusted EPS we apply 5% to 7% outlook to the prior year basis of $2.42, then adjust for the expected impact of currency, which we anticipate to be circa $0.14. We expect underlying profit performance to be comparable with the profile so far, where volume leverage upsides and gross profit increases will be partially reinvested in growth initiatives. Additional geopolitical disruptions or other disruptive events, including the hard Brexit are not anticipated within this EPS outlook.","We now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion for the full-year on share repurchases as we acquire the perfect snack business, and then managing overall leverage thoughtfully. We repurchased a little over 200 million of shares in Q3 to bring our year-to-date amount to more than 1.1 billion, and continue to repurchase shares at current levels. We remain committed to returning meaningful capital to shareholders and share repurchases continue to be an important component of our capital return program. We will continue to operate with a disciplined approach which aims to optimize results for continuing shareholders and allows for flexibility based on market conditions. Finally, our free cash flow expectations remain unchanged.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Good afternoon.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi, there. Two questions if I could. First, the updated full-year organic sales guidance of 3.5%-plus, as you mentioned, suggests perhaps a sequential deceleration in 4Q. Can you explain some of the puts and takes on that, particularly in light of the accelerated global category growth, I know you mentioned Easter, but wanted to know if there were some other things playing into that as well? And then second, Mondelez did discuss the challenges in Brazil on the supply chain last quarter. Feels like things maybe got a bit more challenging in 3Q. Could you talk about your visibility there, why you think you've got your arms around it, and perhaps you can parse out how much of the impact of third quarter was really supply chain versus some of the other headwinds in Brazil, like powdered beverages and such? Thanks very much.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Well, maybe I'll start with looking at the top line, and then maybe Luca can discuss Brazil. The first thing I would like to say is that the strategy is working well. We are pleased with our progress. We see good momentum in the business; we are delivering on and above our goals. Everything we put in motion a year ago about consumer-centric organization and increasing our speed, execution, and results, it's all working out probably faster than we expected. And in this quarter we saw some quality net revenue growth and also year-to-date as it relates to volume mix and price. The mix between developed markets and emerging markets or between global and local brands as the balance is there.","And the category is strong, as you pointed out, Andrew. In many cases it's driven by us since we play -- we're a major player in the categories. And yes, we do have some challenges in Latin America, but otherwise our overall performance from net revenue through gross profit into OI is a very healthy equation, and it shows that the top line growth we're having combined with the cost discipline is working out for us. We did call up our full-year outlook to 3.5%-plus net revenue growth and an EPS of 5% to 7%. That means that, yes, we expect that Q4 will be a little bit lower. I would say, as you pointed out, Andrew, the first thing to keep in mind is the longer Easter season that we have this year, which will have an effect or lessen -- no affect in Q4, if I can say it like that.","In Q3, we also lapped the heat wave we had last year in Europe which was beneficial to us, so that had a benefit. And so in Q4 we will not see any of these benefits. And overall we feel that our categories are somewhere between 3% to 4% growth, not fully the 4% that we saw in Q4. And we think that the categories will go back to a normal growth rate of around 3%-plus as we've been seeing all the time in reality. As it relates to 2020, we continue to see big opportunities for us to keep on driving the categories to improve our market share and increasing our investment in our brands, in our capabilities, but we have to remain a little bit mindful again about Brexit, which didn't happen this year, but it will have an affect or potential on the first quarter. We'll give you a full outlook on 2020 when we report the Q4 earnings, but I would say, yes, that's the way we're looking at Q4 right now.","So, Luca, may be a bit on Brazil.","Luca Zaramella","Yes, let me maybe just start by saying that Brazil for us is a large and complex market. We have clearly a big portfolio in there that spans pretty much across all the categories that Mondelez competing globally. We have a good set of global and local brands. And as you say, entering Q3 we had a material negative impact that was anticipated for the most part, and this negative impact quite frankly explains the entirety of the profit shortfall that we had in LA in the quarter versus last year. As you said, the issues are two-fold. As we discussed in the last quarter, some plant closures caused transition issues. We ended up line startups that were delayed and we faced extra cost. We ended up scrapping more products than we wanted to. And in addition to that, we had some extra logistics cost. I would say this first issue accounts for pretty much half of the material profit gap we saw in the quarter in LA and in Brazil, as I said.","And the second issue is about powdered beverages, which is a material category for us both in terms of top and bottom line. The category itself is quite challenged at the moment, and our shares of market are declining. The declining trend accelerated a bit in Q3 versus what we saw in the first part of the year. And that resulted in revenue and profit shortfalls, also compounded by the fact that in a declining category and share environment we had to take out some trade stock in the quarter. So we're working on both fronts. And we are making good progress and with our supply chain. But as we said very clearly in Q3, we will still have some impacts in Q4, but the issue should get materially better as we enter 2020.","For PBs, the issue is a little bit more accentuated, and it will take some time for us to address both the category and the share decline dynamics. I would also like to take the opportunity that you provided with your question to reiterate a couple of things. Despite, as I said in my written remarks or recorded remarks, the materiality of the issues in Brazil, and the fact that we are lapping the highest gross margin in Q3 last year, our virtuous cycle is working. GP, NOI are both growing sort of 4% on a year-to-date basis. As I said, when you take out Brazil gross margins, NOI margins are both up on a year-to-date basis. We are delivering the volume leverage and SG&A leverage as we planned.","We continue with cost discipline. I think you see in the quarter a good number for SG&A. That number includes an increase in A&C, but the embedded ZBB behaviors we have are delivering savings. And all of these quite frankly gives me confidence that the model is working, and that we will deliver on our long-term ambition to grow OI and GP more than revenue. So, not ideal what we saw in Brazil in the quarter, but in the big scheme of things when you strip it out I think the model is working and the long-term algorithm we have in mind is safeguarded.","Operator","And your next question is from Chris Growe from Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good evening.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. I just had a first kind of high level question. As you think about the strategy and executing your new strategy and your playbook for the business, I'm just curious how that's developing sequentially, so maybe not quarter-by-quarter, but just like, are you moving on to different types of investments, have you made a lot of the initial investment you wanted to make, is this moving more now to marketing new products? Just trying to get a sense of how that's playing into this stronger revenue growth barring some of the unique things that occurred this quarter?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. Maybe first of all it's a multiyear investment program. We are probably flowing less of our gross profit next year than this year into investments, but we want to keep on increasing our investment year-after-year. And this year, the investment was focused on an increase in our A&C, and increase in route-to-market investments, and to R&D, so innovation. So, Luca was talking about this virtuous cycle, which we want to continue. If I look at what that means for us going forward, I do not expect substantially these investments to change. We do have still areas of the world where we should be putting more and see investment in our brands, particularly the local brands which are accelerating, but they are yet not always on the right level of investment. We still have big route-to-market opportunities, if I think about China, India, where we have to go in third and fourth tier cities. And we for several years we want to be keep on investing, and you can imagine the same for places like Southeast Asia or Africa, where we need to keep on doing that.","And then in R&D, we do want to continue to push on more agility and faster speed, and maybe a little bit less in the years to go forward than we did this year, but it's going to be largely the same three buckets that we are going to invest in. I would also say that apart from increasing our investment, we are also moving more of the investment within A&C into working media. And on top, we are trying to drive the ROI of our marketing spend. We've done things like consolidations of our agency, which drives value and gives us a more consistent quality globally, and we are also working quite hard on our point of sales execution investment, which we will continue next year. So, maybe a long answer to just point out where we are investing and the fact that we see that's continuing, it's working for us, and we feel that there's still a big upside in continuing to do so.","Luca Zaramella","Yes, I -- ","Chris Growe","Go ahead, Luca.","Luca Zaramella","I will comment for a second. All of this is contemplated in the mid single-digit guidance for OI growth that we gave you at Investor Day and the high single-digit EPS growth that again we gave you at Investor Day.","Chris Growe","Going forward. Thank you, guys. Okay. And just one other question, if I could, which is the pricing is coming through this year, would you say that is offsetting cost inflation? So, if we think about pricing net of costs, your -- that's sort of not a factor on the gross margin here, is that the right way to look at that?","Luca Zaramella","Yes, I think it is. I'm particularly pleased about the fact that our top line is in the quarter off volume enough pricing. I think it varies a little bit by region. Clearly, we see pricing more pronounced in emerging markets and in North America, where the inflationary pressure has been a little bit higher than in Europe. Europe growth is mostly driven by volume. I think you see AMEA with combined strong volume growth and pricing. I'm happy to report clearly that North America has returned to volume growth this quarter.","So, overall, we really like the algorithm. It is more volume-driven in developed markets, where margins are higher, and emerging markets, in relative terms, we see a little bit less volume and more pricing which again we like. So, in the big scheme of things, it is quite balanced and it is offsetting the inflationary pressure. We see quite frankly, though, that is also because we covered our commodity and ForEx exposure quite well. So I don't want to hint to any pricing going into next year, but if we have to mark-to-market, our commodities and ForEx impact would be a little bit higher than what you see in the P&L at the moment.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for the color. That was helpful.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Chris.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you.","Chris Growe","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Luca Zaramella","Hi.","Dara Mohsenian","So first, just a clarification, Luca, on the Brazil issue, this just sounds like it'll linger in Q4, are you expecting a similar magnitude in Q4 relative to Q3, and then it's really next year when you start to see that drag dissipate? And then second, in the U.K., obviously very strong momentum in the quarter, double-digit revenue growth, can you give us a bit more detail on what drove that strength in terms of market share versus category growth? And some CPG companies have noticed a bit of slowdown around the Brexit uncertainty even though it didn't ultimately come to fruition this month. So, have you seen any impact there so far in Q4, expecting any deceleration going forward? Thanks.","Luca Zaramella","Yes, maybe I'll comment on Brazil, a little bit on the U.K., and the impacts in here. So, on Brazil, the biggest impact that's been, you know, actual highest in both Q2 and Q3 that will still be an impact in Q4, but the impact will be substantially lower. Importantly, as we enter next year, the supply chain related issues should be fully solved or almost entirely sold. I think we will still see some issues related to powder beverages and competitiveness of Mondelez in that category. Remember in Q1, it is summertime, and so there is a big consumption. So, there might still be some PB, our powder beverage related issues in Q1.","In U.K., I think we are quite frankly heating on all cylinders, the chocolate category is up, it is on the back of a hot summer last year, and the fact that Q3 was quite hot. So, there was a market de-cap, but importantly we're gaining share. Dirk alluded clearly to, or actually said that in Q3 the execution of Cadbury Dairy Milk and the campaign with Cadbury Dairy Milk Generosity is working very well, and we have seen material share gains. So, we are executing quite well around chocolate, but I would also say, around biscuits, which is the other good category. So, we are very pleased with the execution in that market.","Dirk Van de Put","And I would add that at this stage we cannot talk about any slowdown as it relates to Brexit worries, as the numbers testified. So, we don't see -- at the moment we're preparing for it, of course, but we also believe that our categories, the snacking category is not necessarily going to go big swings up and down as consumer sentiment goes up and down. So, we hope that we will be a little bit protected from big consumer sentiment changes.","Dara Mohsenian","Great. Thanks, guys.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan.","Ken Goldman","Hey, good afternoon, everybody.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Ken.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Ken.","Ken Goldman","I wanted to -- I know you're not willing to talk about 2020 specifically yet, but you have bought Brexit a couple of times, and I just wanted to ask how you think about either including or excluding any potential impact from Brexit in your guidance, and some companies have said, \"You know what, there's no way we can quantify it. So, when we think about the out years, we're just not going to even try.\" And other companies who said, \"No, maybe we should bake in a little bit of risk into our guidance just in case.\" I am just trying to get a sense of where you guys are on that spectrum, if you even consider that yet?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, at a larger scale I would say you can say we are really in the first part where we cannot really quantify it, we don't know what type of Brexit it will be. And so, we have not included the larger effect of Brexit into our thinking, but we always include which we will also do for 2020 is the short-term Brexit disturbance that you could have at the borders, where we need to increase our inventories. We need to book more transportation. We need to stock up our raw materials and packaging, and so on. That we have always done, and that we will continue to do, and that's included in our forecast, but if we would be a hard for Brexit with a devaluation of the bounds and a big consumer reaction, that is not included for us.","Ken Goldman","Thank you. And then follow-up is, at Andrew Lazar's conference recently, you talked about Oreo's distribution, not being good enough in U.S. C-stores. I always thought, and I think you guys have always thought, it's a pretty big opportunity that is not necessarily being capitalized on now, but I didn't get a sense of what moves you're making necessarily to improve Oreo in C-stores, whether you're going to use your DSD system to gain distribution and so forth. I just wanted to get a better sense of sort of what the strategy, and maybe some of the tactics are along those lines?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, first of all, I can say that in the background, there's a lot of work going on as it relates to Oreo in C-stores. It takes a while, we have to test our approach, see if it works. So, next year, we're expecting to make bigger strides as it relates to that. Just to clarify, our DSD does not work in the C-store channel. Obviously it's a system that works in the supermarket channel for us. So, we are not planning at this stage to use our DSD system for that, but we do have the right route-to-market setup, and we are building up the right programs and relationships with the clients, and we're expecting that next year we will show some significant progress.","Luca Zaramella","And I think if you look at the market and share for C-stores, I think we are having not as high as the opportunities yet, but we are gaining sharing in C-stores in biscuits as well.","Ken Goldman","Great, thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi, good afternoon.","Luca Zaramella","Hi.","Steve Strycula","So, Luca, a quick cleanup question on the gross margin, excluding Brazil, I think last quarter, you called it out as a $25 million to $30 million profit drag to the line, how should we think about the context specific to Q3? And then I have a revenue question follow-up?","Luca Zaramella","I think it is round about the same number, it is in the ballpark. I think clearly one of the components as I called out it is in relation to PBs, powder beverages, and some de-stocking we had in that category. But when you look at all the numbers excluding Brazil, you really see that the shape of the P&L is good, and as I said, particularly on the year, now we're spending the fact that in Q3 will not be the highest gross margin last year, particularly on a year-to-date basis, you see that virtuous model predicated on volume growth coming into fruition.","Steve Strycula","Great. And then, Dirk, can you walk us through some of the bigger chocolate markets, where Mondelez entered the last few years, but not necessarily has scaled pretty big into specifically China and the U.S.? What's your latest thinking about what the near, medium, and long-term opportunity is for both those markets? Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, so both markets are a little bit the same for us. We entered largely from what I would say as an opportunistic approach, trying to carve out as big a niche as we can. That would lead to a market share somewhere between 1%, 2%, may be 3%, best case. We were always aware of that. I would say now that both markets have very significant players here in the U.S. and in China that we would be up against. So, we didn't want to have sort of a major strategy or a major approach. We wanted to just capture the opportunity that we have, largely using Oreo as a brand. So far we have captured what we were planning to get, but we are not planning on pushing that into other brands or a major chocolate approach. We feel that we have other opportunities around the world, which are more -- which are biggest, and give us a better return, and we want to focus on both first before we want to enter those two big chocolate markets around the world, or increase our presence in those two big chocolate markets in China and U.S.","Steve Strycula","Okay. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good evening, folks.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Jason.","Jason English","Jeez, we've covered a lot of ground so far. So I always wanted to -- I guess I'll bring us back to that gross margin question to build off of Steve's prior question. I appreciate that you are up against a larger year-on-year comp, but just looking back over history, your gross margins aren't made meaningfully different between the second quarter and third quarter. Yet this quarter, they sequentially fell by around 90 bips, but it sounds like a fairly comparable Brazil supply chain issue. I'm not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill here, but can you just help us understand a little bit more what the drivers are of that sequential step-down? And how many of them are durable in nature, and which ones may dissipate with time?","Luca Zaramella","Yes. I'm Luca. If you really look at percentages, I think on a year-to-date basis, we are under about 40%. I think we closed last year at 40.2%. So if we really want to dissect to the decimal points, yes, we are few decimal points behind. I don't think, Jason, there is anything structural besides Brazil. And Brazil again, as I dissect the issue, there is part of it that is going to persist to a certain extent into next year, and it is the powder beverage part of it. On supply chain, we should be fixed. I think as you look at all the components of the gross profit delivery, volume leverage is there. I think when you look at the volume mix that is 2%, that is a good number, I think that provides material leverage both into the GP line and the overhead line, and I think we see it coming into fruition.","In terms of pricing, last year, we announced a couple of ways of pricing in the U.S. market, and I think as you look at the biscuit market specifically, you see volume and value going up. In that context, we are gaining share. I think in emerging markets, we clearly have the pricing discipline that is required. And quite frankly, it is a little bit more sophisticated than going out and announcing big price increases. It is leveraging the full array of pricing tools that we have, including previous optimization, promo intensity, price spec architecture, and as I answered before, if I look at the composition of the commodity and ForEx inflation, and the pricing, we have taken business unit by business unit, I think we did a good job in both emerging and developed markets. And productivity, it is a little bit lower than in the past years, not because gross productivity isn't there, it is there, but we are facing a little bit more inflation on the labor front and the logistics costs.","So, as I dissect the gross margin components, and I take myself in a context where I say, \"Okay, Brazil is a little bit of an outlier. Do I see us having material issues on price net of commodities, productivity, volume leverage?\" The simple answer is \"No.\" I think the one point is mostly attributable to Brazil, it is attributable to the fact that in Q3 last year, the number was higher than the rest of the year, 40% with Brazil embedded into the number, I don't think it is for us something that we should worry structurally about. I think, having said that, we need to continue working well on delivering volume on getting the productivities and pricing in line with inflation we see in the marketplace.","Jason English","Very well, thank you for the fair response. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Your next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good evening.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, David.","Luca Zaramella","Hi.","David Palmer","Hi, Dirk. In the past, you've talked about that country level approach to management and one outcome would be that the local powder brands would be getting more marketing support, could you talk a little bit about that, and how's that going, are your country level managers spending more on those local brands as you had planned, and are you getting a return on that investment in terms of accelerated local brand growth? Any numbers on that would be helpful. And I have a quick follow-up.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. Well, the short answer to your question is, yes, they are spending more on the local brands, and yes, we're getting a return on that, and also, we're seeing an acceleration of the growth. So if I look at our local brands, for instance, in '18 they would have grown around 1%, year-to-date '19, they're growing about 3.5%, and they were even higher in Q3. So we clearly see the effect on our brands and we feel that we're getting a good return. Of course, we want those local brands to grow in line with the markets and they're about there, but there is still we feel the opportunity to keep on investing more. An example would be a brand like Pacific in China, which is very local brand, which is adapted to local flavors, biscuit brands, and it also has a health and wellness connotation. So that plays well, we're revamping LU in Belgium and France. And there's a number of these brands around the world which we think we need to really offer a full portfolio to our consumers. And again, to answer your question, clearly, yes, we have seen very clearly an effect on our local brands and it's working well.","David Palmer","And related to that, I would have thought by now, there'd be more of those bolt-on takes like acquisitions around the world, beginning a wish list, as you get that country level approach, and they're seeing stuff that is more relevant for them in a country level, and then you'd be getting that wish list and would be building up by now and that inorganic growth would be becoming a bigger part of the story. Do you think that that could happen at some point that we start to see more and more bolt-ons as they look to add to the inventory of brands?","Luca Zaramella","Yes, yes. We are constantly evaluating, I would say largely in our bigger markets, what are the opportunities for us to do bolt-on acquisitions. Of course in the first place, we want to invest in our own local brands. But if we see a clear gap in the market and sorting the snacking landscape as we lay it out, and the brands fits their like differences this with recent acquisition of Perfect Snacks here in U.S., protein bar refrigerated largely based on nuts. That is something we don't have growing very fast. So, as we see these opportunities around the world, we are clearly engaging, we try to be disciplined. And so we only will do it when it makes financial sense for us and on top, we see a large runway towards becoming a significant brand. We do not want to buy brands that in the end will not be of significant volume and net revenue to make a difference for us, but yes, again the answer would be yes. And hopefully in the coming quarter, we will see the effect of that.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC.","Nik Modi","Thanks. Good evening, everyone.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi Nik.","Nik Modi","Dirk, maybe hi, how are you? Maybe you could just answer two quick ones. The first is just latest thinking on DSD, just wanted to get your latest state of the Union on that. And then the second is, really talking about the breakfast occasion, as well as savory snacking and kind of how your initiatives in those areas are working and what we should be expecting, if you have any big opportunities over the next few quarters? Thanks.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Maybe on the DSD, as we said in the past, we think DSD for us is a strength. It allows us to have a better customer service and a fuller presence, if I can call it like that in the store. And we've been very pleased with our performance of our DSD in U.S., and we've seen important market share gains and we're pushing the category. Obviously, the way we think about our DSD system is as we acquire some of these bolt-on brands, we're expecting to bring them over time onto our DSD system. And we've been testing that, we want to test very carefully and we do not want to do it overnight, but some of the tests we've been doing putting some of those new brands on our DSD system have been highly successful. And so as we go forward, you will start to see us putting things like campaigns on our DSD across the U.S., which will be a big boost to the test brand.","So we remain very committed to DSD and we have a clear executional expectation of how DSD will perform for our current brands. But we also see a big opportunity to bring some of our new brands onto our DSD system. As it relates to the breakfast occasion, do you mind repeating what you were alluding to Nik because I didn't fully understand it?","Nik Modi","Yes. I'm just trying to get a sense; obviously those are two important opportunities of growth for the company. So just wanted to understand what your - how those businesses performed this quarter and are there any big initiatives that we should be looking at for the next few quarters?","Dirk Van de Put","Well, the brands that we are positioning on the breakfast occasion is belVita. BelVita is a biscuit that gives you a sort of a slow release of energy, gives you a four hour energy. It's a brand that's performing quite well and it's a mid-single digit growth at the moment, doing quite well particularly in the U.S. Our evolution for belVita is to offer it in more different forums going into a soft cake for instance, going potentially into bars and gradually expand the range of belVita to make it a fuller breakfast offering not only in U.S. but around the world and potentially also take the brand into mid-morning snacking, which could also be very interesting, and I think the brand has a credentials not only from a branding perspective, but also from the active ingredients to make that happen. That's really our focus for the breakfast occasion for us.","Nik Modi","Excellent. Thank you. Okay.","Operator","Your next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Robert Moskow","I just wanted to -- this year is characterized as one of reinvestment, so I think people are going to look at the SG&A decline as a percentage of sales as a sign that this quarter didn't get the reinvestment as you normally would give to the business, but then again, you've been very clear that ex-Brazil, there was a reinvestment and the model was working. So can you kind of confirm that this missteps in Brazil didn't result in any kind of lower spending elsewhere around the globe that you knew the profit was coming in weak in Brazil, but that maybe - you cut the spending a bit in Brazil, but not elsewhere. And then secondly, a question on powdered beverage is about $400 million in sales that was just my desk estimate here in Brazil.","Dirk Van de Put","So, to your first part of the question, we didn't comp anywhere. Our PB expenses are up materially in Q3 actually more than only year-to-date basis. So, we protected the A&C investment, as these said many times there are a couple of things to bear in mind there. The first one is we are also skewing more towards working media. So that number that on the face of which is high in terms of total A&C is even higher in terms of working media and in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. And the second element that has to be kept in mind is that management -- certainly management sitting at this table, but also management sitting in the business unit is not getting any past four A&C reductions in terms of incentive. So, if we deliver profit in a quarter through copying A&C, the number is not going count in terms of incentive that we're going to get at the end of the year, and I think that is an important step forward for the past, and the last thing we are going to do is copy and see even in a context where maybe -- we're under a little bit of pressure from a profit delivery.","In Brazil, we did comp some A&C, but it was due to the fact that, we clearly didn't see it working. So, we are not going to be blind and say, yes, let's spend whatever, and no matter what, but I want to reassure that front, we're not going to do anything that we will regret in the medium to long-term. The PB categories in Brazil, it is north of $300 million. As I said, the category is a little bit challenged. We have big brands in there namely, Tang and Clight, and the local brand, which is called Fresh. We are facing a capital pressure point, one it is CSDs are taking share from the category, and the second element -- and so the category is shrinking a bit, and the second element is we are getting pressure from more competitive propositions and low price point propositions for consumers. So we are working on both and there is a more comprehensive plan we have in place for our beverages which hopefully will bring some positives, but I think it will take a little bit of time for that plan to really be in full effect and bring the capital back up and our share back up.","Robert Moskow","Great, Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you. I think we can stop the questions here. We are at the top of the hour. So, to wrap it up, our third quarter results, particularly our top line performance demonstrates the continued strength of our core categories and the power of our unique local and global brand portfolio. Our new strategy focused on growth, execution and culture is continuing to drive engagement and results across our business units.","We are encouraged by our early progress against our strategy. We're equally excited about the opportunities that we see ahead of us, particularly for next year, and to increase further the momentum for our company. We see that in the form of expansion into adjacencies, driving market share gains in our existing portfolio, or reinforcing the growth potential of our categories. Our focus going forward remains on continuing to execute against our strategy, and ensuring that the company is well-positioned for sustainable growth and attractive long-term shareholder value creation.","Thank you for dialing in. Thank you for your interest in the company, and talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President of Investor Relations for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir.","","Dexter Congbalay","Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Dave Brearton, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release. This release and today\u2019s slides are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com.","As you know, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today\u2019s prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Irene.","","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks Dexter. As you know, 2013 was our first full year as a global snacking company. Frankly, we are very disappointed that our performance was below what we and our shareholders originally expected. But it turns out to be quite a challenging year as we faced slower category growth and volatility in some of our key markets. In the context of this macroeconomic environment, we delivered solid results.","For the full year, revenue increased 3.9% in line with the overall growth of our categories. Our revenue was high-quality driven by strong volume mix. This type of volume mix was the best in our industry. Our share performance was also strong with about 70% of our revenues gaining or holding share. In emerging markets, we grew 9% despite the fact that they were disproportionately affected by the category slowdown. As entered 2014, four of our five regions have strong underlying momentum with Asia-Pacific being the lone outlier. As you know, we have already taken a number of steps to regain momentum in Asia, including strengthening our management teams at the regional level and in China, India, and Australia. We have also improved our monitoring systems of leading indicators like trade stocks and short up our analytical capabilities. These changes will help us detect potential issues much earlier and make us a stronger operating company. Turning to profitability we delivered adjusted OI margin of 12% in line with our guidance. Our margin improved sequentially each quarter last year exiting with Q4 margins at nearly 14%. Finally our adjusted EPS was a $1.51 that\u2019s up 13.5% on a constant currency basis consistent with a double digit guidance we gave throughout the year.","Our favorable tax rate allowed us to accelerate our growth investments in emerging markets while still delivering strong double digit growth on the bottom line. Before I turn the call over to Dave let me give a few more details on our revenue and share performance. Vol mix was the primary driver of our growth with all of our regions posting gains. Overall vol mix contributed 3.4 percentage points to our top line. Pricing was only a modest contributor mainly due to the impact from coffee as we passed through lower green coffees to our customers. In the final analysis coffee tampered organic revenue growth by 80 basis points for the year and 70 basis points in the quarter.","As I mentioned earlier our emerging markets performed well up nearly 9%. Our BRIC markets grew about 10%, Brazil, Russia and India each posted double digit growth while China was up low single-digits reflecting a significant slowdown in their biscuit category. Our developed markets increased 8\/10ths of a percent with North America and Europe both posting solid growth. Our power brands which represent about 60% of our total revenue grew 6.5%. They continue to fuel both our growth and our margins as we distort our spending to these brands. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Lacta, Oreo, belVita, TUC, Club Social and Barni all posted double digit gains. From a category perspective in aggregate we grew in line with our categories. We used our strong share performance to offset volatility and market such as China, Egypt, and South East Asia.","The roll out of proven innovation platforms into new markets continues to be a key driver of our category growth. Biscuits and chocolate had a terrific year and despite continuing challenges in gum our snacks revenue was up nearly 5%. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each category, biscuits continued to perform well. Revenue was up 7% clearly outpacing category growth of 5.5% and we grew or hold share in 70% of our revenue. Oreo led the way up double digits with annual revenue now approaching $2.5 billion. belVita which anchors our sustaining energy platform continued to grow rapidly up 25%. belVita now generates revenue of over $0.5 billion more than doubling in size since 2010.","Chocolate revenue growth was also strong up nearly 6% and share performance was outstanding with 80% of revenues gaining or holding share. Cadbury Dairy Milk had a stellar year growing low double digits overall including more than 20% in India. Mocha was up nearly 10% driven by strong growth in emerging markets. Gum remains the only soft spot in our snacks portfolio, gum and candy revenue declined 1.5% as the mid-single digit decreased in gum more than offset below single digit increase in candy. Despite continuing weakness we\u2019re seeing improvement in gum as we implement a number of initiatives to rejuvenate the category. Over half of our revenues gained or held share last year and in the fourth quarter although gum revenue in developed markets was down mid-single digits that\u2019s encouraging progress from the mid-teens decline we saw earlier in the year.","Outside of snacks beverages revenue increased about 1%. Coffee decreased low single-digits. That was in line with the category and a clear reflection of the pricing environment driven by lower green costs. The pass-through was especially pronounced in roast and ground coffee, which makes up roughly 40% of our business.","From a share standpoint, two-thirds of our revenue gained or held share led by on-demand and soluble coffee. Tassimo, in particular, continued to show strong growth with revenue increasing 30% to over $450 million. That\u2019s on top of a gain of more than 20% in 2012. Powdered beverages primarily our $1 billion Tang brand had another robust year with high single-digit growth and strong market shares.","Finally, the remainder of our portfolio, cheese and grocery grew 1.3%. So for the full year, we delivered high-quality revenue growth in line with recent category trends. Strong share performance and sequentially improving margins consistent with our guidance. Looking ahead, we are committed to improving results in 2014 and beyond. We remained focused on increasing efficiency and aggressively reducing costs both in our supply chain and in overheads. Although near-term economic conditions will remain challenging, the plans we are executing give us great confidence in our potential to significantly expand margins and deliver strong top line growth.","With that, let me now hand it over to Dave.","","Dave Brearton","Thanks Irene. 2013 was indeed a challenging year and no more so than our Asia-Pacific region. Organic revenue was up only slightly for the year 0.6%. Emerging markets were up mid-single-digits offsetting a mid-single-digit decline in developed markets. Revenues were notably weak in the second half of the year, including a 6% decrease in the fourth quarter. This was primarily due to the issues in China biscuits that we discussed in our third quarter earnings call. As expected, despite strong growth in gum, China was down double-digits in Q4 as our distributors reduced excess biscuits inventory. While the impact of destocking is now behind us, we expect biscuits growth in China will continue to be soft for the first half of the year consistent with recent category trends and this rely for strong year ago revenue comparison.","In the fourth quarter, Asia-Pacific\u2019s revenue growth was also tempered by aggressive promotional spending in our developed markets, especially in Australia and New Zealand. This was the key factor driving our pricing down 4.4 percentage points in the quarter. On the positive side, India continued to perform well, up low teens for the year driven by strong chocolate growth. Our share performance across the region was also strong with over 60% of our revenues either gaining or holding share. And Power Brands significantly outperformed the rest of the portfolio, up 6.5%.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the other regions. As Irene mentioned earlier, all of our four other regions exited the year with good underlying momentum and solid results. In EEMEA, organic revenue grew 9.2% driven by double-digit gains and volume mix. Pricing was a bit lower down 1.8 percentage points. This mostly reflects lower prices in coffee, particularly in Eastern Europe as well as chocolate in Russia. Importantly, we delivered growth across the region and in almost all our categories even with the pricing pressures in coffee and chocolate. Russia was up double-digits led by strong volume mix across much of its portfolio. These gains were due in part to the incremental A&C and route-to-market investments that we made earlier in the year while the standout performers included the Gulf States, West Africa and Egypt. Market share across the region was very strong with over three quarters of revenue gaining or holding. And Power Brands were up 14%. The Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Barni, Jacobs and Tang, all posted strong double-digit gains.","Turning to Latin America, organic revenue grew 12.3% for the year, almost entirely due to pricing in the hyperinflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Each of these businesses has revenues of about $800 million. After our $2 billion Brazilian business, this makes them our second and third largest markets in Latin America. Our teams in Venezuela and Argentina has done a good job responding to the challenging economic conditions all year. However given these markets volatility we continue to have a cautious outlook. In Brazil despite softening category trends as the year progressed revenue was up double digits with balanced contributions from both raw mix and pricing. Biscuits, chocolate and candy each grew double digits. Slow growth covered beverages was up high single-digits. Like Russia the incremental investments we have made in A&C and route to market expansion began to pay off especially in the fast growing north-north east region of the country. Market share performance of Latin America was mixed it's a little less than half of our revenues gaining or holding share. Overall shares of our power brands faired well especially in Brazil.","However in markets like Argentina and Venezuela the effects of high inflation have led some consumers to trade down to cheaper brands. Finally power brands were up 13% with Lacta, Oreo, Club Social, Halls and belVita all delivering double digit growth.","In Europe organic revenue was up 8\/10ths of 1%, vol mix contributed over 3 points of growth on the year while pricing declines nearly 2.5 points mostly due to coffee. For the full year as well as in Q4, lower coffee revenue affected the region\u2019s growth by about 2 percentage points.","Looking at performance by category, chocolate revenue was up mid-single digits driven almost entirely by vol mix; growth across the region was broad-based with double digit growth in Central Europe. Milka and Cadbury Dairy Milk each delivered strong growth while innovation platforms such as Marvellous Creations and Bubbles [ph] made strong contribution. Biscuits were also up mid-single digits with most of the gains coming from vol mix. Oreo, belVita, and our Choco-Bakery platforms owe much of the growth. belVita [ph] clients in single digits due to lower pricing more than offsetting solid vol mix. Our convenience coffee platforms notable Tassimo and Millicano continue to perform strongly.","Gum and candy revenues were down in single digits entirely due to gum. However gum revenue in the fourth quarter was only down to mid-single digits a significant improvement from earlier in the year. Candy was up modestly driven by strength in Cadbury Eclairs and Mocha coffees. Europe\u2019s market share performance remained strong at about 2\/3rds of revenue gained or held share and our power brands grew 4% with double digit gains in Oreo, Cadbury Dairy Milk, and Tassimo and Choco-Bakery.","Finally in North America organic revenue increased 2.9%, this gets delivered another outstanding year. Revenue was up more than 5% largely through vol mix. Both Oreo and Chips Ahoy! grew double digits driven by strong flavor and packaging innovations highly successful marketing campaigns and increased in-store displays. belVita also had an excellent year, nearly doubling revenues and crossing the $100 million and we had a strong year behind double digits gains of Sour Patch Kids and Swedish Fish, but Halls grew mid-single digits.","In gum revenue declining in-line with the category down mid-single digits in the fourth quarter that\u2019s an improvement from the first nine months of the year as we begun differ from the impact of the shelf reset.","Overall market share performance was outstanding with over 85% of the regions revenue gaining or holding share.","Turning to profits adjusted gross margin was essentially flat for the year, (indiscernible) significant improvement in our cost structure. Supported by the supply chain initiatives we described last September we generated gross productivity of well over 4% and record net productivity of 2.5%.","These savings however were offset by commodity inflation especially in emerging markets such as India and Brazil. As local currencies weakened the cost to purchasing raw materials traded in dollars, euros or sterling spiked. And while we usually have good commodity coverage it's significantly more difficult to cover these Forex impacts so it keep our cost of goods quickly.","Of course we fully expect to offset commodity inflation overtime including the impacts of currency but we\u2019re unable to price quickly enough to protect gross margins in the back half of the year. Once these prices increases are fully implemented the methods for net productivity will flow through to improved gross margins. Adjusted OI margin was 12% on the year and 13.9% in the quarter consistent with our guidance. The full year result was essentially flat compared to the prior year, including a 10 basis point impact from the devaluation of the bolivar and a 30 basis point impact related to our decision to accelerate some investments in emerging markets. We offset much of these impacts through overhead leverage in developed markets. In Europe, margins rose 60 basis points to 13.6%. And in North America, margins increased 110 basis points to 14.9%. Clearly, we are already making progress towards our long-term margin goals for these regions.","Moving on to earnings per share, adjusted EPS for the year was $1.51. Currency was a negative $0.09 headwind, including $0.03 from the write-down of the net monetary assets related to the devaluation of the bolivar. On a constant currency basis, adjusted EPS grew 13.5%. Operations were favorable $0.04 from the year despite the investments we made in emerging markets. Much of the remaining increase on adjusted EPS was in the tax favorability related to discrete items. However, as we progressed through the year end closing process, we determined that some of these items should have been recorded in prior years. As we described in our earnings release, we have increased our 2013 taxes to reflect this revision resulting in a $0.02 reduction in adjusted EPS.","We have also made corresponding reductions to taxes for the years 2009 to 2012 and adjusted retained earnings for any items prior to 2009. All of these items are non-cash. Even with this revision as well as an unusually tax rate, high tax rate in Q4 due to a recent change in French law, our 2013 adjusted effective tax rate of around 15% was low due to many of the discrete items we discussed during the year. In 2014, we continue to expect our tax rate to be about 20% in line with our mid-term guidance.","Turning to cash, free cash flow was $2.3 billion after excluding the impact of the Starbucks arbitration. This is well above the midpoint of our previous guidance of $3 billion for 2013 and 2014 combined. The improvement in working capital was the key driver of the favorability. We took our cash conversion cycle by 14 days or nearly 50% to finish 2013 at 15 days. Cash flow was also aided by delays in capital and restructuring projects, which we expect to catch up in 2014. As a result, we are updating our expectations for the combined total free cash flow for 2013 and 2014 to at least $3.7 billion. This increase from the original target reflects the phasing of CapEx spending and stronger working capital performance.","Turning to our 2014 outlook, our goal is to grow our top line at or above the growth of our categories. In 2014, we anticipate organic net revenue growth will be approximately 4%. We expect adjusted OI to grow low double-digits on a constant currency basis. The combination of top and bottom line growth both adjusting and adjusted OI margin in the high 12% range. In terms of pacing, we expect year-over-year margin improvement each quarter. We continue to evaluate opportunities in both overheads and supply chain to accelerate margin expansion and we\u2019ll update you of those opportunities per month.","Finally, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $1.73 to $1.78. As we did last year, we are providing this guidance on a constant currency basis. Based on spot rates as of January 31, currency would be $0.07 headwind to our current range. You can see the details of the spot rates used in the appendix of this presentation. We will continue to give updates on currencies each quarter based on the latest spot rates.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at organic revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Moving forward, we will frame our organic growth opportunity in relation to overall category performance. As we outlined in the third quarter and again today, our categories have slowed across the board. In 2013, our categories grew in aggregate about 3.8%, with fourth quarter growth at about 3.2%. And while that fourth quarter deceleration is not indicative of our 2014 expectations, it does show continuing volatility in the marketplace. Based on current trends, we expect the category growth rates to be about 4% in 2014. We will use market share gains to offset potential volatility and provide upside.","Before we move on to the EPS, I would like to highlight a couple of pacing considerations on our revenue growth this year. We expect the first quarter to grow between 2% and 3% due to a number of factors. Easter is coming three weeks later in 2014 as a result some holiday related shipments will ship from the first quarter last year to the second quarter this year. We expect coffee prices will be a headwind in Q1 and likely for the first half as we compare to 2013 periods when prices were still coming down. Obviously the recent spike in coffee prices is sustained could change our full year outlook but it won't affect Q1. In china we expect the biscuits category will reflect the same weakness at they have been in 2013.","While the impact of these factors behind us in the near term China biscuits will not be a significant source of growth. Lastly we\u2019re increasing prices across most geographies this quarter in-line with our strategy to deploy recover commodity in Forex impacts. In the near term we may face temporary disruptions with customers and consumers as the market adapts to the new prices. We expect this impact will be most pronounced in Q1.","Turning to EPS we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of a $1.73 to a $1.78 up double digits on a constant currency basis. Consistent with our expectation of double digit operating income growth the majority of EPS growth will be delivered by operations. Taxes will be a significant headwind this year but will be more than offset by lower interest expense and shares outstanding. The figures on this chart are directional reflecting what we know today but they will provide a frame of reference for you to understand the expected EPS drivers.","So to wrap up 2013 was a challenging year but we delivered solid results. More importantly our emerging market investments and our early progress on cost reductions in both overheads and productivity set a stage for a strong 2014 especially as it relates to margin improvement. Of course 2014 will have some of the same category challenges we faced last year but we expect the top line to grow in line with our categories as when you share gains to offset market volatility. Furthermore strong growth in our operating income and margin will deliver double digit EPS growth which will put us at the top of our peer growth.","With that I would like to open it up for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Just two quick things from me I guess first of the 300 basis points in margin that you\u2019re targeting through 2017 I think about 250 basis points was highlighted initially as coming from the gross margin side. I guess you\u2019re now talking you know again more aggressively about potential overhead opportunity. I think you\u2019ve even brought somebody board fairly recently to help look into this a bit more deeply and I guess what would you peg the overhead portion of margin through 2017 now if that\u2019s change and does this increase the overall margin target and\/or maybe just accelerated or just shift the composition of how you get there?","","Dave Brearton","I think the way to think about overhead Andrew is it has been the single biggest driver of our market increase over the last few years. It was again the biggest driver of the margin increase in North America and Europe last year and we still believe we have some road ahead of us on that. You\u2019re correct we brought James Kehoe back in at the end of last year as our top management person and a key part of his role is in fact overhead management and he is in the process now working with us to implement a zero based maturity [ph] approach going forward. So I would yes overheads will be an opportunity in 2014 and beyond. I think it's too early for us to quantify that but we will probably give you some more insight on how we\u2019re thinking about overheads impact.","","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Right and then Irene as you have spoken about I think in your prepared remarks and even in the last quarter your category growth rates have slowed since the time of the split and certainly had the largest impact on your recent top line trends. I guess do you think it makes sense to move more towards sort of a long term top line target that is more market growth based? In other words you know market growth plus on factor for share gains you know Procter for example, Procter does the\u2026","","Irene Rosenfeld","I think we\u2019re taking the first step in that direction with the guidance that we have given you for 2014 but without a doubt as we monitor these markets and we see how our categories are evolving it will be our intent to grow as we have said at or above those category growth rates and I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it.","","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","And just as part of that I mean in \u201914 obviously you will grow in-line with the market because you got share gains offset by some volatility. I guess, over time, I would think you would expect to grow ultimately at market growth rates plus some factor, so, i.e., faster than your category growth rates over time. Is that the right way to look at it and it\u2019s just now the market volatility that\u2019s bringing it back down to in line with category growth?","","Dave Brearton","I think it\u2019s a question of just how we frame up the expectations. We have given guidance to be at or above category growth rates. And I think that\u2019s the approximately 4%. Last year, we actually grew share in most of our markets and we were slightly above the category growth rates. And I think we strongly believe that the brands we have got are capable of growing faster than the category. I think as we think about it, we would rather keep that share upside for either covering any emerging market volatility like Venezuela or ideally to deliver upside to the guidance we are giving. And so that\u2019s how we are thinking about it, but clearly, internally we are driving per share growth.","","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Thanks very much and see you all next week.","","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel.","","Chris Growe - Stifel","Good evening. Can you hear me okay?","","Dave Brearton","Yes.","","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay, thank you. I want to ask as you look at your growth profile for \u201814 and the 4% revenue growth, you had a pretty sluggish environment in the developed markets some of that\u2019s coffee I realized, I am just trying to get a sense of emerging markets versus developed market growth in \u201814, if you can give anymore color on that?","","Dave Brearton","Yes, I think we haven\u2019t given any specific guidance for \u201814 by segment, but I think it\u2019s fair to say that the categories last year in emerging markets grew in the sort of 8% to 9% range and our revenue growth in emerging markets last year was about 9%. So to the extent that we are saying we don\u2019t see the category to get through is changing a lot, those are probably reasonable guidelines for next year. We still find emerging markets over time will return to double-digit growth, but that\u2019s probably not in the next 12 months. Developed markets growth has to say, I mean, the categories have slowed a lot in emerging markets, but a big diver of that, particularly in Europe was in the coffee business. Again, we are not counting on a big recovery and that\u2019s in the short-term, whether North American growth rates tend to be in the 2% to 3% range. In Europe, it\u2019s a bit lower, because of coffee.","","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. Just I had a quick follow-up if I could on your pricing versus cost inflation if you gave it I didn\u2019t hear, but is there any range you are talking specifics but about the percentage increase in cost inflation or how much pricing you should expect across the year as a contributor to revenue growth?","","Dave Brearton","We haven\u2019t given a specific number here, but I think it\u2019s actually not too much commodities, it\u2019s more currency, which frankly makes it a little harder to tend down, because it\u2019s more volatile and we have less coverage on it. But it is \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a fairly significant driver of the revenue growth in the first half of the year, in particular and it will be more skewed to emerging markets. There is some significant pricing in Europe, but it\u2019s going to be more skewed to emerging markets.","","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay, thanks for the time.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer from RBC Capital Markets.","","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Chris (indiscernible) for Dave. Just a quick question, just a follow-up on coffee, you mentioned it\u2019s still a headwind in the first half, but can you provide any visibility on whether it will be a drag in the second half your view on the second half?","","Dave Brearton","Yes, I think the reason we said it\u2019s a headwind in the first quarter, specifically is last year at this time, coffee prices were still coming down, it\u2019s about $1.45 last year at this time. And the pricing in the marketplace today is more in 110 to 120 range because that\u2019s where green coffee has been for most of the last six months. If you ask me about the back half of the year, then I have to start projecting what green coffee costs are going to do. As you might have noticed, coffee costs spiked up about two weeks ago. We are up about 140 today. If it stays there, we would obviously adjust our prices upwards to reflect that, because coffee is an extra category that\u2019s not built into our guidance, but I think it\u2019s way too early to say whether that\u2019s going to sick or not, regardless it wouldn\u2019t affect quarter one. Quarter one will play out more or less based on where the pricing in the marketplace is today against that kind of 145 base last year.","","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Hey, good afternoon everyone.","","Dave Brearton","Hi Bryan.","","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Just a question on I guess marketing investment in emerging markets, I think you had previously talked a bit about $100 million incremental investment in \u201813 and then I think an extra $100 million in 2014. So I guess first can you just \u2013 are those still good numbers for us to be working with? And then second kind of given the change in the environment, is there anything different you are doing with those dollars versus your original plan. I guess as the environment has sort of changed that you know perspective on marketing investments in emerging markets.","","Dave Brearton","In terms of the numbers we had a plan to increase emerging market investments overtime. This year we made decision to accelerate about a $100 million for that investment from \u201914 than the","\u201913 and I have (indiscernible) that\u2019s part of our results this year so we did make that step up. We\u2019re not pulling back on that but we will sustain that kind of spending as we go into next year so we\u2019re not going to have another step change but we will try to sustain that level of spending as we did in the next year but in terms of how we think about the investments although Irene will address that.","","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes we continued to see the opportunity to make foundational investments that we think will get a good return investments in route to market, investments in sales capabilities for example so that we\u2019re well positioned as these markets recover and we certainly did see a good return on our investments in markets like Russia and India and Brazil last year. So we will continue to look at those investments. We\u2019re going to pull that a little bit on some of the AMC investments as we see the categories continue A&C investments as we see the categories continue to grow at the rates that are out there today because we\u2019re just not finding that we\u2019re able to change the trajectory much with those investments. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it but we will obviously continue to monitor the markets and make the adjustments accordingly.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay couple of questions, first on well I guess you call it marketing, admin and research so the it looks like you\u2019ve been running in that line roughly 2.1 billion to 2.2 billion a quarter is that like a decent run-rate because the comparison for whatever reason I\u2019m not sure it would hurt you or it was so costly a year ago like so much margin expansion came from that line. You know your gross margins were actually down in the quarter so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to what is the right level there and if you could also kind of say what advertising and promotion were you know up or where it was for the year in the quarter that will be helpful.","","Dave Brearton","Sure. I mean that line we would have called selling, general and administrative expenses includes all of what we call our advertising and consumer promotions. It includes all of our overheads outside the manufacturing area. It also includes other income expense which has some of the sort of one-off items that would come from asset sales and stuff. So it is a broad bucket. I think the reduction year-over-year is partially Forex frankly but also partially overheads are down and particularly down in North America and in Europe where we have had pretty good programs all through the year and we have been building, saving as we went through the year.","Quarter Four a year ago was also relatively high particularly in North America because that was the first quarter after the spin and that\u2019s really when the dissynergies hit sort of the before whack in the fourth quarter last year. So that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s in that bucket and what\u2019s driving the reduction. In terms of the A&C spending we said that we spent just over 9% in 2012, what we finished last year about the same actually. We invested more in emerging markets but we have some good productivity programs in the developed market that allows us to get some efficiencies out of that. So again the same kind of reach.","","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay and what are your plans for 2014 on that number?","","Dave Brearton","We haven't given any guidance on that but I wouldn\u2019t expect any material changes up or down. We will talk probably a little more about that soon.","","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay and then in terms of your I guess so just so I understand it more clearly your reported revenue you\u2019re like right now you\u2019ve got up organic I guess 2 to 3 that you\u2019ve got you ended the fourth quarter on line a negative 2.5 on currency but you\u2019re saying that you\u2019re implementing pricing so your hopeful that the pricing offsets the currency on top line so in dollar terms you hope for the year to still for your organic to basically include your reported?","","Dave Brearton","When we talk about pricing to cover commodities and currency we\u2019re talking about transaction. So the impact of currency on the cost of importing materials into a specific country. We don\u2019t try to price to recover in the translation impact of currencies so that\u2019s part of when we talk about we gave guidance on a constant currency basis, the approximately 4% just on a constant currency basis. If currencies stay where they are today, then it would come up a bit because of that. As we said, the EPS impact of the spot today is about $0.07, so you would expect that to come down a bit on reported basis, but I would expect those currencies to move around a bit as we go through the year.","","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. And then I guess last question to Irene, Europe you talked about some margin improvement out of that market, it sounds like in some places, France, in particular is very important to you, but France is in some ways become more challenging in terms of their regulatory government approach to business. So some of the improvement that you are hoping for in that region, is that still feasible or is that kind of maybe being pushed out until the environment becomes a little more friendly for you to do so?","","Irene Rosenfeld","No. OpEx has always been a challenging environment in which to do business. And we adjust our timing typically accordingly as a result of that, but I am very pleased with the performance of our European team this past year and that they improved their margins about 60 bps and it was primarily driven by lower SG&A across the board. So that\u2019s the challenges in any individual country doesn\u2019t affect our overall confidence and the ability to continue to drive margins in that region.","","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay, thank you. See you next week.","","Irene Rosenfeld","Okay.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll from Citi Research.","","David Driscoll - Citi Research","Yes. Can you hear me?","","Dave Brearton","Yes.","","David Driscoll - Citi Research","Super. First one, just a little one and then a bigger picture question, can you quantify the Easter effect in 1Q, is that about \u2013 is that worth about a point?","","Dave Brearton","Yes, I would rather not quantify it, because truthfully, I think last time we had an Easter shift that shifted literally the entire Easter shipments this year three weeks, so maybe partial. So I think it\u2019s going to depend frankly as we negotiate with each customer. So we have given you an aggregate of 2% to 3% and a number of factors below that, but I\u2019d rather back in them specific from Easter.","","David Driscoll - Citi Research","Okay. On gross margins, is it fair to say that the gross profit margin was strong or stronger in North America and Europe and hit pretty hard in the emerging market regions, would that explain the weak fourth quarter gross margin?","","Dave Brearton","Yes, directionally that would be right. The biggest hits we got on the gross margin line were from currency, which as I said we don\u2019t have coverage on currency in a lot of the emerging markets, whereas we can cover that pretty easily for Europe and North America. And so that demonstrates quickly, we are putting the pricing in place across the globe today, but in the back half of the year, there was a lag as we have the hit on the currency and we didn\u2019t get pricing to resume Q1. So yes, the gross margin was more in the emerging markets less in the developed markets.","","David Driscoll - Citi Research","Any way to quantify that number?","","Dave Brearton","I think as you look at the some of the OI bridges, you can see by reason where the margin declines were, but gross margin was a decent component of that.","","David Driscoll - Citi Research","Alright. Related to this then, so you are taking pricing in these emerging markets that it\u2019s kind of FX based pricing, not really the underlying commodities, how is it being received, what\u2019s the volume sensitivity here and frankly is this kind of the key risk to choose one and two in \u201814?","","Dave Brearton","Yes, I think it\u2019s correct, it is resolving the underlying costs trends. The issue on the currency is not the translation, which I would agree would be more (indiscernible) to U.S. companies, but if India buys cocoa, they are buying at British pounds and so the Indian rupee at the values they have got to pay more and pay us to get their cocoa. So if the local cost increase, all the competitors face the same thing. So we are not going to be able to step with the industry. The reaction we talked about and the sensitivity in emerging markets is likely to be more from consumers and it just takes a while to get the price back on a potential way to make sure that in every channel, there is a right path and the right size and right price point for every consumer and get that all the way through the system, it pays consumers a little bit, get used to that. And typically it\u2019s a quarter in emerging markets. So that\u2019s really what we talked about in the first quarter has been one of the headwinds, but I would say that \u2013 I would consider that normal when you take these kind of price increases.","","David Driscoll - Citi Research","If I could sneak one final question in, Irene, just can you comment on the coffee operations, frankly it\u2019s always sought that this was a scale provider in Europe and perhaps even in Russia, would you agree with that and is there any desire or sensitivity on your part that this would be an operation that you would consider selling?","","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, I am not going to comment on any hypothetical stuff David. I think the reality is that it does provide an important scale role as you say in Europe and Eastern Europe and it has been historically it's gone contributor to our profitability in our cash flow. This cash year has been quite the anomaly given the tremendous volatility that we have seen in pricing and as we have mentioned it's been a disproportionate as having a disproportionate impact on the top line. We have been able to protect margin. So net-net it is a volatile category it has performed reasonably well and well in line with our portfolio over the last couple of years, but 2013 was a rather unique year.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Goldman Sachs.","","Unidentified Analyst","So first real quick housekeeping question, I apologize if I missed this already. The SG&A drop in the quarter was much bigger than we expected. Can you help us decompose how much of that was advertising related versus we had sort of overhead efficiency.","","Dave Brearton","I don\u2019t want to get into breaking that every time I would say in the quarter the biggest contributor to the margin gains we found North America and Europe were overheads and I think a lot of the other stuff that\u2019s in that line there is other income expense which has an asset sales. Last year we had some as well but they were in a different quarter and this year it's headed fourth quarter.","So there is a lot of numbers in there I think the takeaway you should have is we\u2019re continuing to sort of support our business on the A&C side and the real underlying margin growth in North America and Europe is driven by overhead cost management particularly as we run through the back half of the year.","","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. But don\u2019t necessarily take this 23% of sales to the bank on a go forward?","","Dave Brearton","I don\u2019t want to get down in that level of detail but I think there is lot of things in that line so I wouldn\u2019t try to worry trying to quantify number there.","","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and I want to comeback real quick to one of the categories you highlighted as weak but a little bit less weak that being gum. Hershey\u2019s that this ongoing campaign to try to crowd out the or shrink the gum sets at retailers, get more candy, get more breath fresheners. It seems like that push is about to accelerate on the back of this new product technology that is (indiscernible) I think it's Ice Breakers Ice Cubes product. What are you expecting or I should say where do we stand right now in terms of shelf resets and what are you expecting to happen to market most importantly, what are you certainly assuming in your underlying outlook here for gum in North America?","","Irene Rosenfeld","Well as we said we\u2019re not expecting any dramatic recovery in the category anytime soon. Obviously our emerging markets businesses continues to grow nicely. It's been the developed markets that have been a challenge and within that the U.S. We have made great progress from a shared standpoint and it's been driven by the steps that we took to address that, it's been about our shelf resets, our focus on some of the core benefits like freshness and oral care. It's been execution at point of buying and as well as the product assortment on shelf. So we\u2019re going to continue to use that play book we have got a nice pipeline of innovations coming behind some of the focus on freshness for example and we have got a number of test in place to address the long term growth of the category that we\u2019re hoping will start to improve. So we remain quite committed to the gum category, we do see our competitors taking a number of actions and we actually think that will be good for the category overtime.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.","","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","I wanted to just follow-up on your candy business specifically and maybe this is just a surrounding issue but my recollection was that the business through the nine months was grown closer to mid-single digits and today you cited more of the low single digit figure for your own sales despite the category being up 4.5%. Can you talk about any specific challenges you\u2019re facing in that business and initiatives you might be investing behind next year to address them?","","Irene Rosenfeld","We continue to see that as a nice growth engine for us. There have been some puts and takes on that business for example our Halls U.S. business has been a little weaker year-over-year because of the flu season up until the end of last year was not quite as robust as it has been a year ago. We have seen some challenges in China on our chocolate Eclairs business but net-net candy continues to be a quite an attractive category and we do expect that that will play an important role in our growth algorithm going forward.","","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Would you expect to be able to grow in-line with the category next year or is there a period of investing?","Irene Rosenfeld","There is nothing. We have got a nice pipeline of innovation and we would expect to grow in line with the category in 2014.","","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And then just one additional question on Europe, it seems like you have good momentum behind the Tassimo business, you have also been launching the compatibles and other things. Given that expectation for some pretty substantial margin expansion next year and they need to be very focused in where you are investing, is that a business where you would expect to continue increasing support next year?","","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes. Well, within our European portfolio, the on-demand and convenient coffee has reflected in Millicano have been the key drivers not only of our revenue growth, but also of our margin improvement. So those are critical enablers in our European and our Eastern European businesses. So we will continue to invest behind them.","","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks Irene.","","Irene Rosenfeld","Okay.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi, thank you. Two questions. One is in fourth quarter, I thought I saw in the notes that there was $0.03 gain on sale this quarter from asset sales in India, UK, Italy, just very quickly is that last year or is that this year?","","Dave Brearton","That\u2019s this year. Last year, we had a very similar number, but it was in prior quarters and it was in Russia and Turkey last quarter. I think the simple way to think about is when we bought Cadbury in a little we have got a lot more facilities underneath them and we are just claiming that up, because it reduces our cost of maintaining these over time.","","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","How much operating income did that contribute in fourth quarter?","","Dave Brearton","I mean every $0.01 for us is about $25 million of OI, so\u2026","","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. So put a regular tax rate on it. So well that set up the tough comparison for next year, because you are leaving it in your adjusted base here for operating income gains, isn\u2019t it?","","Dave Brearton","Yes, it\u2019s in the adjusted base as I said. We are still doing cleanup. I mean, I am not going to make a guidance number that will give every quarter, but I don\u2019t view it as a material headwind for us, no.","","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. And then the final question is of that $0.15 to $0.20, how much would you characterize as really good visibility like we know how much overhead we are cutting, we know that our marketing dollars are going to, if it sounds like the code here is that marketing dollars are going to be maybe flat, maybe even down in 2014?","","Dave Brearton","No, I think as you look at the $0.15 to $0.20, it\u2019s going to be the combination of a few things. Number one, we are growing revenue around 4%, so that\u2019s the good start. We are fully pricing commodities in Forex and so while that\u2019s not necessarily margin a increment, it gives us the opportunity to take more of that productivity to the bottom line. So we would expect gross margins to improve and we have got good momentum on the overhead programs that we started during the year \u2013 this year. We expect to see that continue into next year and that\u2019s going to be a big driver. So the drivers of the $0.15 to $0.20 in operating gains are the double-digit OI growth. As we have talked about \u2013 in our view pretty much within our control and that\u2019s why we are fairly confident.","","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","So I completely understand, the 4% organic income \u2013 organic sales growth includes pricing to cover transactional currency, is that right or it does not?","","Dave Brearton","Yes, it does. So I think that past year, all our revenue growth came from pretty much all of it came from volume mix. I think it will be more balanced in 2014, because we are putting in pretty material pricing in emerging markets and in the Chocolate Dairy categories to be covered by commodity.","","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","But it\u2019s the only purpose of that pricing is to offset the higher costs, isn\u2019t that; yes you say neutral to operating income growth?","","Dave Brearton","It would be neutral to operating income growth other than make sure that our gross margin is protected, so the net productivity can drop or significantly more of the net productivity can drop through. So it\u2019s more a question of yes, there will be some portion that is volume mix and that will drop through the OI, but probably more important than that, it gets us more of the net productivity dropping through when the gross margin bounces.","","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you David.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein.","","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Good evening everyone.","","Irene Rosenfeld","Good evening.","","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Can we ask first of all about China, where quarter on now are you done with the trade inventory rationalization? Do you have any better visibility into when that business might start to stabilize?","","Dave Brearton","Yes. I think the simple answer is yes, we are done with the inventory destocking that all came out \u2013 the end of that came out in the fourth quarter. And as we look at first, the start to the year, we would say the businesses are pretty stable putting already, but we are feeling good about the business already. What we warned about was more about how the comparisons look versus prior year. Last year, we had very strong growth rate in the first half. It\u2019s only possible, more difficult than the first half. And obviously we didn\u2019t have a terrific back half so we are costing in a much easier in the back half. But in absolute dollar shipments and time is going out the door, I think we are already in a pretty good run-rate month over month.","","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","And then coming back to free cash flow guidance it looks as though I think you were talking about 1.4 billion at least in 2014 when you did the math on the numbers that you shared earlier. Why this slowdown? Is it just that you\u2019re taking off the improvements in the cash conversion cycle this year and saying the underlying numbers are about that level?","","Dave Brearton","The cash provided by operating activities which is a combination of our earnings and the cash conversion cycle essentially is the same and we said 4.1 plus because hopefully we will do better than that. So we\u2019re not taking our foot off the gas on the cash conversion cycle, the reason it slows down at the bottom is because the CapEx we started spending about 4% of CapEx we said we were probably going to spend around five for the next 2, 3, 4 years and in 2013 we\u2019re kind of half way between we got up to 4.5%. We will probably spend 5% of CapEx in 2014. So that\u2019s the biggest reason you see the slowdown the other piece is the restructuring spending which is basically is more skewed to 2014 less skewed to 2013 so there is a bit of phase in there. But in aggregate across the two years we\u2019re actually spending a little bit less CapEx and we\u2019re spending the same amount of restructuring. So that\u2019s phase in place.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Bumgarner from Wells Fargo.","","John Bumgarner - Wells Fargo","I read your data, as you look at the landscape in China, we have seen some recent news in terms of Hershey\u2019s doing a deal, why we ain\u2019t be involved with JVs. Is there anything in the country either with the change in leadership or otherwise or maybe you think the environment for opportunities strategically is changing or that you can have opportunities as well for kind of build more distribution in that market going forward?","","Irene Rosenfeld","We do see a great opportunity there John and we\u2019re continuing to invest. As we have talked about, we have got over a $1 billion business there to-date. We just watched gum about a year ago with a sizeable $100 million business for us and overtime you will see us continued to invest in the country. So I think the mechanism by which we choose to invest may vary from category to category and from company to company but it is a big growth opportunity for us and as we see the biscuit category we cover we\u2019re quite confident that China will continue to be a growth engine for us.","","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of (indiscernible).","","Unidentified Analyst","Are you concerned that the inflation that some Latin American countries are experiencing is that ultimately consumers\u2019 willingness to spend on the product that you sell and therefore limits your presence on this country?","","Dave Brearton","Yeah I think that\u2019s basically an Argentina, Venezuela thing and I think truthfully even last year as I talked about earlier the growth in those two countries that we got was basically for pricing and part of through vol mix. So yes consumers are trading down to lower priced brand and their having to monitor their cash carefully. So Argentina and Venezuela have been continued to be difficult markets. I think it's truthfully not a lot different today than it was a year two ago in Venezuela. Argentina may have gotten a little bit worse but we\u2019re pretty experienced with the (indiscernible) those markets.","","Unidentified Analyst","You really have not gone through that your pricing power might diminish eventually?","","Dave Brearton","I think it's not as much of a consumers, but consumers and most companies are pretty used to having do business in these countries but maybe regulatory issues. Last Argentina put in price controls for a while and that hurt us a bit but then there was none afterwards. So are the kinds of things that tend to cause a little more short term issue but it tends to be temporary. It's just the way those countries operate.","","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then just an housekeeping question, can you share with us what you expect for interest expense and shares outstanding for our fiscal \u201914?","","Dave Brearton","Yeah I\u2019m not going to give you a shares outstanding although you probably calculate it, we had $2.7 billion buyback last year and we said we will spend between 1 billion and 2 billion this year. I think our interest expense we said that between the interest in shares we would have $0.11 to $0.13 benefit and the benefit is roughly half and half between interest and shares. So interest will be lower mostly because we did, got a little bit less back and we did the debt (indiscernible) and refinancing last year which took down the cost of our long term debt. So that will come down. I think on slide 17 in the presentation, I\u2019m sure we earlier, it identifies that.","","Operator","I will turn the call back over for closing remarks.","","Dexter Congbalay","Hi this is Dexter; if there is any follow-up questions obviously Nick and I will be available for the rest of the evening in fact for the rest of the week.

Please go ahead, sir.","Shep Dunlap - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thank you. And good afternoon. And thanks for joining us. With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Shortly after market close today, we sent out our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors.","During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance.

Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Shep, and good afternoon. We're off to a solid start in 2017, having delivered another quarter of growth on both the top and bottom lines in a challenging environment. While there have been some puts and takes so far, our business is playing out largely as we expected. On the top line, we delivered organic growth of 0.6%, slightly ahead of our expectation, but there's still work to do. Our Power Brands continued to be a strong driver of overall performance, with organic growth up 2.5%, once again outpacing category growth.","A number of our key markets, including Russia, Germany, Southeast Asia, and Mexico delivered strong growth. In addition, India rebounded faster than expected from the impact of demonetization, delivering high single digit growth. In fact, except for North America, all regions delivered solid results. I'll say a few more words about North America in just a few minutes.","On the bottom line, we continue to make significant progress and build on our strong track record of margin expansion. Adjusted OI margin increased by 90 basis points to 16.8%. Overhead savings and productivity drove the improvement, as we continue to deliver operational efficiencies across the business.","Adjusted EPS growth was solid, an increase of 6% at constant currency, driven mainly by operating earnings. And finally, we returned significant capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, with nearly $800 million in dividends and share repurchases.","Consistent with the three pillars of our growth strategy that we shared at CAGNY earlier this year, we continue to invest in our advantage platforms. First, we remain focus on contemporizing our core to ensure that our brands stay relevant to a very dynamic consumer. We're investing in our Power Brands and key markets where we see good returns. For example, in EMEA, Cadbury chocolate grew double digits in India, supported by solid innovations and strong marketing, while our team worked with customers to manage through demonetization.","Southeast Asia was up mid-single digits, which included solid performance in several countries across the market, and the launch of belVita in Indonesia. In Europe, Russia was up double digits with strong volume growth behind Alpen Gold chocolate. And Germany was up mid-single digits, driven by strong performance of our chocobakery platform and Milka chocolate, as well as from expanded distribution of Oreo and TUC biscuits.","In Latin America, Brazil chocolate continues to recover and drove good revenue growth. In addition, Mexico, which remains a source of strength in the region, delivered solid growth with organic revenue up mid-single digits.","At the same time, we're taking actions to manage our non-Power Brands. We expect to close two previously announced divestitures in Q2. Our Australian cheese and grocery business, and part of our French confectionery business, which together represent more than $500 million of revenue. These deals are not only financially attractive but they'll also help us increase our Power Brand mix, improve our growth rate, and expand margins, as we eliminate the resulting stranded costs.","Our second growth strategy is to support expansion into new consumer need states, especially well-being, as well as into geographic white spaces, like chocolate in China and the U.S., and biscuits in Japan.","In the well-being space, we're pleased with the ongoing strength of belVita biscuits, up mid-single digits globally, as well as with the strong launch of Ritz Crisp & Thins in the U.S. And the continued strength of GOOD THiNS crackers. The accelerating growth of well-being products is one of the biggest shifts facing our industry, and we're addressing this with urgency. As we enter the back half of 2017, we have an unprecedented pipeline of innovation, including new items like V\u00e9a as well as renovation of existing products like Triscuit.","In addition, we're actively filling geographic white spaces. In the U.S., our Milka Oreo chocolate bars are off to a strong start as we ramp up to full distribution. In China, Milka chocolate continues to build strong brand awareness and trial. In fact, in Q1, Milka achieved a 2.4% market share and brand awareness reached 40%. In Q2, we'll continue our investment in innovation and white spaces, setting the stage for a strong back half.","The third pillar of our growth strategy is to continue expanding our sales and distribution capabilities. We're pleased that our eCommerce business posted another quarter of exceptional growth, with net revenue up nearly 30%. We're partnering with key e-tailers such as Alibaba and Amazon as they expand their services in new markets. We're also working with our brick and mortar retail partners who remain the foundation of our business.","In addition, we continue to invest in our routes to market. In emerging markets, we're reaching more traditional trade outlets in second and third-tier cities in China and across rural areas of India. We're also working to evolve our coverage in Brazil, to deepen our presence in existing stores while enhancing our impulse portfolio to improve visibility in the hot zone.","In developed markets like the U.S., we're expanding our presence in convenience stores as we roll out on-the-go products like belVita Protein bars and smaller pack sizes of our base brands, which are tailor-made for this channel.","Our investments in flexible packaging capabilities with our lines of the future are now enabling much broader price pack architecture across our key categories. For example, our new Ritz lines can now flex to produce from 2 slugs to 18 slugs in one package, and from 10 crackers to 40 crackers per slug, with minimal changeover waste. This capability enables us to play in new channels and new occasions at competitive margins.","Net-net, our strategy is working, and we remain on track to deliver our full year outlook with improving top line performance as we move through the second half. We're optimistic about our 2017 innovation pipeline, including V\u00e9a, belVita Protein, and Ritz Crisp & Thins in the U.S., new chocobakery products like Milka brownies, Milka Tender Breaks, and Cadbury Roundies in Europe, and Cadbury Dark Milk chocolate in Australia, which provides high cocoa content without the bitterness.","These innovations, together with ongoing white space expansions, such as U.S. and China chocolate, will ramp up in the second half. In addition, we expect to capitalize on the opportunity to flex our direct store delivery muscle in the U.S., to accelerate share gains in the second half.","Before I turn it over to Brian, I'd like to provide some context on North America. Suffice it to say, we're not satisfied with our performance in this region. We clearly made great progress on margins, but over the past few quarters, we haven't delivered the type of top line growth we expect. This is especially true in our U.S. biscuit business.","While the environment continues to be quite challenging, we're actively working to improve the trajectory of our U.S. business. We have many competitive advantages in North America, our iconic brands, DSD capabilities, now advantaged manufacturing assets, and a robust pipeline of well-being innovation. All of these advantages position us to win over the long-term. But we need to better leverage these assets.","As you know, two weeks ago, we announced a leadership change in the region. Tim Cofer is now serving as Interim President of our North America region, in addition to his critical role as Chief Growth Officer. Tim is one of our most experienced and proven commercial leaders and has successfully demonstrated his expertise in growing our businesses in both developed and emerging markets.","Although it's early days, Tim and the team are focused on fundamentals, fully leveraging our DSD capability, improving sales and marketing execution, delivering our ambitious 2017 innovation plans, and expanding our channel presence. As these initiatives gain traction, we expect to see material improvement in revenue and share in the back half of the year without losing focus on our margin commitments.","Now let me turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in the quarter in more detail.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As Irene stated, it was a solid start to the year in a challenging environment. We're confident that our full year results will be in line with expectations. Given the market conditions, we delivered solid top line growth, with organic net revenue up 0.6%. Easter timing was less of a headwind than we anticipated as customers ordered and we shipped late in the quarter to stage the holiday. This will have some impact on our Q2 dynamics, which I'll address in our outlook.","As we discussed in February, the first quarter did also have a minor effect from the 2016 leap year and the timing of Chinese New Year. But in total, the year-over-year impact of the calendar items ended up being pretty immaterial to the quarter. Emerging markets grew 3.5%, while developed markets declined nearly 1%. Our Europe business performed quite well and is off to a good start to the year, but this was more than offset by declines in North America.","Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance. We continue to deliver strong adjusted OI margin expansion, with overhead reductions being the primary driver. Adjusted gross margin decreased 20 basis points as solid net productivity improvements and better pricing were offset by unfavorable mix and higher input costs.","Adjusted OI margin was 16.8%, up 90 basis points. This improvement was driven by another quarter of overhead reductions from zero-based budgeting and global shared service initiatives. Similar to Q4, these results include the cost of investments in innovation and white space expansion that are largely in advance of revenue, which will become more meaningful in the back half of the year and into 2018.","We expect to make even larger growth-related investments in the second quarter, and that will somewhat temper margin delivery in the quarter. But overall, we're on track with our cost agenda and remain confident in our path to ongoing margin expansion, consistent with the targets we've given you.","Now let me provide some insight into our regional performance. One of the real strengths of our model is our broad geographic footprint, which allows us to balance weaker markets against stronger ones. In general, we're seeing positive trends in three of our four regions, and they're performing at or above our expectations. Several of our key markets are showing encouraging signs, so even with a few tough markets, we are, in aggregate, well-positioned for good 2017 performance.","Europe delivered another quarter of solid margin expansion, with an increase in adjusted OI margin of 60 basis points. Margins now stand at 19.5%. The Q1 margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity, as well as lower overheads, which offset some incremental A&C investments.","Organic net revenue was up 1%, driven by volume. Strong programming in both biscuits and chocolate fueled the growth, despite a continued deflationary environment. We also saw good overall performance in Germany and Russia chocolate, offset by weaker performance in the UK chocolate business as heavy promotional spending in the category continued to pressure short-term results. We believe our Europe performance is differentiated, with good growth and strong margins, and provides a great example of our business strategy in action.","In EMEA, our team is managing well in a volatile set of markets. Adjusted OI margin declined 60 basis points to 14.6%, driven primarily by increased A&C support, which offset lower overhead costs and good productivity. Organic revenue increased 1.3%, led by solid growth in India and Southeast Asia.","Our China business declined due to the timing of Chinese New Year and softer results in biscuits. However, we delivered good growth in chocolate, as our Milka brand continued to perform well and we continued to gain share in gum. We expect the upcoming relaunch of Oreo this summer to provide positive momentum to the biscuit category for the balance of the year. The Middle East continues to be challenging, but we'll face easier comps as we enter the second half of the year.","In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased over 500 basis points to nearly 16%, primarily driven by improved overhead costs and lower A&C spending, as we've adjusted our spending levels to the realities of the market in Brazil. Organic net revenue increased nearly 4%. Mexico grew mid-single digits, driven by solid growth in gum, candy and meals, while Argentina grew high teens through pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.","Brazil remains difficult due to persistent economic weakness. We posted another good quarter in chocolate but continue to experience pressure in biscuits due to price gaps and significant down trading. We expect Brazil will continue to be tough and have factored that into our forecast.","Finally, in North America, we again delivered solid margin expansion as adjusted OI margin improved by 50 basis points, primarily driven by ongoing overhead savings. Adjusted OI margin for the quarter was 20.8%.","As Irene mentioned, our challenges in North America are top line related. Specifically, the region posted a decline of 1.9%, driven primarily by U.S. biscuits but also impacted by gum. We're taking steps to stabilize the business, putting in place experienced operating leadership and investing more heavily in brands that have momentum. These actions give us confidence in our second half plans.","Despite disappointing top line results in aggregate, there were bright spots in North America, including belVita, which gained more than 1 point of share, and the launch of Ritz Crisp & Thins late in the quarter, which helped drive a 0.5 point of share improvement for the brand. Gum decreased due to continued category and consumption declines in the U.S., while candy was flat, driven primarily by the timing of Easter. We continue to see good share momentum and profit contribution from candy brands like Sour Patch Kids, which has become a consistent star.","Now let me spend a few minutes providing some highlights by category. Snacking category growth declined about 2.5%, a number that was significantly impacted by the year-over-year calendar impact from Easter. We remain comfortable with our full year view of category growth. In this environment, we're pleased that our shares improved, with solid results in all categories. Our biscuits business posted a slight revenue decline as strong growth in countries like the UK, Japan and Italy was offset by weakness in the U.S. Approximately 80% of our revenue grew or held share.","In chocolate, our business grew more than 5%, driven by solid results in Germany, India, and Brazil. In addition, we continue to see good momentum with our recent launches of chocolate in the U.S. and China. Approximately 65% of our revenue grew or held share in this category.","Gum and candy declined over 5% as the gum category continues to experience significant weakness, especially in the U.S. We're planning for continued declines in the gum category as we focus on growing our share and improving in-store execution. As you know, this is a highly profitable but relatively small business for us. We'll also continue to shift our focus to our strong, growing and highly profitable candy platforms. About half of our revenue in gum and candy gained or held share.","Turning to earnings per share, in Q1, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.53, which was up 6% on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven by our strong operating income results. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the full year.","As Irene mentioned during the quarter, we returned approximately $800 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion for the full year.","Now to the outlook. Overall, we're reaffirming our outlook. The first half is generally playing out as we expected, although we do see slightly different dynamics between the quarters. We delivered better growth in margins in Q1 than our forecast, as the first quarter was less impacted by the Easter shift than anticipated.","In Q2, the year-over-year compare will be more difficult and we expect North America to remain challenged. Due to these factors, we expect Q2 revenue growth below Q1, with improving growth in the second half. In terms of margin, the second quarter will be affected by higher growth investments and the timing of some spending that shifted from Q1 to Q2.","For the total year, we continue to expect to deliver on our outlook. We continue to expect organic net revenue growth of at least 1%. We expect adjusted OI margin in the mid 16% range, as well as double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. And with respect to free cash flow, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2 billion for the year, as we see lower CapEx, improved margins, and good working capital efficiency.","With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a few closing comments before we take your questions.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. So, to wrap up, we're off to a solid start and expect to build momentum in the back half of the year, as we benefit from white spaces, launch exciting on-trend innovations, and leverage our U.S. DSD network. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our significant margin commitments this year, and are on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. We'll continue to make disciplined investments to drive balanced growth on both the top and bottom lines. And we remain committed to compelling capital returns to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","With that, let's open up the line for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. I was pleasantly surprised by your organic sales growth this quarter. I mean, we've seen some data and you guys referred to it regarding your categories on a global basis, so you've talked about some of the holidays, some of the calendar shifts that affected you. I'm just curious, were there any other maybe non-recurring timing issues that either maybe helped or hurt this period, because you've had so many new products in the market, I'm just wondering were your shipments and your consumption more or less aligned this quarter, or were they a little bit out of order. I'm just trying to get a better sense of that.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, Ken, I'd say they're generally aligned. The biggest impact, of course, is the Easter timing, and so there's a lot of noise because of that shift. We shipped \u2013 as Brian mentioned, we shipped much of our Easter volume in Q1, but we'll get the consumption coming when the holiday happened in Q2.","If you were to adjust for Easter and non-measured channels, which is a smaller impact, like-for-like category growth would actually be about 1% and our snacks revenue was up about 0.8%, so there's actually pretty close correspondence there. As we said, from a pacing standpoint, the first half is going to come in essentially where we expected it. We're going to see some shift from first quarter to \u2013 from second quarter into first quarter, so first quarter a little higher, second quarter a little lower. The first half will come in essentially where we thought.","The second half will be a little bit higher driven by some of the phenomena that I mentioned, the white spaces, the strong innovation pipeline, and our investment in flexing our DSD muscle. So net-net, there's no change to our full year forecast, but there's really no impact in this first quarter. The biggest impact is the Easter timing.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. And then quick follow-up from me. I thought you said that the comparison in the organic sales growth number, and forgive me if I heard this wrong, was a little more difficult in the second quarter than the first. Maybe you were talking about total revenue growth? Because I see the comparisons a little bit easier, actually, in the second quarter. Or are you talking earnings maybe?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, it's more of a top line comment, Ken, and it's specifically North America's year-over-year compares are challenging. It doesn't quite look that way because even in 2015, there were some unusuals that made 2015 good too. So, as we look like-for-like versus 2016, it's a little bit of a tougher compare and North America will be a drag for us in the second quarter.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, everybody.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just two questions from me, I guess. One would be, with North America results more challenging, you've said you're expecting, obviously, some benefit in the second half from a shift in the sort of competitor, sort of distribution model. It might be early, but I guess, have you seen anything yet that gives you more confidence in that thinking, whether it be information coming from your sales people on the street or your key retail partners, things of that nature?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","It's a little early, Andrew. I'd say they're spending pretty heavily on their way out right this minute. So I would say right now is probably not a great example. And thankfully the big impact will be in the back half of the year when they've exited. So it's a little too early to tell, but we are certainly doing everything we can to make sure that our guys are staged with support that they need and the focus that they need to get to drive our share.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","And given the timing, Andrew, it could be one of the issues we face in Q2 as they exit. More aggressive behavior in Q2 that we might see play out.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay, thanks for that clarity. And then Brian, I know this was the toughest year ago, certainly, gross margin comp that you're going to see all year.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, obviously, you still had negative volumes in the quarter so that didn't help. I guess, I'm trying to get a better sense of maybe what type of gross margin expansion we're seeing on a like an underlying basis? I'm trying to judge where it goes from here as the comps on gross margins start to ease and volume as you go through the year presumably gets somewhat better. I didn't know if we're still likely to see, I guess, a lower year-over-year gross margin in 2Q, and then it starts to expand in the back half or could we start to see the gross margin trend improve year-over-year really in this quarter?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, look, I don't want to get into that calling individual quarters on something like gross margin. I think the underlying dynamics for what we're driving here feel pretty good. Net productivity execution continues to be very good. We delivered what we expected in the quarter. We are making some investments in, as you would expect, some product renovations and some of the quality initiatives we have that are affecting productivity, but it was still very good even on a net productivity as reported.","We had higher pricing, as you would see in the P&L, but most of that's driven by places like Argentina, Nigeria, Egypt, some of those highly inflationary markets. There are some places in Europe, where we've made some pricing investments as you look at the annual retailer negotiations and how they've played out, and I think those were good decisions based on the trend we see in Europe right now.","So, I mean, there's some moving pieces as well with mix, so if you think about markets like the U.S. and the UK and the global gum business, I'd put China in there as well, those tend to be higher-margin markets, and those have been some of the markets that have struggled a little bit in terms of top line. So those are the moving pieces.","I think the trajectory over a longer period of time, we continue to see gross margins expand as we move over the next year, but it's hard to call some of those individual dynamics. We'll continue to execute on the productivity, I know that. We've got pricing that's still moving through in those highly inflationary markets. But again, we're focused on the OI margin commitment and the 90 basis points feels pretty good. So, we're kind of controlling what we can control in a pretty volatile market.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Chris Growe from Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good evening.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Just two questions from me as well. A bit of a follow-on to Andrew's question in relation to gross margin. I've heard you talk about price pack architectures and the capabilities that you have there. I'm just curious, the degree to which mix, and I guess, I put that into mix, should benefit the sales and gross margin, if you will, for the year? Is that something you could discuss in some broader detail?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Well, it's clearly a focus for us, and as you think about the investments we've made with lines of the future, that was one of the key elements, key assets that we put in place was much more flexibility there. I think it's \u2013 that element of mix is clearly one that's been moving in the right direction as we've done quite a bit of work there. I think it will accelerate, but, again, it's within this context of other moving pieces within gross margin. We do think it's a real asset. It's a real incremental capability that we haven't necessarily had, and allows us to manage through moving up margins where we can but not having to price on its face with customers. So I think it's a real asset, and not really going to call out what the impact in gross margins is. I think it'll be increasing as we get those capabilities up and running everywhere.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Just one other question, if I could ask, in relation to overhead, which was down, and a contributor, if you will, to lower SG&A. Could you cite (33:12), where your overhead is or what sort of progress you're making on that front and how sustainable that is?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","I think it's \u2013 you've seen us continue to make progress really quarter after quarter here. It is still a focus and a big area of priority. We've shown you some of the progress we've made within some of the ZZB activities, and I think for the most part, the majority of those cost packages are either in top quartile or second quartile performance, and we feel pretty good about that. Shared services, we're, I would say, a little bit more than 75% of the way through the implementations that we have in front of us, and there'll be some additional benefits that play out during 2017. But we feel very good about where overheads are. And, again, it's a little bit of a mixed bag, because we are making some investments in route-to-market and some other parts of business, so that's one we have, probably, the highest confidence in the whole P&L.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Can you say what level your overhead is today, percentage of sales?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","No, It is within (34:19) SG&A, we've kind of shared with you where A&C spending is and A&C spending has continued to be about the same. I mean, it's up a bit year-over-year in the first quarter, but you can kind of back into where overheads have gone?","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Sure. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Two quick ones for me. Brian, and maybe I might have missed this, but did you give a CapEx forecast for this year?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","We did. In CAGNY, we shared a framework that said about 4.5% of net revenue this year, and we showed that the trend will actually move down below \u2013 under or about 4% as we get to 2018. So we're on that trend down as we've kind of worked our way through some of the bigger investments related to lines of the future. So, 4.5% for this year is the current call on that one.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess, a follow-up on North America, one of the things that we've seen is there's been so much growth in small format and sort of maybe non-measured channels as well, and so for your biscuit business, has that had an effect on the growth and that you need more sort of resources in some of these emerging channels and you're right now maybe a little bit too resourced on large format, the channels that aren't growing as fast?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","No, we certainly anticipated this shift over \u2013 we've watched this shift over the last couple of years, Bryan, so we actually have someone in our North American organization who is in charge of channels and his focus for us is on the growth opportunities, particularly in our case, it's primarily about club and C stores. And then \u2013 and we have a separate organization, actually, that is driving eCommerce. So we are resourced to address it. Frankly, the hold up for us was the packaging capability to address these channels. And that's why I'm so pleased with the progress that we've made as we've got these lines of the future up and running because that's the flexibility that we need to be able to go from big pack sizes to small pack sizes. But a critical piece of our growth plan is our ability to be able to improve our share in some of the less traditional channels that have been historically our bread and butter.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks, everyone. So, I wanted to come back to North America again first and ask about some of the evidence of renewed private label growth in selected categories. This seems to be a particular issue in the cookie business right now. Just curious for your take on to what extent that's being driven by some shift at the consumer level or whether it's something that's more explicit retailer led initiative?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, we're not seeing that as a macro issue. There's no question. We've actually found that the penetration of private label, even in our biscuit segments, has not changed dramatically over the last little while. So that hasn't been a factor. We think the bigger issue, without a doubt, has been the shift toward well-being, and that's been a key piece of our focus on renovating our base brands like Triscuit or introducing products like GOOD THiNS as well as launch \u2013 the launch of a product like V\u00e9a, which is a new whole-grain product that we will be introducing in July. So that's been more of a factor for us. And I think a lot of the steps that we're taking, particularly with the innovation pipeline I described, are designed to address that opportunity.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Irene. And Brian, you talked last quarter about the need to do a better job on trade optimization. I'm just curious whether, in the current environment, this is something you're comfortable trying to address more actively or given the negative price mix we're seeing in developed markets, are you going to continue to tread more cautiously here and be a little bit more tactical?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, look, I think we're executing the program. We talked a bit about our investment in some resources and data, and we are finding opportunities where we're improving returns on promotional spending. And I think that's been on track. Now, the reality is, we've had to spend some of that back, and we've seen the benefits. We can find that in the P&L, but then we're also seeing areas where it's important that we spend some additional trade back. And that's sort of the dynamic that we've got playing out. So we're continuing to try and educate customers with the data analytics that suggest that heavy promotional spending just doesn't really work to grow categories. And I think that's a real market by market sort of dynamic, but again, we're executing the net revenue management activities pretty well. We're finding benefits and opportunities there. But we're consciously spending some of that back. And as a result, it's not as big a benefit showing up in the P&L.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks again.","Operator","And our next question is from Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. So just kind of a general question on EPS cadence for the year, I know you said you put up, what, 6% adjusted EPS growth in Q1 and you said for Q2 there's, I guess, a bit of a sales come off a bit on a trend basis relative to what we saw in Q1 and maybe there's a little higher investment to the margins not maybe as much on a year-over-year basis. So I'm just curious, I guess, one, if sales, EPS adjusted sales growth was 6% in Q1 and we're double-digit for Q2, should we see, should we expect maybe EPS growth to be a bit lower in Q2 relative to what we saw in Q1 with really the upside for the year coming in the back half? Is that fair?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to get into individual quarters. I would just say I think with the 6% in Q1, I mean, we feel good about as you look at the compares through the rest of the year, we would expect to see some improvement as we move through the year, obviously the better back half with revenue picking up and the innovations that'll drive that and the things that we have confidence in will contribute to that. And we'll continue to execute on costs. So you would expect to see EPS continue to improve as you move through the year. That should be the general framework. And then you have to look at the compares from prior year.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just in emerging markets, it looks like you still put up the, I guess, 3.5% organic sales growth in Q1. On a tiered stack basis, it does look like \u2013 I mean, it's still impressive, but it does look like there was a bit of a deceleration. Is that mainly Brazil, because it didn't sound \u2013 I know you called out India and Russia and a number of markets that actually did well. What would be the main driver of a bit of a deceleration in emerging markets?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, I would say both Brazil and year-over-year China would have been the other one, but we are very pleased with the performance of our emerging markets and we continue to believe that as the macros in those markets recover, we will see our category recover in a corresponding fashion.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","And China was really a \u2013 Chinese New Year timing is a fair driver there. If you look at Q4, organic growth from emerging, it was 1.5% and it moved to 3.5%. I mean, the biggest driver there is demonetization in India which was much, much smaller impact this quarter.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. So, two questions. The first one, with the divestments or the JVs that you're pulling together, but $500 million of revenue is going, are you able to quantify the stranded costs? I know you haven't changed guidance for the year and how quickly you expect to get rid of those stranded costs.","And then my second question is around commodity costs. I was quite surprised to see your commodity costs up this quarter, especially with the major decline in cocoa prices that we've seen coming out of Europe and the U.S., frankly. Do you expect that to get easier going forward and how do you expect the gross margin to develop? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","You got it, Alexia. So stranded costs, I mean, there's obviously \u2013 there's two pieces to each of these, which is what are the stranded costs locally that are controllable by the business that are actionable; and then there's the unallocated sort of corporate. And you'll see us, over the course of the second half of the year, really aggressively deal with the local costs that surround these businesses.","I'm not going to provide a quantification of the stranded costs or dilution impact of these two transactions. We'll give you clarity on that at the end of the second quarter as we close them. One of them has already closed, and the other will close towards the end of the quarter. So we'll give you more clarity, I think, when we get there. But we have good line of sight to make those stranded costs go away. Just, as you know, it takes a little bit of time and some of that will likely be into the first part of next year.","On commodities, I would just say a couple of things. One, as you think about cocoa, yes, I mean, clearly there has been a fairly significant move in cocoa prices. You have to recognize, I think, that the hedge window for cocoa is longer than, I think, you would expect, and that's really driven by, really our pricing, our ability and the frequency at which we can go after pricing in some of the key markets there. And in some cases, you have annual renegotiations and you want to create certainty in terms of margins in those relationships, so you're going to go out and hedge a little bit further. So, we are hedged longer than, I think, you would expect and therefore don't necessarily have access to the current pricing in this market at this time.","The other thing I would note is that dairy for us is almost as big a buy. And, as you look at what's going on today with dairy, dairy prices are up. We have much less ability, there's much less liquidity in that market to do hedging, so we are absorbing some of the pain associated with dairy. And again, it's not nearly as hedged. So those are the dynamics that are playing out. In the short-term, we are seeing some input cost pressure. It's not huge. It's relatively small when you put all of those things together. And then cocoa, again, it'll be a little bit outside the window of the next few quarters that we start getting some of the benefit of lower cocoa prices.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I had one question but kind of two pieces on North America. And apologies, you guys have talked about the North American issue so much but I got to be honest with you, I'm still not quite clear on really what's wrong. I know you said that sales are not growing at what you expect it to grow, but Irene, frankly, I think you've done a wonderful job with some of these healthier biscuit brands and so forth and maybe better, much better than most of the other players in the category. So that doesn't feel like anything that's wrong. It feels like a positive. So I don't \u2013 I know you said it's not growing the way you want it grow, but I don't really know what's wrong with it, like why isn't it growing this way? And we do note in our data that we see some pretty heavy promotional activity from Mondel\u0113z, but maybe it's not getting the lift that you want it to get, but maybe you could spend a moment to talk about kind of the heart and soul of what's wrong in the business as you see it?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, first of all, I'm very, very pleased with many of the things that the North American team has done and these are tough times. So as we said, there are many things going the right way. But we have a very unique set of advantages in that market. It starts with our DSD selling organization, but we have incredible iconic brands and we have very significant marketing support. And with all of that, I would expect us to be able to outgrow the category. So part of the challenge in North America has been that the category has been under some pressure. We own that category, and we need to figure out how to drive that category more aggressively. So I would say that's the biggest issue in North America is our biscuit business.","I do think that the work that Tim Cofer and the North American leadership team are focused on in the near-term is exactly the right work, which is just blocking and tackling in terms of sales and marketing execution, making sure that we can capture the DSD opportunity, and making sure that we land that pipeline and then as well as the channel, extending the channel presence that we talked about. So they're focused on the right things. We just \u2013 I'd like to see them happen faster because we have been \u2013 had been outgrowing the category for quite some time and it's been a while since that's been the case. And so that's what I'm looking to happen and I think we've got the assets to enable that.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And if I could just do one follow-up on this. You mentioned the DSD muscle like many times on the call. When you say this phrase, can you talk a little bit about how it will manifest itself in store? Is it you would expect larger shelf space for your brands or is it more about the display activity that takes place within the store due to the DSD team? Thank you.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","It's both of those things, David. I mean, it starts with the fact that there will be some shelf space that will be vacated. One of the benefits of a DSD organization is that there's a broader assortment of inventory that is typically carried and the opportunity now for us to get in some of our secondary brands, many of which actually have better velocity than some of the brands that were on the shelf is priority one, but there's also, because of the expandable consumption of biscuits, the opportunity for us to get more product out on the floor is the other big opportunity. So, it's actually the focus will be on both of those things.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good evening. Last quarter you called out discounting both retailer-led, competitor-led, I think, especially in the U.S. and in the UK. Could you describe how that environment is changing, perhaps, both in the competitive and retailer\/customer level versus last quarter?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","We continue to see aggressive discounting in a number of places and those are the two biggest. The good news is we are seeing \u2013 in the UK, in particular, we are starting to see our shares recover. And as I've said a number of times, the biggest opportunity is to redeploy some of that investment to more category building spending. And what we're finding is in cases where there's heavy promotional spending, it just simply does not grow the category. So, we are still seeing here in the U.S. some aggressive promotional spending, and still seeing it to some extent in the UK, but I am hopeful that as we continue to come with strong innovation and a strong selling story that we can get the focus back on brand equity as well as putting products on the shelf that have strong velocities.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I mean, just a follow-up to that, there was a feeling that post-Brexit in the UK, the retailers have taken another \u2013 more aggressive stance and that warfare was supposedly tapering off. Has that not ended as quickly as you would have hoped? And in the U.S., obviously, you're hearing a lot of talk about retailers taking a tougher stance against brands. Is that part of the changed environment that you've seen carry over into this quarter?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Well, Brexit is not over yet, so I would say everyone is still waiting to figure out what the actual rules will be and there's no question it will put some pressure on both the manufacturers and the retailers and, I think, that's a piece of the uncertainty there. Here in the U.S., I think it is \u2013 it continues to be a challenging promotional environment, but I think we've been able to weather the storm reasonably well. I mean, as I mentioned, our share \u2013 our biscuit share has been flat, the challenges is that that's not good enough. We think we can do much better than that.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Which is better than it was. So...","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. It's improved but it's just not where we'd like to see it.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have time for one more question. Our question comes from Steven Strycula from UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. First question for Irene and then I have a follow-up for Brian. Irene when you first guided organic sales for the year on February 7, you commented at least 1% organic sales. And that was a few days before your key competitor communicated a DSD transition. So, I guess, my question is since then, we've heard front-of-store initiatives from CVS and obviously the DSD transition from a competitor, are both of these dynamics baked into your current organic sales guidance for the year? And specifically, are you guys thinking about budgeting share gains in the back half of the year? I'm just trying to assess what kind of upside that we see relative to before or is there any kind of conservatism baked into the full year analysis?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Well, I would still say we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given. And the reality is there are many moving pieces as we've shared with you today. So, we should pick up share in the back half, as I've said, here in the U.S., but there are some offsets to that and so we've got \u2013 there'll be some puts and takes. We still feel very comfortable with our top line guidance of at least 1%, and importantly, our bottom line margin guidance. And in this environment, we think that's the most prudent planning step.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, and then, Brian, for full year gross margins, is there a scenario where we should expect this to be up slightly positive for the year? And Irene, on eCommerce, you guys are growing 30% quite nicely. Where are the puts and takes of that channel growing longer-term? I mean, in terms of clearly getting access to new customer, but from a margin mix perspective, is there anything that maybe is an offset to the opportunity on the revenue front, whether it's unfavorable margin mix for reason X, Y, Z?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, on gross margins, Steve, I wouldn't get into providing an outlook for gross margins for the year. I think we feel good with the long-term trajectory. We think gross margins are going to get better. We've articulated that. I think there'll be puts and takes and moving pieces, quarter to quarter, but, again, the trajectory, I think, we'll continue to see improving gross margins as we move towards our 17% to 18% commitment.","And then on eCommerce, just margins in general, at a (55:17) gross margin line are slightly below as you think about eCommerce as a channel. But when you think about it in total in terms of cash margins that we deliver, we don't necessarily have the same distribution costs associated with serving that channel. So in total we can get to similar margins. And that's basically what we're seeing in the current eCommerce business. Do you want to \u2013 ?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","We also think we can address underserved occasions like gifting, for example, with many of our biscuit and chocolate items that, for example, in the eCommerce channel that actually don't necessarily, will not necessarily even appear in retail. So our commitment, as we talk about the $1 billion business that we are targeting by 2020, our expectation is that that will have margins that are as good, if not better, than our regular \u2013 than the rest of our portfolio.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great.

We delivered very solid results for the third quarter. We continue to build momentum on the top line while increasing both adjusted growth and operating margin, and we delivered another double-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share. Our third quarter organic net revenue grew 1.2%, which includes 60 basis points of headwind for onetime malware effects last year, and it was supported by positive volume growth. We also delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18% at constant currency and solid free cash flow, which is now $1.1 billion year-to-date. As I laid out at our Investor Day last month, we are excited about the growth potential of snacking. Vibrant categories like chocolate and biscuits are growing faster than other areas in food. I want to thank many of you for attending and giving us an opportunity to share our vision and priorities around growth, execution and culture. Mondelez is well positioned to lead the future of snacking, thanks to our unique portfolio of iconic global and local brands and our advantaged geographic footprint.","Nearly 40% of our revenues come from fast-growing emerging markets, which we expect will disproportionately contribute to future snacking growth. In the third quarter, emerging markets continue to show strong momentum and delivered an increase in revenues of 6%. This was driven by positive volume and pricing with particular strength in Russia, India, Mexico, China, South East Asia and Africa. Excluding Argentina, emerging markets grew 4.5%.","In North America, as we discussed with you before, we are working to address several issues in our business which, as expected, continue to impact results. On the biscuits consumer side, overall consumption and our share were positive with key brands such as Oreo, Ritz and belVita performing well, but we have more work to do to improve our service delivery.","Over the past couple of years, we've already made significant changes in North America, and we are now producing around 60% of our volume on advantaged assets in the region. We are continuing with additional end-to-end investments in capacity, systems and people, and we are seeing the progress. However, it will take us time to fix and, as such, progress will not be linear.","Turning to our long-term growth strategy. I would like to share with you the progress we are making towards our strategic growth priorities. But before I do, let me remind you what they are. First, we are accelerating consumer-centric growth. Second, we are driving operational excellence in everything we do. And third, we are building a winning growth culture. Our long-term goal is to deliver volume-led top line growth that translates into high single-digit adjusted EPS growth and attractive free cash flow generation. Unlocking further growth requires us to put the consumer at the heart of our work. We will do so by further contemporizing our brands, capitalizing on untapped growth opportunities in channels and geographies and overhauling our marketing and innovation agenda. Let's look at innovation in a bit more detail.","As I explained at our Investor Day, we're implementing a more agile innovation model founded on the test, learn and scale principle and grounded in local consumer insights. A good example of this is the recent introduction in Europe of Joy Fills, an innovative product platform that we're launching under the Oreo, Cadbury and Milka brands at the same time. Our European team has taken this idea to market in record time, creating an entirely new product format for consumers to munch on. Imagine it as a crispy, pea-sized biscuit with a creamy filling that offers a light, but indulgent, treat. Early indications are positive, and we're looking forward to seeing more.","Over in India, our recently launched Lickables product continues to do well with consumers, helping deliver 90 basis points of chocolate share gains year-to-date in a market where we already have strong leadership. And here in the U.S., Oreo, which is already posting a mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, is getting ready for the launch of the biggest Oreo cookie yet, the Most Stuf edition.","While we're driving the test, learn and scale model in local markets, we're simultaneously dialing up our overall commitment to innovation with a platform called SnackFutures, which will be dedicated to unlocking future snacking growth opportunities around the world. SnackFutures will bring together internal and external talent to drive 3 mandates: inventing new businesses and brands in key strategic areas, reinventing smaller brands with untapped potential and creating ventures with early-stage entrepreneurs to seek new businesses. We are excited about the potential of this platform to help us drive the future of snacking. We will share more with you in the coming weeks about this.","Another route to drive additional growth is M&A. Our recent acquisition, Tate's Bake Shop, performed well in the quarter, growing strong double-digit, above our expectation, as it continues to ramp up distribution in the U.S. We remain excited about this platform and the opportunity we have to scale the business while preserving what makes it unique.","Turning to the second pillar of our strategy. We remain highly focused on our driving -- on driving operational excellence in all facets of our business. In recent years, we have focused mainly on productivity improvements, and we continue to make progress in this area.","In the third quarter, we drove productivity even further, which helped to deliver 110 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin to 40.6%. Beyond this, we are also looking to drive end-to-end improvements in our processes and systems to help make us more efficient and, specifically, to iron out the operational challenges that are impacting North America.","Finally, we remain committed to changing not just what we do but how we do it by building a winning growth culture. As such, we are altering our ways of working to provoke a shift in mindset and behaviors. Starting January 1, we will shift to a new local commercial structure that will drive greater consumer focus and reduce the complexity caused by organizational overlap, but we will continue to manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale. We are creating 13 geographic business units, each reporting into one of our 4 regions. This move clarifies accountabilities, and we are aligning our incentive structure to drive greater ownership of local business results. We believe this change will enable volume-driven top line growth and absolute profit dollar growth. With the rollout of this new structure in the regions, we will create a more agile company that can react faster to local consumer preferences without losing the benefits of our scale and global expertise in marketing, manufacturing and innovation.","We have also announced today that Hubert Weber, Executive Vice President and Regional President of our European business, has decided to retire from the company at the end of January. Hubert has led our European business during a period of exceptional change, delivering a strong track record in terms of profitability and setting up this important region for future growth. We thank him for his 29 great years with the company and wish him all the best. Hubert will be replaced by Vinzenz Gruber, currently President, Western Europe, who brings extensive marketing and commercial experience as well as strong leadership credentials both from within this company and outside. We are confident Vince will step in right away and continue to build on the great momentum we have in our European business.","During our Investor Day, I also talked about our purpose, which is to empower people to snack right, a purpose we believe we can fulfill by providing the right snack at the right moment, made the right way. We are already seeing compelling evidence of our new purpose in action. Our ambition to produce snacks the right way, for instance, is manifested in our recently announced commitment to ensure that all our packaging is recyclable by 2025. And we strongly believe that if we make our products the right way, our consumers will continue to choose our beloved and iconic brands for years to come.","In summary, our third quarter results were solid. Our year-to-date momentum continues, and we are well set to deliver our commitments for the year. The underlying strengths of our snacking categories, particularly in emerging markets, together with our early progress on our strategic initiatives, gives us confidence that we are on the right track to generate attractive, long-term total returns for shareholders.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Luca.","Luca Zaramella","Thanks, Dirk, and good afternoon. We performed well across a number of financial metrics and continued to see good revenue and volume momentum as well as solid margin performance that is consistent with our outlook. Organic net revenue increased 1.2%. This top line performance includes a headwind of 60 basis points related to the lapping of the malware recovery. Emerging market performance stands out in the quarter as it was broad-based with strong volume growth. China, India, Mexico, Russia, Southeast Asia and Africa all delivered good results. These results reflect solid execution by our commercial teams as well as robust market dynamics in our categories.","On a regional basis for the quarter, Europe's organic net revenue increased 0.2%, though underlying growth was better as these results included approximately 150 basis points of headwind related to the malware incident. Russia posted mid-single-digit revenue growth and share gains in both chocolate and biscuits. And Germany delivered solid growth in biscuit, where the Milka-branded chocobakery portfolio continues to fuel strong performance.","AMEA grew 4.6%, with broad-based across all key areas. India and Southeast Asia continue to execute well with high and mid-single-digit growth, while China delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of growth fueled by biscuit and e-commerce. We also saw strong double-digit results in Africa.","Latin America grew 4.6%. Although the region was impacted by inflation-driven growth in Argentina, we continued to see good momentum in Mexico, which grew mid-single digits behind both gum and candy. Brazil declined low single-digit in the quarter. We are addressing price gaps and have also made steps around innovation that will help to improve the trajectory of our business in Brazil.","North America declined 2%. While we saw positive U.S. biscuits category and share dynamics, we continued to face a number of operational challenges which impacted volume. As Dirk mentioned, we are making investments in people, processes, systems and capacity to address our operational issues and expect improvements moving forward, although it will take time and progress will not be linear. Let me describe what the nature of the issue is.","While we have invested significantly in North America over the last several years, creating a state-of-the-art greenfield plant in Salinas, Mexico and installing new Lines of the Future in existing plants in the U.S. and Canada, around 40% of our volume is still made on lines that do not provide full reliability. To compound the situation, volume demand growth is putting more pressure on our network.","We are making the necessary investments to stabilize the U.S. factory network while enhancing our capabilities through people and systems as far as supply and demand planning are concerned. We are seeing some progress already, but installing capacity where needed, stabilizing some of the lines, improving our systems and adding capabilities will require some time.","Now let's review our margin performance. In Q3, adjusted gross profit dollars grew more than 4% on a constant currency basis. Positive pricing, net of commodities, and productivity savings drove the margin expansion. We are benefiting from favorable cocoa cost, which was partially offset by continued freight and logistics cost inflation. We also continue to maintain pricing discipline to protect our margins in the medium to long-term and have already announced and taken pricing in a number of countries this year, including our U.S. business, while striking the right balance with volume and overall profit.","Adjusted operating income grew by 4% on a constant currency basis with margins of 17.1%, up 40 basis points as a result of higher gross margins. There were several items in other income and expense line that were unfavorable when compared to prior year, partially muting the gross profit margin expansion. Cost savings in the SG&A line continue to provide offset to inflation.","On a regional basis, gross margin expansion and cost execution drove margin improvements in 3 of 4 regions. Europe grew 110 basis points to 19.8%. North America decreased by 90 basis points to 20.6%, driven by higher conversion costs in U.S. factories and customer service and logistics costs. Latin America increased by 30 basis points to 18.1%, and AMEA improved by 120 basis points to 14.2%.","Now let me take a moment to discuss category highlights. The snacking categories continue to display good dynamics and solid growth, building on the past 4 quarters with growth of 2.7%. We remain encouraged by the overall health of our categories.","Overall, we held or gained share in 60% of our business. Year-to-date, our biscuits organic net revenue grew more than 3%. Approximately 75% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including our U.S., France, China, Germany businesses. In chocolate, our business continues to perform well, growing 3.5%. India, Australia and Brazil all posted growth during the quarter. Approximately 40% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including Germany, Russia and India. Gum and candy growth was flat, reflecting soft but improved results in developed markets. About 40% of our revenue in this business gained or held share, including China.","Now turning to earnings per share. We delivered another strong quarter of adjusted EPS growth, which increased 18% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by favorable operating gains, taxes and share repurchases.","With respect to capital deployment, we returned approximately $800 million in capital to shareholders in Q3 and $2.6 billion year-to-date. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million in stock and paid more than $300 million in cash dividends.","Turning to free cash flow. The third quarter was a solid quarter of cash flow generation as working capital management and higher cash earnings drove results. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Our team remains focused on closing out the year and delivering our full year 2018 target with a strong Q4.","Now let me spend a minute on our outlook for the year. Overall, we now expect our top line outlook for the full year to be approximately 2%. We are encouraged by our top line results as emerging markets trends and overall category growth trends remain solid. We are maintaining our outlook for the year with respect to our adjusted OI margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. As you think about Q4 modeling, second half operating margins should be roughly comparable to the first half of this year.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","So two questions for me. One, I guess, just specifically in the quarter, it looked, I think relative to where we were, you ended up delivering much better in gross profit dollars, but the SG&A was a little bit higher than, I guess, we expected it to be. So look, if you could just walk us through, was that more marketing? Did you -- were you better than expected and spent more back? Or was there other sort of noise that we should just think about that flowed through SG&A in the quarter? And then I have a follow-up.","Luca Zaramella","Yes. Thank you, Bryan. So quite pleased with the gross profit growth, more than 4%. Gross margin, as you said, up 110 basis points, so delivering our commitments. It didn't translate fully into OI margin as last year we had a few positives into the other income line and, this year, we had a few unfavorable items in the other income line that resulted in unfavorable comparisons. But in terms of that specifically, I would say that we did a good job, in the quarter, continuing the cost savings you have seen so far this year, and we have been offsetting inflation. And as far as A&C goes, in general, it is in line with last year, so no major changes. But we have unlocked some more investments, specifically in the quarter in a couple of places where we see good momentum, and there will be more to come in Q4. So it was not -- A&C in total in the quarter, it was not overhead cost, it was the -- some unfavorability this quarter in other income lapping favorability last year as we had asset sales and a little bit of insurance claims that were refunded.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that, Dirk, it's early -- I guess, you're beginning to make early progress against your strategic plan. And I guess, as that's unfolding, could you just sort of give us an idea of how you're thinking about spending levels for 2019 and how should -- we should think about that as we're looking at our models and looking at the opportunities going into next year?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, yes, Bryan. Well, first of all, maybe a little bit on the strategy in general. We had a number of premises in our strategy as we announced it in September. The first one was that snacking is a great place to be in food these days, and the quarter confirmed that with the 2.7% growth of our categories worldwide, even if we had a the significant heat wave in Europe which obviously impacts chocolate sales. And then the other premise was that emerging markets will continue to drive growth, and they were particularly strong in this quarter with 6% growth. So we feel good about those 2 premises, they were confirmed. And then as it relates to the other 3 strategies that we laid out: accelerated consumer-centric growth; we continue with our new marketing playbook; we did a number of innovations that were launched, I talked about a few; and we keep on being focused on M&A, operational excellence. We talked about gross margin. Also, the new organization we're putting in place, the recyclable packaging. And then as it relates to the culture, again, that new organization which pushes accountability closer and the new incentive plan that will reward profit dollars and volume growth. So we're on track, we're making progress on all these 3 strategies and can go deeper into detail if you would like to. But overall, what we're expecting for the spending next year, and we're still, of course, finalizing the plans, but we expect those to be the 4 big areas. The first one would be, of course, A&C; the second one, in overall capabilities of the company; the third one, in quality; and the fourth one, in route to market. The specific levels are probably a little bit early to comment on, but we're expecting those 4 areas to see a significant increase next year.","Bryan Spillane","But fair to say that's still concorporated in the guidance that you gave us for '19 back in September.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, yes, yes. No change there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman","I'd like to ask 1 quick one and then a broader one, if I can. For the fourth quarter -- or for the second half, I think you said that you expect your operating margin on a pro forma basis to be roughly the same as in the first half of the year. I think that implies maybe an operating margin in the fourth quarter lower than the annual average, maybe something like 16.3, 16.4 on a percent basis. Can you confirm that I'm doing my math there, very quickly? I just want to make sure because -- as we think about the modeling.","Luca Zaramella","Look, I think, and as you think about our margin year-to-date, OI margin is around about 16.8%. I think as we guided the full year to approximately 17%, I would say Q4 is around about in line with the year-to-date number.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay. And then I'm following up on that. My broader question is I just wanted to ask about pricing in the U.S. I think the number you had, over 1%, was the best in a few years this quarter, and the comparison was relatively difficult. So can you just help us how to understand a little bit about the balance between list pricing? How much is list pricing driving the success versus lower promotions? I really just want to get a better idea of how sustainable this pricing is because it's obviously a very sensitive topic for many, many CPG companies in the U.S. today.","Luca Zaramella","Look, I think we have work to do in the U.S., quite honestly. But I think pricing and the right balance between volume and pricing is something that we feel quite good about. If you look at the U.S. market and what we have done in biscuit not only this quarter but over the last few quarters, I think you'll see, in consumption terms, a nice balance in biscuit between volume and pricing. So going back to your specific question, we implemented pricing earlier in the year, which was a line pricing increase on some of our local brands, and that is coming in effect now. We have optimized promo spending. And again, I think we found the sweet spot in some of our brands where, I think, there were some inefficient promotions in place. And as I said, we are pleased seeing volume and pricing growth in the marketplace in consumption terms. And we introduced some price pack architecture. So we really used a full array of tools to implement pricing in the U.S. In addition, as we said, we have announced additional pricing across biscuits, gum and candy. And that pricing will be effective as of Q1 next year, and it will be for the vast majority line pricing. I think based on what we see these days, quite happy with the share gains and the balance, as I said. So we have confidence in the fact that this is the right move. And I think, as you look at the sustainability of the category and the ability we have to invest, I think, clearly, given the inflationary pressure we see in some commodities and logistics costs, this is the right thing to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Just two quick ones for me. I'd say, first, to reach 2% organic top line for the full year, I suggest around 1% organic top line in the fourth quarter. Obviously, slower than the 2.3% rate year-to-date and even down sequentially from the third quarter of 1.8%, if you exclude the malware impact. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense, is there something specific that you see is slowing the organic down in 4Q or really just sort of thinking conservatively at this point?","Luca Zaramella","Look, we are clearly encouraged by the top line evolution. And we see clearly momentum, specifically across emerging markets. We are happy with the volume and pricing balance. Categories, as we said, are quite vibrant, specifically in emerging markets. And you said that I think we want to be thoughtful about the fourth quarter. As you know, that's -- in the U.S., there might still be some challenges even if we see improvements clearly in Q4 and in October, specifically. So I think it is just us wanting to be thoughtful about the fourth quarter, and I think we see light to the 2% even in Q4, quite honestly, around about 2%.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. And then I guess, when you think about the 2% to 3% organic top line growth forecast for 2019, I guess, what is the, at least currently, your category growth expectation that's sort of built into that number? And really what I'm trying to get at is how much in the way of share gains are really needed at this stage, your best guess, to hit that 2% to 3% for next year?","Dirk Van de Put","Well, we see the category, so we see them at the moment growing at 2.7%. In our strat plan, we had foreseen that they would be around 3%. Us aiming at 2.5% for next year means that we do not see any market share gain for next year. We are largely aiming to stay in line with the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Can we ask about the product strategy here in the U.S. I've been looking at the Nielsen data, and it seems as though the big launch of the chocolate product a couple of years ago seems to be being undone. Gum seems to be getting a little bit better sequentially. I don't know whether you're putting more investment in there as you also try to migrate one of those brands into the mint segment. Obviously, you've still got the cookie strategy going strongly. I think there may have been some innovations that didn't quite work in crackers. Could you just give us a sort of quick summary of what you're actually focusing on and what the strategy is, product category by product category, here?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. So maybe I'll start with chocolate. Yes, we entered the U.S. chocolate market, which is highly competitive. And we know that it will take some time, but we're trying to leverage the power of the Oreo brand there. I think it's a good example of extending our brands to play in adjacent categories but, obviously, it's going to be a niche type of play. And we see very positive indicators as it relates to Oreo chocolates, a very strong consumer response with the highest repeat rate of any recent innovation in the category. So overall, we think we feel pretty good about it. We just are going through the second year after the launch, and I think it's normal to see a little bit of a decline there. As it relates to gum, yes, the gum market itself has been doing better. We are seeing a very nice category growth coming back in the U.S. And you see a little bit of a better performance from us driven also by a new innovation called Trident Vibes that -- which we have also launched in China under the Stride brand. And we're seeing good results there with an early share taking of 1.2 points. And then, as it relates to cookies, I would say the crackers are relatively flat as we see our shares. But in the rest of the cookie segment, we are seeing quite interesting growth. Oreo is around the mid-single digits. belVita is up quite nicely. Ritz is doing well. So as you saw there, Alexia, we're doing quite well in our cookies approach. But overall, I would say there's some wins and some losses there. But overall, we feel pretty good about how things are going. You didn't mention candy, but Sour Patch Kids is doing quite well in the candy segment. So it's -- yes, there are some ins and outs. But overall, I think, if you look at all the categories, we're increasing our market share.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe","Just had a question for you, if I could. I wanted to ask around the chocolate category where you have seen cocoa cost come down. Are you seeing more competition emerge in that category? I thought you were holding or gaining share, only 40% of the category, yet the sales are strong in the category and for your business as well. So I'm just curious how the competitive dynamic is shaping up in that category.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, the category growth is strong. It's about 3.6%. Our revenue growth was 3.5%, so quite close. Yes, we, at 40%, are holding or gaining share. That is largely due to, I would say, the -- some areas, Australia, New Zealand. We lost some share in France, Sweden. But overall, if I look at the performance, I don't think it's particularly something that we are concerned about. We're seeing big competition showing up. For instance, in chocolates, the overall growth is still quite strong, in mid-single digits overall, but the emerging markets are growing high single digits. And the developed markets maybe took back a little bit in the third quarter. But overall, I think we feel pretty strong about our chocolate performance.","Christopher Growe","Okay, no areas of price competition emerging as costs get a little more favorable there, certainly in cocoa.","Dirk Van de Put","No.","Luca Zaramella","No, I don't think there is really anything to worry about. We are lapping a quite high share number last year in Q3. We gained quite a bit of share across the board. So I think, think about that as phasing. It will come back.","Christopher Growe","Okay. And I just had a quick question to follow up on North America. And before, we have seen the prior year, obviously, the comp issues. But we have seen of late the consumption data weaken a little bit and yet still very strong in cookies, I would say. Can you just react to that and give a little bit of a feel for how that should shape up in the fourth quarter, given some of the lingering issues you've had in that division?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, the lap for cookies versus last year, there was a big buildup for the hurricane last year. So yes, the overall category growth was a little bit slower, but we attribute that largely to a very tough comparison for last year. Year-to-date, we see the category at 1.9%, with our share being up 0.7%. In the last quarter, our share grew a full point. We expect the category to be coming back to higher levels as we don't have that lap effect anymore. So we have no particular indication that the category would be slowing down.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","A two part question. I wanted to ask about Latin America and 3 of your bigger businesses there with Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Given the inflation that we're seeing in some of those markets and volatility around elections, can you talk about how you're managing each of those businesses from both a pricing and a volume strategy and comment on how some of the key competition, whether -- particularly local competition, if it's following? That would be very helpful.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, maybe I'll comment a little bit and then hand it over to Luca specifically on pricing. Overall, in Latin America, we see -- we continue to see very positive organic growth, and I think we're managing well through the emerging market volatility. The revenue growth in Q3 was driven largely by Argentina and Mexico, and Brazil declined. I'll leave it up to Luca to comment a little bit on Argentina and the situation there. Mexico, we are very positive. We had a very solid performance, mid-single-digit, and gum and candy continued to be very strong. And then in Brazil, yes, we had a decline, which was in line with expectations. But the good thing there is that we are addressing some of the chocolate price gaps that we've had in the beginning of the year, and that is helping us to regain some market share in chocolate. So we feel pretty good about that. Overall, I would say, as it relates to management, Mexico, we don't see a particular need. Argentina, seeing the high inflation, yes, we need to be very vigilant. And then -- and again, Luca will comment on that. But Brazil, we feel pretty optimistic about next year in Brazil. We see indications that things will improve, and we are counting on a positive sales growth in Brazil for next year. Luca?","Luca Zaramella","So specifically in Argentina, it is around about 2% of our revenue. And given the high inflationary environment, we are managing it, quite frankly, a little bit differently than the other 2 countries that Dirk mentioned, Brazil and Mexico. It is a disciplined approach, the one we are taking, to protecting cash flow and value. In fact, in the quarter and consistently throughout the year, we did double-digit pricing that drove revenue. We're happy with the way we are protecting cash flow and value in that country. In fact, I can tell you that our margin in the quarter was in line with last year. So it is a fine line between understanding how to price, protecting cash flow and also with the look of not losing too much scale in the country as it is tough to see it, but I think, potentially one day, that is a country with a sound economy that could grow and be a good business for us. So it is a fine balance, but it is a different way of managing it as we have compared to other countries in Latin America.","Steven Strycula","I have a quick follow-up, if I can. Wanted to ask about the different moving pieces with the coffee business, how you've recasted the financials there. What should we be using as the 2017 baseline for all the coffee equity income from last year? And then, ultimately, not specific guidance, but how would you generically guide it for the full year 2018, again, given the change in reporting that you guys put out there?","Luca Zaramella","No, it is a tricky question to guide you on coffee because, clearly, KDP is a publicly traded company. And that is one of the reasons we decided to go on a lag. There was an 8-K earlier in the month, where you can find the detail by quarter. But simply said, the impact of moving us to a lag, it is not going to be material in the year. So I can give you more details, maybe separately, and take you through some of the highlights of the 8-K, but think about consistency with what we said before in the context of double-digit EPS and the synergies that KDP is going to deliver.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Dirk, I think you mentioned new pricing that's going into effect in first quarter across multiple categories. Can you remind us what markets those price increases are going into effect? And if it's in the U.S., what was the pitch to the trade for raising price? Is it to offset commodities or freight? And did you make any kind of product quality improvements to help justify the increase?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, well, I will first comment on North America. As we explained before, we did -- in the middle of the year, we did an increased spread between a line price increase, price pack architecture and a promotional optimization on the local brands that we have. And then we are doing a price increase across the line at the beginning of next year. The -- we will do more of the same as it relates to those 3 mechanisms of increasing prices, but it's a bit more line price increase at the beginning of the year. We believe that it's the right move for us, seeing the overall environment and the way our categories are behaving at the moment. It will allow us to make the right investments in our brands and in our categories. So at this stage, we think that is probably the best way to do it. Of course, there are cost pressures also related to this as it relates to freight and some commodities, the trade is well aware of that. So they understand that, that is some of the reasons why we are doing those price increases. Around the world, I would say it's a little bit the same story, although less pronounced. We're doing some price increases in other countries, but it is not of the magnitude that we have to do in North America. Luca?","Robert Moskow","Okay. In chocolate -- go ahead.","Dirk Van de Put","Sorry. Excuse me?","Robert Moskow","I wanted to follow up on chocolate in Europe, whether that is included in the price increases in the first quarter or no pricing?","Luca Zaramella","Look, we cannot comment on specific pricing actions. As we said about pricing, the vast majority of pricing, it is coming in effect in emerging markets, excluding Argentina. We are pleased with what we see there. I think, if you look and extract Argentina from the number of emerging markets, you see a growth that is 4.5%. It is underpinned by pricing, but there is also a nice component of volume. So think about pricing being in effect in emerging markets pretty much on the vast majority of those markets. And we are watching closely volume dynamics because we don't want to lose momentum, and we want to preserve that operating leverage that is the foundation of the plan we presented at the Investor Day.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","One quick clarification. I think you said that the first half operating margin, which I think was 16.7%, and the second half operating margin will be same as first half, but then the full year guidance is like 17%. Can you just clear that up for me just for -- and I hate to be so particular on basis points, but it almost sounds like the 2 pieces of the guidance would mathematically come out with a number below 17%. And maybe that is the right answer. But can you just clear that up right now?","Luca Zaramella","Yes. So as I said, on a year-to-date basis, the margin is 16.8%. I think it was around about 16.7% in the first half. As we guided to approximately 17%, see Q4 pretty much in line with both the first half and the Q3 year-to-date number. So it will be approximately 17%, a little bit below and in line with the full year guidance we gave.","David Driscoll","Okay, that's fine. And then on the U.S. pricing that you have going into January 1, what was the size of the price announcements that you made implementing on January 1?","Luca Zaramella","We are not getting into specific details. But as we said, it would be across the 3 categories: biscuit, gum and candies. And it will be different by brand. And we have looked into potential elasticity impacts, and we are trying to strike the right balance between preserving the volume and pricing momentum that we see in the marketplace these days and preserving margins going forward.","David Driscoll","A final one for me is, volume was positive on the year-to-date basis but negative in the third quarter. When you move into the fourth quarter, does volume turn positive again, leading us into 2019 with the expectation of positive volumes?","Luca Zaramella","Look, this quarter comps are clearly affected by the malware additional shipments last year. But I can assure you that the underlying dynamics are pretty much unchanged versus the previous quarters. I think you should look at the year-to-date volume and pricing balance. And as you look at that, I think what you see is that growth is half attributable to volume and the other half is pricing. Think about those dynamics continuing in Q4, but don't look at Q3 and draw the conclusion that volume was soft because we are lapping malware last year. And I think, again, as you look at the dynamics of emerging markets, Europe and Latin America, it is, quite frankly, in line with what we have seen so far this year.","Dirk Van de Put","And then I would like to add that for 2019, we have studied the elasticity of our price increases quite carefully, so we don't provide any specific guidance on split between volume mix and pricing. But we are working towards that goal of a volume-led growth over the long term, and we feel that the current dynamic we're seeing of the positive volume mix year-to-date that we can continue that into next year.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Dickerson","So I guess, just to, I guess, beat the horse till he's dead, excuse my phrase. Just in terms of 2019 and, as we have stressed, the price increase across the categories, the expectation would that there would still be a balance between the pricing and the volume? Or are we thinking even though the goal, obviously, the target is to have volume-driven top line longer term, that maybe in '19, it's a little bit more tilted to pricing upfront? Is that fair? That's my first question.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. And just that it's -- we're counting on the same good balance between volume mix and pricing to continue into next year. We will see how the things play out. But at the moment, we are planning for something similar to this year. As we said, we have means of playing around with promotional spending, and that allows us to play around with how much we will get from volume. So I wouldn't expect that it's going to be a huge change for next year. At this stage, we feel pretty confident that the current formula, and it's working for us, that we can extend it into 2019.","Robert Dickerson","Okay, fair. And then just housekeeping items, and that's all I have, is, from the Investor Day, I believe you had said the expectation was, essentially into next year, favorable trends in terms of GDP improvements, which would drive, let's call it, that 3% category growth. It seems like snacking may be -- all-in may be driven more by biscuits, and Q3 came in a bit. It sounds like the category growth is a bit below what the strat plan showed, as you said. So I guess the first question is, is there anything that really kind of changed in terms of biscuit growth trajectory into '19? And is that partially driven off of different GDP expectations? And then just secondly and simplistically, it looked like the currency effect for next year that you had mentioned at your Investor Day was the same that you put out today. But it did seem like the currency complex changed a bit over the past two months. So I'm just curious if there were any go-forward currency shifts relative to two months ago for '19. That's it.","Luca Zaramella","Yes, let me start maybe with the forex impact. The forex impact is the same as we had for Investor Day, but it happened to be a coincidence. There were various puts and takes. And I can tell you that, in general, with the profit component of emerging markets, EPS was improved. But we had the eurozone that lost a bit. So it happens to be the same. It was refreshed as of last week. So the number is the same, but it is a coincidence. In terms of categories, look, I think the guidance we gave you in terms of top line for next year, which is 2% to 2.3%, calls for a category dynamic that is in line with what we have seen this year and in line, certainly, with the 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. There might be puts and takes, but that is where we see the category, the snacking category, playing out for us this year and next year.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. So in closing, I'm proud of the work of our teams across the business and the results that we are currently seeing. We are very encouraged by the progress in our emerging markets, which were particularly strong this quarter, and of course, where we see the significant amount of our future growth to be derived. Europe remains a solid business for us. And there is work to do in North America, but I'm also confident in the opportunity for that business to start growing.","I would say that our new long-term strategy is generating excitement in our business. We are building from a position of leadership in our markets, and we are taking steps to further strengthen our capabilities and capture opportunity, as we explained. I'm here thinking particularly of the change in our commercial model, which is more consumer-focused and will drive greater local accountability. I'm also excited about the test, learn and scale approach that we are taking in innovation and then our increased focus on M&A, and that is a good example of what is more to come. And we also mentioned that we are planting the seeds for future growth with the launch of our new SnackFutures platform, of which we will inform you more in the coming weeks. And there is -- overall, incentive structure is changing. So we feel good about this quarter and then good about the coming quarters and next year. So I look forward to sharing more of our progress with you in the quarters to come, and thank you for your interest in the company.","Operator","This concludes today's call.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations from Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.","Shep Dunlap","Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO and Luca Zaramella, our CFO.

We will close with Q&A.","And with that, I will now turn the call over to Dirk.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you, Shep and good afternoon. Last September at our Investor Day, I shared with you our long-term strategy to refocus the company on sustainable top line growth, which we saw as a natural evolution from our more cost and margin-oriented strategy over the last 5 years. This new strategy leverages our unique difference from other food companies, which is our strong global presence, our iconic brands and our leaner supply model. But above all, what really sets us apart in today\u2019s difficult food environment is our unique position as a global snacking leader. Because we are in snacking, we are not in general food, we are also all over the world, not just in North America and we have global and local brands that have unique place in consumer\u2019s mind.","As such, we are a truly global company, operating in attractive, large and growing markets. And in those markets we have a strong manufacturing distribution and marketing network. This means, for instance, that our scale and strong presence in emerging markets is an asset and a competitive advantage. As an example, in the fourth quarter, our emerging markets grew at 6.5% and around 6% for the full year. More than 40% of this was volume mix driven indicating that consumers around the world consume more on-the-go snacks and treats. We connect with consumers in those markets through a portfolio of powerful global brands as well as local items. And in each market we also strive to be the industry leader in understanding consumers to advance insights and analytical capabilities. During the last 5 years, we have gone through a significant restructuring and a cost focused approach, which has created a solid foundation for investment. These strengths of our company are amplified through our unique group of people who have an incredible capability to really make a difference when they put their minds to it. Witness to that has been our margin improvement over the last 5 years.","2018 was my first full year as CEO. I joined in November 2017 and today, I feel good about what we have achieved in that short-term. In the first half of 2018, we developed a new strategy that we think will make a difference. In the second half, we started to execute against that strategy and that has translated into good results and momentum going into 2019. So, we are pretty excited about our future. This new strategy creates more growth by focusing on three pillars. First, is a new more consumer-centric marketing and sales; second, an obsession with operational excellence to optimize our demand fulfillment, but also to drive efficiency and lower our costs; and third, there is a step change in our corporate culture from short-term cost focus to a purpose-driven long-term growth focus. The combination of these three levels of growth creation will lead to what is an attractive long-term financial algorithm, 3% plus organic net revenue growth, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, dividend growth that exceeds adjusted EPS growth and over $3 billion of yearly free cash flow.","Now, in switching to the highlights of the year, I would characterize 2018 as a strong year for Mondelez. We met or exceeded our financial and strategic commitments. We accelerated our top line growth with a good balance between volume mix and price. Our execution in emerging markets drove 6% growth. Our local brands are showing improvements as we balance investment with our global brands. We expanded adjusted gross profit dollars in Q4 by approximately 5% on a constant currency basis. This was due to solid productivity, volume leverage and a good balance of pricing net of costs. We also delivered another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, which brings our 5-year average to 18% per year. Our focus on turning profit into cash flow and returning capital to shareholders also paid off. 2018 was a year of strong free cash flow, generating $2.9 billion of cash and returning more than $3 billion to investors. We continued our commitment to our impact strategy and announced all our packaging will be recyclable by 2025. I believe this strong 2018 financial performance is just a first indication of what is the potential of this company.","Now, maybe a few words on our progress against that new strategy I was talking about before. As 2018 came to a strong close, I am pleased to see that many of the elements of our new approach are being put in place. So, let me take you may be through a few highlights. 2019 will be the first full year of increased investment in our growth agenda. But as we saw good momentum as Q4 progressed, we made additional investments in A&C and go-to-market. To give you a few examples, we put incremental A&C behind areas like chocolate in India, which grew double-digits, biscuits in China, where we saw mid single-digit growth, chocolate and biscuits in Russia, which increased double-digit for the year, biscuits and chocolates in Germany with low single-digit overall country growth for the year, or chocolates in the UK, which posted low single-digit growth. Oreo in the U.S. which posted high single-digit increase for the year or we invested in our recent Mexico Oreo chocolate launch which has received very positive feedback from our customers.","We have also further invested in our research, development and quality capabilities. In Q4, we opened a new R&D technical center in India to drive innovation in chocolate and beverages. And we also expanded our state-of-the-art facility in Wroclaw, Poland with further investment in gum and candy research capabilities. The creation of the SnackFutures innovation hub will help us explore future trends and opportunities. We are also pleased with our recent acquisition of the Tate\u2019s Premium Cookies business, which delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth.","As a second big step in accelerating our consumer-centric growth, we launched our new marketing playbook, which drives shifts in several areas of our commercial approach. While in the past we focused mostly on our global brands in our new strategy we are achieving a better balance between investment in global brands like Oreo, Milka and belVita and local jewels like Fontaneda in Spain or LU in France; Freia, Marabou in the Nordics; Kinh Do in Vietnam. The combination of those two is generating stronger growth than focus on global brands alone. All combined, our brands drove overall organic net revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter.","In our second strategic pillar, which is all about driving operational excellence, we also started to show good progress, particularly as it relates to excellence in our sales channels. To give you some recent examples, we have launched initiatives to drive e-commerce excellence with key partners in China, where online sales were up strong double-digits and overall growth in China was mid single-digits. In India, we are making significant enhancements to our sales and route to market excellence, where we also grew double-digits. We are making similar shifts to tap into the significant opportunities in other emerging markets such as Africa, Southeast Asia, Russia and Mexico where our investments are accelerating growth.","As you know, in recent quarters we have put particular focus on our North American supply chain performance, where we are aiming to significantly improve its operational excellence. Q4 was a good quarter where our gradual improvement continued in the right direction. An important enabler of our future growth is our third pillar of building a winning growth culture. At the start of 2019, we implemented a new more locally oriented commercial structure with 13 business units within our existing regional framework. This shift reduces our complexity, improves our speed and encourages more entrepreneurial approaches to marketing, sales and product development. We are encouraging our colleagues to test, learn and scale, which means we are implementing a faster, more cost effective and locally driven approach to innovation.","We are also changing our incentive structure to drive better overall alignment with our key financial metrics of volume and revenue growth, gross profit progression and solid translation into earnings and cash flow. There is also a stronger direct link to local performance versus overall global performance. And another important change here is that we are refocusing the organization on volume and absolute profit dollar growth. We are also making sure that the quality of the financial results is taken into account into our incentives.","To further enhance this new consumer-oriented but also performance-based culture, we launched the new purpose of the company, empower people to snack right. We believe this will lead to higher engagement as well as new ideas on how we will fulfill our vision of being the best and biggest snacking company. One of the expressions of our new purpose is to make sure we offer the consumer the right snack made the right way. For example, in this quarter, we added Brazil to the Cocoa Life program, which is our signature sustainability approach in chocolates. And we also announced the commitment to make all our packaging around the world recyclable by 2025.","So in summary, I find that 2018 was the strong year for us, which has created good momentum in the business as we head into 2019. We are building on this momentum by increasing our investment behind key initiatives. This includes continuing to invest in our brands and portfolio to capture opportunities in broader snacking as well as driving further growth through innovation. We are also focusing our investment in higher growth geographies and under-indexed channels. We will amplify this growth by continuing to work on improving execution across our business. And I am also very excited by the energy that our new growth-focused culture is creating across the organization. Our tangible progress and the proof points I see around the world of how we are accelerating sustainable growth, underscore my belief and confidence that we are in the right segment with the right footprint and the right portfolio. Snacking is an attractive and growing global trend and we are well-positioned to continue to lead the industry.","Let me now turn to Luca for more detail on our Q4 and full year performance.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Dirk and good afternoon. It was a good quarter and a good year as we delivered on all our key financial metrics for both periods, especially as it relates to organic top line growth, earnings growth and free cash flow generation. We are also pleased with the quality of the delivery throughout the year. We had generated broad-based growth with a good balance of volume and pricing. Gross profit on a constant currency basis grew more than revenue in both Q4 and the full year. In Q4, we also started accelerating some investments to further support our brands. So, we feel good about the momentum we had coming into 2019 as our teams executed well and made progress towards our strategic roadmap.","Net revenue increased 2.4% for the full year and 2.5% for the fourth quarter. Our strong emerging market footprint propelled our growth for the year delivering an increase of nearly 6% with clear trends in Russia, India, China, Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa. In fact, Brazil was the only notable emerging market where results were soft. Excluding Argentina, emerging markets grew 4.5%. On a regional basis and for the full year, Europe continues to execute well as it delivered net revenue growth of 2.5%. Consistent with recent years, this growth was volume-driven and broad-based with solid increases across biscuits, chocolate and candy. Russia posted double-digit revenue growth behind share gains in both biscuits and chocolates, while Germany delivered another solid year of growth.","Our chocobakery business continues to demonstrate the power of test and learn innovation and excellent execution turning in high single-digit growth for the year and approaching $600 million in annual sales. We are pleased with our capabilities in this region and encouraged regarding the opportunity that remain in front of us. AMEA grew 3.5% and is accelerating with strength coming from several key markets. India delivered double-digit growth powered by great execution, robust market dynamics, share gains and innovation in chocolate and biscuit. China posted its sixth consecutive quarter of growth, increasing mid single-digits behind continued momentum and share gains in biscuits and gum. Southeast Asia also turned in robust growth propelled by demand for biscuit and chocolate, including a strong mooncake season in Q4.","We are also pleased with the progress we are making in Africa. Latin America grew 3.6%, impacted by inflation-driven growth in Argentina. However, we delivered another good year in Mexico, posting mid single-digit growth as our gum and candy business executed well. We also delivered growth in the Western Andean cluster. Brazil declined low single-digits primarily due to competitive dynamics in our powdered beverage business. Earlier in the year, the business was also impacted by a national strike. However, we delivered positive results in our Brazilian biscuits business, which grew mid single-digits behind strengths in Club Social and Oreo and although down for the year the chocolate business finished on a positive note, with low-single digit growth in Q4 and share gains. North America grew approximately 0.5% for the year. U.S. biscuits continued to see good momentum with low single-digit growth and share gains driven by brands like Oreo. We are proud that the team delivered material progress for the quarter. That said there is still work to be done to drive improved levels of consistency and we continue to expect progress in 2019 albeit not linear.","Now, let\u2019s review our profit performance. In 2018, gross profit dollars grew by approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and ahead of revenue. Gains were driven by continued productivity, volume leverage and pricing. We look to build on this progress over the long-term. Gross profit growth partially offset by additional investment drove adjusted operating income dollar expansion of more than 6% on a constant currency basis. This translated into operating income margin of 16.7%, up 60 basis points. In Q4, consistent with our long-term strategy, we invested additional dollars in growth initiatives, including point of sales and holiday season activations in Europe and Asia, A&C investments in Europe and Mexico chocolate and investments in China and Russia biscuit to sustain and accelerate momentum. Additionally, we spent in some R&D and marketing areas. On a regional basis, gross margin expansion and cost execution drove margin improvement. Europe grew 60 basis points to 19.6%. North America was flat at 20.3% as higher conversion costs in U.S. factories and customer service and logistics cost limited expansion. Latin America increased by 90 basis points to 16.4% and AMEA improved by 140 basis points to 14.4%.","I will now briefly cover category highlights. Our three snacking categories continue to demonstrate solid growth as they have all year growing at 2.7%. This is the strongest they have been in 3 years and we remain encouraged by the underlying trends and untapped opportunities. Overall, we held or gained share in 60% of our business. Year-to-date, biscuits grew 2.8%. Approximately, 80% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including our U.S., France, China, Germany and Russia businesses. In chocolate, our business grew 3.5%. Approximately, 40% of our revenue grew or held share, including Germany, Russia, China and India. The percent of businesses growing or holding shares was 50% in Q4 and it is further improving in the latest period. Gum and candy growth was slightly positive, reflecting modestly improved results in developed markets. About 40% of our revenue in this business gained or held share, including strength in China gum and solid U.S. candy performance.","Now, turning to earnings per share, as is mentioned, 2018 was another year of strong adjusted EPS growth, increasing 15% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven primarily by strong operating gains, share repurchases, taxes, with our JV investments also performing well.","I will now move on to our free cash flow results. For the year, we executed with excellence and delivered $2.9 billion of free cash flow, which was consistent with our outlook and a great outcome despite currency headwinds. This performance was driven by better net income conversion due to strong working capital management. As I mentioned at our Investor Day, this is a critical focus area for me, my team and the entire company. Turning to capital return, 2018 also marked another year of significant return of capital to our shareholders. We returned $3.4 billion in total as we repurchased $2 billion in stock and paid $1.4 billion in dividends. This includes an 18% increase to our cash dividends in Q3 as we continue to target dividend growth in excess of earnings.","Now, let me provide some details around our outlook for 2019, which remains consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day last fall. I would like to remind you that this is an important year of investment as we continue to focus on accelerating volume-driven revenue growth for the long-term. For the top line, we expect organic net revenue growth of 2% to 3%. With respect to earnings, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 3% to 5%, which reflects a step up in investment levels in A&C, sales, R&D and quality. These investments will reinforce a growth cycle, which we expect to lead to a high single-digit earnings growth over the long-term.","Our outlook for the free cash flow is approximately $2.8 billion consistent with our results in 2018. Recall, this outlook includes additional cash tax impact resulting from U.S. tax reform. In this outlook, we also expect our 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low 20s and expect interest expense to be approximately $450 million, reflecting the increasing rate environment. 2019 is an important year for Mondelez International. It will mark the first full year of our new approach to investing behind our strategic growth initiatives. Our new approach will set the stage for our long-term growth algorithm of 3% plus organic net revenue growth with a ramp up in the outer years. High single-digit adjusted EPS, dividends greater than adjusted earnings and free cash flow of more than $3 billion.","With that, let\u2019s open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Good afternoon, everybody.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Andrew.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi, two questions from me if I could. I will start with, Dirk, you have been in the CEO seat for just over a year now and recently detailed the company\u2019s strategy and growth algorithm along with a new organizational structure to support it. I am trying to get a sense of how you are feeling about the company\u2019s momentum heading into this year? And I ask with particular interest in terms of organic sales trends because you have got incremental pricing that you have announced, incremental investments that we saw in both 4Q and then expect it again throughout this year. I guess if anything it would seem like the organic sales growth target for this year perhaps could end up as a bit conservative. And I wanted to get your perspective on that? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay, okay. So well, I would say a few reflections on how I feel after about a year and 3 months in the job. Probably the most important for me was to deliver 2018 and I think we over delivered on what we said we would do. And the quality I think was good. If I think about it, we accelerated our net revenue growth, which was volume-driven and you said that, we also had some good price discipline. We continued to focus on our cost and so we had good gross profit growth and ROI and EPS growth was solid as well as the free cash flow generation. And on top, we were able to start reinvesting in Q4 to sustain the accelerated growth. So I feel good about all that. Second, as you pointed out, we developed our new strategy and financial algorithm for the company, which creates growth on the three levels where more demand creation to a new approach to sales and marketing, more demand fulfillment through better execution and then new ideas and innovation through a different mindset or a different culture in the company. There is a number of big shifts in the company. One is about the balance between top and bottom line, not just focused on the bottom line. Dollars over percentage focus, speed over perfection and a stronger focus on volume and market share and it\u2019s giving us momentum as you said. And so that confirms my observation that we have good potential, because snacking categories are doing well, they have been probably the best in the last 3 years in \u201818. We have got good margin expansion and we have good competitive levels that allow us to unlock investment and shift our focus to volume growth and we can generate substantial free cash flow. So yes, of course, that makes you think you are stronger than you were a few years back. Why are you guiding towards the 2%, 3% top line growth? And yes, we have momentum in emerging markets and if I think about 2018 and the mix of the pluses and the minuses that we had, overall, we probably had a few more pluses, as you remember, the main driver of it was that we are lapping the malware year of 2017 so 2019 is a year that we need to even if we guide toward that 2%, 3%, we need to step up our growth and we need to solidify our progress if I would look at today and reflect about 2019, probably the mix of risks and opportunities raise it a little bit more toward risk I\u2019m talking largely the macroeconomics, Brexit, some of the commodity things we are seeing and so, we also are stepping up and we are probably will point that out our investments we are doing it largely so that 2020 will be the year that we are starting to see some good growth so, we feel that 2019 outlook is appropriate but we are clearly entering the year with a bit of good momentum.","Andrew Lazar","Great I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good evening.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi I had a question for you have had a pretty strong sustainable growth in your categories over the past few years and including in 2018 it seems like that category growth rates continue and I think it was up 2.7% for your snacking categories. Is that what you would expect for 2019 as well?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, yes, that\u2019s in our long-term strategic plan we estimated that we will be circling around the 3% growth, and we are at this stage, we will not see that 2.7% has been sort of consistent throughout 2018, what we were saying, and we are not seeing an immediate change for that and going into 2019 so yes, we reconfirm that.","Chris Growe","Okay. And then as you look at your margin performance in 2019, I know there is a much more-heavier focus on reinvestment and accelerating revenue growth so you have cost savings coming through from simplified to grow and then I suspect you\u2019re going to have some more, is it mostly SG&A investments so could we see a stronger gross margin performance? And then maybe some of that given back, if you will, in the form of SG&A investments when it comes to A&C and route-to-market that kind of thing is that the way to think about the investment levels in 2019?","Luca Zaramella","So, Chris, I think, look, as we said many times, we are trying to create a little bit of a cultural shift in the company and moving away from simple percentages the clear commitment we have is to drive gross profit growth and OI growth and EPS growth and as you think about that in the past by guiding to gross margin percentages and OI percentages, we left on the table we believe some opportunities we gave you in the past a couple of examples namely around channels and incrementality we see there, or for that matter, also local brands I think we have what it takes to generate incrementality there and to deliver good return on investment make no mistake when we say that we are focusing on dollar growth it doesn\u2019t mean that we will live outside productivity or the restructuring program that we announced in at the Investor Day the continuation of the current program, or for that matter, things that we have done quite well like ZBB and MBS over the last few years so, I think, as you think about the quality of the P&L in 2019, if you take out the additional investments we have, that are, as we said, in A&C but also in route-to-market or in quality or in R&D and marketing I think if you take those out, the shape and the quality of the P&L is very consistent with what we did in 2018.","Chris Growe","Okay that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good afternoon, everyone.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Bryan.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Just I guess, just two questions for me one, just in the fourth quarter the margins in North America were pretty good and, I guess, I just wanted to understand, since there it sounds like there were some reinvestment there was there anything else there that was sort of unusual or flowed through in North America, I guess, or was it just the pricing, the PNOC that helped? I\u2019m just trying to understand the margin performance in North America in the fourth quarter.","Luca Zaramella","The margin was good as you say in North America I think as you think about it, we did make improvements in reliability of the supply chain and the logistics network and I think as we stabilize the situation a bit in terms of service levels, we were able to deliver efficiencies that in the other part of the year we were not I think you also saw that there was a little bit of a pricing favorability above and beyond the average of the year there were some phasing, quite frankly in there so I think as you think about pricing it was roundabout the number you have to keep in mind is the number that you see for the year, which was roundabout 1% but I think in stepping back and looking into it, quite pleased in North America with the continued momentum we\u2019ve seen in biscuit, still some challenges in categories like gum but in general, the margin that came through in Q4 was a good news for us and that\u2019s something to the team that did a nice job by stabilizing the situation in supply chain.","Bryan Spillane","And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that as we\u2019re thinking about if service levels are improving in North America and hopefully continue to improve some in 2019 are you going to be able to how are you thinking about the balance between investing and spending in North America and then actually being able to service the programs? Do you feel like you\u2019ve you\u2019re maybe not spending as much or doing as much as you might ordinarily want to if you had full confidence in the ability to service it?","Luca Zaramella","The outlook we have in place at the moment, it clearly has investments in North America now, having said that, there are still things that we need to look into, as we said in the last call, we implemented pricing and we are about see the effect in the marketplace so we need to stay flexible there and see how to best balance investments with pricing we also want to be clear that while we believe we are making good progress and we\u2019ve seen growth coming through, there is still work to be done in North America so in general terms I would say, we will invest more behind categories like biscuits or categories like candy, even in gum but the reality is we need to take an inventory of where we stand at the end of Q1 in terms of pricing and supply chain and then I think we need to adjust is the case.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. I will leave it there. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Hi thank you very much.","Dirk Van de Put","Good morning, Ken.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Hi, guys. The primary pushback again on your stock is valuation and specifically on EBITDA and I think I talked to investors, many of them understand that the value of your joint ventures needs to be added back but plenty at least not at first glance seem to get that so, to me this issue is increasing, right? Investors are weighing EBITDA more heavily because debt levels have risen higher so, I guess, my question is this, if your thesis is correct that investors are sort of, I guess, punishing companies like Mondelez for relying on unconsolidated operations, does that you does that make you, I guess, internally rethink the value of your joint ventures to your stock price, or is that not really a way for you to factor that?","Luca Zaramella","Look, I think we can clearly debate if we are overvalued or undervalued, I believe when I step back and I look at the opportunities we have as a company and the quality of the results that we delivered in 2018, I feel quite good about the long-term guidance that we gave and as a leading snacking company, ability to generate sustainably volume-driven growth of and resulting in revenue of 3%, high-single digit EPS and cash flow of $3 billion plus, I think it is something that is quite compelling my reply to your specific question is, look, the JVs clearly don\u2019t roll-up into our EBITDA they are around about 10% of our EPS I believe that clearly it was a great investment I believe there is still upside potential so I think they are still undervalued but the premise of Mondelez I think tangibly looking back at 2018 and handing us delivering in face of all the ForEx [indiscernible] that we had, a cash flow that was $2.9 billion with a conversion of net income that was excluding the JVs for which we don\u2019t get much dividend, 130%, I think that should reassure investors that we have what it takes to win and again, the premise of us being in emerging markets, seeing emerging markets growing 6% for the year, more than 6% for Q4, 40% of that growth being volume-driven. I mean, I can tell you we are quite pleased. And I think as you think about the valuation, think about what our potential is as a leading snacking company in emerging markets or for that matter, globally so that will be my reply.","Ken Goldman","Okay thank you for that. And then a quick follow-up, at the end of your prepared remarks you reiterated your desire to grow dividends ahead of EPS growth can you elaborate on why this is the right decision? It feels to me, we just talked about, I think, investors are increasingly sensitive to debt your company that\u2019s also increasingly emphasizing growth and that requires reinvestment it just may be feels to me like raising your dividend above earnings isn\u2019t the ideal strategy but I\u2019m just curious to hear the rationale behind the take there.","Luca Zaramella","I think it is the confidence we have in the overall capital structure of the company if you step back and if you think about the ability we have to generate free cash flow and our commitment that materialized in 2018 of $3 billion-plus from 2020 on, if you think about the balance sheet flexibility we have at our current leverage, but also with the fact that we were fairly clear, the coffee stake is an investment for us and it is not strategic that gives us flexibility so if you put the ability we have to generate cash, if you take into account the leverage that we have today, the coffee stake that we have, even in premise of M&A, I think we have what it takes to be able to have the flexibility to do share buybacks, to get dividend, and also to make M&A so I think you can update one piece you have to look at all of this together and all the elements are there pointing in the direction that there is confidence in being able to raise dividends the last time we did it, it was 18% so we feel good about that.","Ken Goldman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Good afternoon, everyone.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi. So just a quick question the emerging market growth ex-Argentina being in the 4% to 5%, two things a little lackluster I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of that was Brazilian gum and what\u2019s the prognosis there? It sounds as though Brazil was down low-single digits and some of the categories were positive, but gum business must have been in quite some trouble so maybe some commentary there and then just as a follow-up, some of the household products companies have complained local competition in places like China have slowed them down quite a bit what are you seeing out there in China relative to your local competitors? Do you think that\u2019s relevant to you and is that something that you\u2019re worried about in terms of getting the emerging markets growing again? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Well, on Brazil, yes, Brazil was, of the emerging markets, probably the one that didn\u2019t perform as we would have hoped in 2018 but we feel that over the medium-term, the growth prospects for Brazil are quite good it wasn\u2019t really because of gum that 2018 was more difficult for us it was really driven by two things there was a bit of a price scuffle, I would say, in the chocolate category, which we are getting through we see at the moment we see good volume growth in chocolate in Brazil we addressed the price gaps, and we started to gain share in the last quarter in biscuits, we were largely flat as it relates to share so it was really on top of the chocolate issue, it was the Powdered Beverages, which in Brazil we are seeing a colder summer so a slowdown in Q4 and we are expecting the same in Q1 of our Powdered Beverages sales and then on top, overall the Powdered Beverage category is doing a little bit less than cold drinks in general and then us within that category losing some market share so that was the real driver for Brazil as it relates to China, we obviously, like everybody else, have the local competition but we are pretty happy with our performance in China we had another solid quarter, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for us in China all of our categories are growing. In gum, we are increasing our market share quite considerably because we launched a new product called Stride Waves, which is the same as the Trident Vibes here in the U.S. and then in chocolate, we launched our Milka Magic Cup and there also we have about 0.5 point of market share gains and then in biscuits, where we have the most local competition, we have been really doing well, with more than 1 point gain of our market share combined between online\/offline we have got some pretty heavy growth going on in our e-commerce business in China, which is up almost 80% for the year so, overall, yes, there is a competition but at this stage, we feel like we are doing quite well in China.","Alexia Howard","Great, thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi, two quick questions. You mentioned A&C investments in the quarter I don\u2019t know if I heard you quantify how much A&C was up year-over-year. Can you give us a sense of what it was in the quarter and then the year ago I am sorry for the overall year how much of it was up? And then secondly, pricing down a lot in Europe, my impression is that, especially in the UK that a lot of pricing needs to go higher to offset higher input costs and then, of course, the Brexit situation might make that accentuate that do you have a contingency plan if there is a hard Brexit this year? Thanks.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Robert. So, maybe Dirk will take the Brexit. I will start by commenting a bit on your A&C question and pricing as we said, we activated more investments in Q4, but we are not going to quantify by the way, it was A&C and as we saw good momentum in India chocolate, in China biscuits and gum, in Russia chocolate and biscuits, we gained in Russia alone more than 2 points of share in the last 12 months so as we saw these economies doing very well, as we saw volume-driven growth, I think we put more A&C and I think it was the right decision as we said, we are trying to invest in our local brands as well, but it was not only A&C I think if you look at what we did in Q4, for instance, we spent in seasonal activation in big countries like the UK, Germany and, for instance, in India, in Australia. But we also spent in route-to-market and finally we had investments in marketing and R&D I think if you think about the quantum, it was clearly materializing so the quality of the earnings, we had gross margin growing 90 basis points for the quarter, off of it dropped to the bottom line so we reinvested quite a bit going forward, we will reinvest even more the difference is going to be that it will involve more countries and more brands as to pricing, I wouldn\u2019t get quite frankly where it\u2019s fixated on the Q4 pricing impact for Europe there were some phasing in there what I can tell you is that, in general, the total pricing for the company was in the right place Europe specifically was able to generate nice gross profit growth, so gross margin was up in Europe again so it was puts and takes between pricing and commodities at ForEx that we had effectively covered for Europe I don\u2019t think there is much to worry at this point in time on pricing in Europe with the exception of may be Brexit that Dirk is going to talk about in a minute.","Dirk Van de Put","So, as it relates to Brexit, yes, I mean, the UK is an important business for us and we have a very good team there that\u2019s very solid and I think they\u2019re very well-equipped to weather through this situation we don\u2019t know and that\u2019s the difficulty of Brexit we don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going to happen here so we have to really prepare for the worst and hope for the best and the worst is clearly a hard Brexit we are assessing all the potential scenarios, and we do feel that Brexit will, for sure, have a short-term and a medium-term impact over the long-term, we believe that it will stabilize itself and we will come back to where we are today and, obviously, there\u2019s a huge difference between a hard Brexit and a softer Brexit so, as it relates to the hard Brexit, our contingency plan is quite extensive and it basically is focused on the disruption and the ease of the flow of the goods so we\u2019ve invested in additional resources in logistics operations that means, we\u2019ve rented many more trucks. We have rented much more warehousing space. We\u2019ve increased our inventories. We are making sure that we are capable even in difficult circumstances to maintain our customer service. And we are very focused on demand planning. And so, we\u2019ve also increased, for instance, our additional raw and packaging materials in the UK and in Europe. Now, Brexit, Brexit could come with other effects like devaluations or tariffs, may be a loss of consumer confidence in the first part. Those types of things we have not included in our current guidance. But we are preparing for it in case it would happen. I hope that yesterday\u2019s vote helps a little bit to avoid the hard Brexit. And then as it relates to pricing, I think we will have to see what happens particularly with Brexit itself to make decisions. At the moment, our pricing is adapted to the current situation, but we are ready to adapt the pricing as Brexit would start to happen.","Robert Moskow","Okay. Thank you very much.","Luca Zaramella","Okay.","Dirk Van de Put","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hi, good evening, folks.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Jason.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Jason English","Thanks for sliding me in. I appreciate that you\u2019re focused on the holistic portfolio now and don\u2019t want to spend time dwelling on the legacy sort of Power Brands versus non-Power Brands. But I\u2019m going to try anyways, because the strategy clearly is one of trying to activate the periphery of the portfolio. And I love to get a bit more context of how it\u2019s working so far. So, is there any sort of performance metric you can give us and how these non-Power Brands are progressing as you extend the investment?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. We can explain that a little bit. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the periphery of the portfolio. The \u2013 our non-Power Brands or our non-global brands are sometimes quite important. And we\u2019re really using them in synergy to try to cover as many aspects of the consumer needs that exist. And so, for instance, in Russia, we become leaders in chocolate by using the combination of Alpen Gold and Milka to be the winners in the market. So, it\u2019s more than the periphery. It\u2019s really playing off brands against each other and making sure that we activate all of those brands. So that is still, of course, a work-in-progress. But I would say that we have seen the Power Brands continuing largely on their trend of about 3% growth. And then we\u2019ve seen the local brands go down \u2013 go up, sorry, from a negative growth in the past two \u2013close to 1% growth in the last quarter. That sort of the shift we\u2019re seeing and obviously that\u2019s only after about 4 months of activation of those local brands. So, we\u2019re expecting to see more growth in 2019.","Jason English","Excellent. Thank you for sharing that. And I want to come back to a comment you made in the prepared remarks about empowering people to snack right. I guess, snack right means lots of things to lots of people, but to me it seems to connote a degree of health and wellness, which is not something I think comes top of mind when we think about your portfolio. So, can you talk about the context around that statement in terms of your vision and whether or not it does entail a bigger push in health and wellness? And if so, how much of this would be sort of strategic M&A and priority versus organic?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. It means many things. It does have a health and wellness connotation. But if I take it up one step, it is a recognition that the same consumer depending on the moment of the day and the situation in which she finds \u2013 he or she finds himself can make different decisions. And when we say right, we mean that we want to offer the right product for the right occasion. And we see \u2013 as we look around at what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s growing in percentage it\u2019s the more health and wellness-oriented categories, but in dollars it\u2019s still the old biscuits, chocolate, ice cream and categories like that, that are getting the biggest growth. As it relates to health and wellness, yes, we clearly have an intent to do several things. It probably starts with constantly trying to improve the ingredients on our product, the sourcing of our raw materials, and may be that\u2019s not necessarily health-related, but we\u2019re thinking about Cocoa Life or our Harmony Wheat programs that we have, which are about more sustainability of the raw materials and so on. But I think that\u2019s also these days something that the consumer appreciates as we do that in our brands. We will also eliminate as much as we can fat and salt and things like that. And yes, we will need to have more pure health-oriented brands. We have several, belVita would be the one that comes most to mind, but we have clearly an intent apart from continuing to improve our current brands to launch more health-oriented options under our current brands or to launch new brands or \u2013 and you\u2019re right that might has to be partially also through M&A. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s more biased in one or another direction. It\u2019s a little bit of a whole spectrum of activity that we have in mind.","Jason English","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good evening, and I hope everyone in Chicago staying warm.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, in the office, we are okay.","Steven Strycula","But I think Shep was handing out handwarmers or something like that around the order of table. But \u2013 so my question is for Dirk to kick it off would be, how do I think about some of the more impactful investments in A&C and just in your broader route-to-market you\u2019re making this year. Specifically, Dirk, what are the key markets where sales force headcount for Mondelez employee is increasing, and then which emerging markets would local iconic brands matter most in your opinion? Then I have a short follow-up for Luca.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. Well, I would say, where the manpower matters is largely in the emerging markets, the reason being that a lot of the sales are still happening to mom-and-pop and smaller stores, which you have to physically cover. And so, the countries that come to mind to be able to do that are, of course, India, but even Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, those are the markets where we are planning to invest. Overall, in how we cover the stores and get a bigger universe of coverage, it\u2019s not only people. It\u2019s also driven by the equipment that we might need, trucks or in-store display equipment, in the hotter climates for our chocolate business we need coolers. So that\u2019s really what for us is \u2013 what we mean when we say we are going to invest in route-to-market. And I think I took you through the markets that we are going to do that. As it relates to the significant emerging markets for us, while we\u2019re seeing at the moment, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in India, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in Russia. We talked about Brazil, that wasn\u2019t \u2013 \u201818 wasn\u2019t a great year, but that\u2019s a key market for us. We are also \u2013 China, of course, we need to the look at the opportunity we have for mid-single digit that we would like to increase that. And then the markets where I would say, our presence \u2013 all those markets I\u2019ve talked about there\u2019s probably close to a $1 billion for us more or less give or take. Southeast Asia, there\u2019s still a few markets there where our presence is not as big as it should be, our market share is not as big as it should be. So, we are also planning to do quite some investments in there.","Steven Strycula","Okay, great. And then, Luca, since you\u2019re trying to direct our attention to focus more on profit dollar growth as an industry, how should we think \u2013 or as a company, how should we think about for \u201819 EBIT dollar trends on a constant currency basis, constant currency headwind?","Luca Zaramella","Yes. Look, we \u2013 again, I think if you look at the guidance we gave in terms of EPS, 3% to 5%, we guided on interest cost at $450 million. I can \u2013 you can walk it back up and see that it is, I guess, roundabout the same EPS growth that you have. There are puts and takes obviously, but that\u2019s what it is.","Steven Strycula","Alright. Thank you. Congrats on the good quarter.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you, and good evening.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, David.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, David.","David Driscoll","Hi, two small modeling questions and then just one bigger question. What\u2019s your inflation forecast for 2019? And then on the organic revenue forecast of 2% to 3%, would it be correct to assume that, that would skew towards pricing as opposed to vol\/mix? And then I have a follow-up, please.","Luca Zaramella","Look, on the inflation, we are not going to break that out in terms of composition of cost inflation, ForEx inflation, commodity. I think as you model, think about commodities being pretty much in line with what we have seen this year in terms of inflation. There is clearly logistics cost that is creating a little bit of a pressure point. That was one of the key drivers that drove us increasing pricing in North America for 2019. But we also see some packaging and the ForEx to a certain extent is one of the components that is creating a little bit of pressure in terms of inflation. And again, we are taking action obviously. Clearly, we are covering our exchange rate exposure throughout the year. And we had good coverage at this point, I think we took advantage of some of the dips that we saw recently, for instance, for the Brazilian reais. On the composition of the 2% to 3%, I prefer not to go there. We are not going to give guidance on that specifically. Clearly, as you think about what we said in the context of Investor Day, we believe that volume growth is the right thing. And when you think about the various regions, I think we will continue seeing good momentum in terms of volume in EU, same in AMEA. LA, clearly, there is Argentina and some inflationary pressure. And in North America, we need to wait and see what happens with the price increase as it becomes effective in the marketplace. And so, I think there we have to see if the elasticity we model is the right one or if it is better or worse.","David Driscoll","And then on the investments that you\u2019re making in 2019, can you give us some color on the pacing of those investments? And then also, one clarification on your fourth quarter comment, I believe you used the phrase something like you accelerated your investments and they began in the fourth quarter. Does that mean that the dollar amount of investments in \u201819 is now less because some of it took place in the fourth quarter, or is it just in aggregate going up because you had flexibility in the fourth quarter, but again, please don\u2019t forget the pacing part of the investment question for \u201819. Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","No, I didn\u2019t forget the pacing term. So, let me answer that first. I think as you think about it, it is fairly even throughout the various quarters. Bear in mind that there are seasonal events throughout the year. So, Easter, for instance, happens to fall in 2019 a little bit but later than it did in 2018. So, it is a Q2 event and there are other seasonal events. But specifically, on A&C, it is equally phased throughout the quarter, I would say, give or take.","Dirk Van de Put","The other part was, does it mean we are going to reduce our investment in \u201819? And no, the answer is no. It\u2019s clear that our intent that the investment pace of \u201819 is we are going to increase on that in \u201820, yes, maybe not at the same pace as in \u201819, but we are trying to change our circle here to a virtuous circle. So, our objective is to keep on growing and in that way increase our top-line growth.","David Driscoll","Thank you very much.","Dirk Van de Put","No problem.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Thanks. Just a real general one on execution. You\u2019ve talked about trying to improve that execution and accountability by pushing some decision-making down to the regional level. It looks like from the outside like Europe has been executing pretty well, perhaps that will be tested by higher input prices and that requiring pricing, which is never easy there. And then conversely North America seemingly struggled far longer than it should have post-malware, especially with some of the competition pretty distracted. But it seems to be a little bit of an early stage here of getting tied together. Could you perhaps just walk us around the world over the regions as you see where the execution is today and where you see it going?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, maybe before I do that, we look at execution in more than in general execution. We are trying to split that up in several different groups, if I can. And, of course, there is the supply chain execution and that has to see with how good are we at buying our raw materials and our packs, how good are we running our plants, how well are we doing our demand planning and our deployment and so on and so on. And as you can imagine there\u2019s always areas anywhere in the world people can improve. But apart from the supply chain it also has to see with commercial execution then it goes from marketing and our ROI and our marketing activities around the world and how are we going to drive that. And can we use the latest technology to drive that as an in-store presence and that improvement of our route-to-market that we were talking about. So, it\u2019s wider than you might think. If I go around the world, I would say, in general, we have an objective in all regions of the world to clearly increase our ROI in our marketing and our sales activities. And everybody has an opportunity there. As it relates to the execution in the supply chain, you\u2019re right. In general, our supply chain in Europe is clearly performing better and a well-oiled machine and the U.S. is getting there or North America is getting there, but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. You take into account that they are still using some of our older factories to do so. As it relates to the Rest of the World, I would say, Latin America is making big strides as it relates to their supply chain and it\u2019s working very well.","And in AMEA, we are also pretty happy with where we stand, the differences between the different countries but also going quite well. But I think you cannot see this as a black and white, they are doing it well or they\u2019re not doing it well. Every single region can lift itself to the next level and that\u2019s really the challenge. If you\u2019re in a company like ours and we focus on margin and cost to just make sure that we are running our plants in a better way, we run our supply chain in a better way, get the waste out of there, bring down over time, run our lines optimally, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about here. And I can tell you that, anywhere in the world we have opportunity to improve that. It\u2019s more difficult in some areas, but the opportunity to my opinion is quite big like it would be in any other big company to my opinion.","David Palmer","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Thanks. I think that brings us to the end of today. So, in closing, I would say that 2018 was a great year for us. We had good top line growth. We had solid profitability. We improved our free cash flow. We created a steady motion, a new strategy, that I think is the right approach, and it\u2019s the right time to deliver higher quality sustainable growth for the company. And as I look at 2019 and the year ahead, I\u2019m encouraged by the health of our snacking markets and the categories in which we operate. I think our teams are energized. We are happy about what we have achieved. We are excited about the future. And I think the new structure and incentive plans we\u2019ve put in place are giving people the liberty and then the potential to really go and do and make things happen. It will be a year of investment as we pointed out. But we think it\u2019s the right thing to do because we believe we can lift this business to a higher level of growth. And that will lead to better returns for investors. So, I look forward to continuing to share our progress. I will probably see you all in CAGNY, and thank you again for your interest in the company.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondel\u0113z's management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay","Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Dave Brearton, our CFO. Earlier today, we issued two news releases; one detailing our first quarter earnings and financial improved profitability and another on our intention to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders. These releases and today's slides are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com.","As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","","Thanks Dexter and good morning. We launched Mondel\u0113z International in October 2012. We set out to create a global snacking powerhouse that will deliver top tier financial performance and be a great place to work. Since our launch we\u2019ve made good progress in many areas. We have grown our market shares fueled by investments behind our power brands and innovation platforms. We strengthened our geographic footprint and route to market capabilities. We stepped up cost reductions in both our supply chain and in overheads to drive margin expansion and we strengthened our balance sheet while significantly boosting cash returns to shareholders through both share repurchase and higher dividends.","But despite these many accomplishments we are not where we should be at this point in our journey. The recent global slowdown in our categories has tempered our near-term top-line growth as well as that of our peers\u2019. This slowdown has made it imperative that we act more quickly and more aggressively to address the inefficiencies in our cost structure.","So today we are taking too both steps, both to improve our near-term results and to increase confidence that we will deliver sustainable top tier financial performance over the long-term.","First, we\u2019re focusing our portfolio even further on snacks, by combining our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders 1753 to create the world\u2019s leading pure play coffee company. Second, we\u2019re setting up and accelerating our cost reduction efforts to deliver best in class costs in both our supply chain and in overheads.","Together, these actions will enable us to become an even more focused and nimble global snacking powerhouse; to achieve world class margins faster, to simplify how we work around the world, to speed up and clarify decision making and to generate the fuel to invest more in our people, in our brands and in our executional capabilities. All of this will help us deliver superior returns to our shareholders. I\u2019ll take the next few minutes to discuss these strategic initiatives in more detail.","Let me start with the coffee transaction. We intend to combined our nearly $4 billion coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create the world\u2019s leading pure-play coffee company. This new company will have annual revenues of more than $7 billion and an EBITDA margin in the high-teens. It will bring together our portfolios of iconic brands, our complementary geographic footprints and our innovative technologies to transform two strong businesses into an even stronger one. The combined company will feature our market leading brands like Jacobs and Tassimo and Douwe Egberts and Senseo from D.E Master Blenders.","The combined company can be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts will have an advantage position in the $81 billion global coffee category including leading market shares in more than two dozen countries and a sizable footprint in all key emerging markets. With greater focus and increased scale, the new company can operate more efficiently and invest more effectively in innovation, manufacturing and market development to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in coffee.","When we close this transaction, we\u2019ll receive after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $5 billion and a 49% interest in the combined company. Our partner, Acorn Holdings is the current owner of D.E Master Blenders and will have a 51% interest in the combined company, as well as the majority of seats on the Board.","Acorn is owned by an investor group led by [JAV] Holdings Company, an investment vehicle managed by three highly respected senior partners with whom we\u2019re delighted to team. Bart Becht, the former CEO of Reckitt Benckiser and current Chairman of D.E Master Blenders. Peter Harf, a former senior executive at InBev, Reckitt and [Cody]. And Olivier Goudet, the former CFO of Mars.","While Becht will be Chairman of the new combined company, Pierre Laubies, the current CEO of D.E Master Blenders is the perspective CEO of the new company. The other members of his leadership team will be joined from both coffee businesses using a best-of-both approach.","The deal is expected to close in the course of 2015 subject to limited closing conditions. During the interim period, both companies will undertake complications with all works counsels as required.","We are delighted with this transaction and the substantial value we expect it to create for our shareholders. By retaining a 49% stake, we will continue to benefit from the future growth of the coffee category and sharing the synergies and tremendous upside of this leading to pure-play coffee company.","We expect to use the majority of the approximately $5 billion of cash proceeds to extend our share repurchase program subject to Board approval. The balance of the cash proceeds will be used for debt reduction and for general corporate purposes. Let me assure you that while deploying the cash proceeds, we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating with assets to Tier 2 commercial paper.","In terms of our P&L, we expect the transaction to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year after closing. In addition to unlocking and creating significant value for our coffee business, this transaction will also enhance the profile and prospects of our core snacking business. Once completed, approximately 85% of our net revenue will come from snacks, up from about 75% today.","Going forward, this sharper focus will help optimize our capital allocation, including investments to drive growth of our global platforms and to expand routes to market. So, that's the first type of the news.","Now let's turn to the second type. We're taking actions today to accelerate and enhance margin expansion. Specifically, we are fast tracking our previously announced supply chain reinvention program and significantly reducing overhead costs.","As Daniel Myers explained last September, over the next three years, we expect to deliver $3 billion in gross productivity savings, $1.5 billion in net productivity and $1 billion in incremental cash. We\u2019ve already made good progress against those goals. We\u2019re on track to open our state-of-the-art biscuit facility in Mexico in the fourth quarter. We've initiated significant projects in India, China and Russia. We're expanding biscuit manufacturing in the Czech Republic and investing in new biscuit manufacturing technology in the U.S.","In addition, we've made some tough decisions to close or sell 9 plants and streamline another 21. As a result, in 2013 alone, we've reduced headcount in our supply chain by 3,000 plus another 1,000 contractors. All of these actions will enable delivery of the benefits we previously outlined. We also laid out additional opportunities through 2020 to manufacture more of our Power Brands on advantage lines of the future and to streamline our production base.","Today, we're taking steps to accelerate some of those projects. This will allow us to capture savings even sooner and result in additional margin upside through 2018. With this accelerated program, we now expect our net productivity to increase from the 2.3% we talked about in September to around 3% over the next few years.","With respect to overhead, as we discussed the CAGNY in February, we're committed to creating a leaner, simpler and more nimble organization by significantly reducing operating costs. Achieving best in class overhead costs across our business is particularly important, given the near-term slowdown in the growth of our categories especially in emerging markets.","In addition, the combination of our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders allows us to create an even simpler more focused global snacking company. To drive overhead savings, we're starting with the clean sheet of paper and employing a zero-base budgeting approach. With the help of Accenture, we used ZBB analytical tools to look objectively at our overhead costs and compare them to best in class external benchmarks.","This has enabled us to question how, where and why we spend our money. While this certainly involves addressing headcount, we're also targeting non-headcount costs. The lowest hanging fruit is to look at our policies and practices across a dozen major cost areas to identify changes that will help us to quickly reduce costs in a sustainable way. As an example, our travel costs are significantly higher than peers\u2019, that\u2019s partly because we travel more, reflecting the coordination necessary during the Cadbury and LU integrations as well as the startup of our new company. But it\u2019s also because we weren\u2019t effectively leveraging our scale with suppliers.","If you multiply that example to many other cost areas across our company it adds up pretty quickly to some big savings. To enable us to capture these savings in both our supply chain in overheads our board has approved a new $3.5 billion restructuring program through 2018 comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and $1 billion in non-cash costs. We expect to incur the majority of the restructuring charges in 2015 and 2016.","Capital expenditures in support of these programs are already included in our CapEx target of about 5% of revenues for the next few years. As a result of this program we expect to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018 with savings about equally split between supply chain and overheads.","With $1.5 billion of savings on $2.5 billion of cash costs it\u2019s clear that these project have very strong returns well in excess of our cost of capital. The cost savings from this restructuring program will enable us to accelerate and increase our future margin expansion plans. Specifically we are raising bottom end of our 2016 adjusted OI margin range so that we are now targeting 15% to 16% up from 14% to 16%. This improvement comes largely from greater overhead savings. After 2016, along with continued improvement in overheads we expect the contribution from supply chain to build. This will enable us to drive further margin expansion beyond our revised 2016 target, while continuing to fund growth.","Taking together the strategic initiatives we\u2019ve announced today underscore our determination to become a leaner, more focused and more nimble global snacking powerhouse.","Let me now turn the call over to Dave, to provide details on our first quarter results.","Dave Brearton","Thanks Irene. As you\u2019ll see in the next few slides, we\u2019re off to a solid start this year. We\u2019re making meaningful progress towards our margin goals, while continuing to deliver growth and strong market shares.","Specifically, our organic net revenue growth was 2.8% in line with the overall growth of our categories and within our 2% to 3% guidance range for the quarter. On the margin front, we delivered a big increase in adjusted operating income margin up a 140 basis points to 12.2%. And our adjusted EPS was $0.39 that\u2019s up 17% on a constant currency basis and on the higher end the double-digit guidance we gave for the year.","Looking more closely at our revenue growth, pricing was the key contributor as we began to implement price increases in all of our regions and across most of our categories to offset higher input costs. Despite, these pricing actions we were able to drive the modest increase into our mix. And while the shift of Easter was a headwind for the quarter the 40 basis points impact was lower than expected.","Coffee remained a headwind, but the pass-through of lower green coffee costs tampering our growth by 60 basis points. Emerging markets were up nearly 7% reflecting challenging conditions in a number of key countries. Our developed markets were essentially flat growing 0.2%. Overall our Power Brands continue to drive our growth increasing 4.8% in particular Cadbury, Dairy Milk, Milka, Chips Ahoy, belVita, Tuc (inaudible) and Tang were among our best performers in the quarter.","Now let\u2019s take a closer look at our results by cash grades. For the second consecutive quarter category growth was slower than historical averages with growth of only 2.8%. This was due in part to the Easter shift but also reflects continued weak demand in emerging markets and lower coffee prices. With Easter occurring three weeks later than last year some consumer demand was pushed into the second quarter, however revenue was less effective as we started shippings distribute related products in March. This can best you see in chocolate for a 2.3% growth significantly outpaced the category growth rate of 1%.","The ongoing global slowdown was the second factor that contributed to sluggish growth across the most of our categories. But good news is that our market share performance was solid with over 60% of our revenues gaining or holding share, despite the price increases mentioned earlier.","A closer look at our categories shows that our biscuit performance remained strong. While 4.7% revenue growth in biscuits was below the category rate our overall share performance was strong especially in North America and Europe. The difference was solely due to our China business.","Turning to chocolate. Our Cadbury, Dairy Milk and Milka Power Brands each grew high single digits fueling in our growth. In addition over 50% of revenues gained or held share. Our share performance in India in particular was strong, up over 2.5 in a category that continues to grow about 20%. Our results reflect recent capacity investments to support the tremendous from that market.","Turning to Gum and Candy, our revenues fell 2.1% as an increase in gum was more than offset by a decline in candy. Our gum share performance continue to improve as we gained a held share in over half of our gum revenues.","In beverages, our revenues increased 2.3% despite the headwinds from lower coffee pricing. Although the cost of green coffee has surged over the past two months from about a $1.20 to about $2 per pound, those prices are not yet reflected in the market. Input costs for the first half are still being covered [appraised] by prices. However, we recently announced price increases in Europe that will begin to take effect in late Q2. So, we expect higher pricings to be reflected in the back half of the year.","As for powdered beverages, category growth continued to be robust, for Tang up in the low 20s.","Let's now take a look at our regional results, where we delivered solid topline performance in 4 of our 5 regions. In Europe, while revenue fell 1%, coffee tampered growth by about 1.5 points. Vol\/mix was up nearly a point, despite the impact of the Easter shift and some short term customer dispute as we took (inaudible).","Over 70% of our revenues gained or held share. North America had another strong quarter, with revenue up 2.5%, fueled by 5% growth in biscuits. Share performance again was exceptional with over 85% of our revenue gaining or holding share.","Gum in the U.S. was up over a point. In emerging markets, as expected we experienced some share dislocations, as consumers adjusting to a higher pricing. As a leader in our categories and many of these markets, we're typically one of the first to price in response the higher input costs.","Input costs began to creep up at the end of last year especially in berry and coco and in many emerging markets, we prefer to see further magnified this impact.","As a result, we began to price aggressively early this year. In some cases competitors have been slow to follow resulting in sheer dislocation in some key markets. We expect this to be temporary as competitors ultimately price to offset the higher input costs, which are common to the entire industry.","Our EMEA region grew nearly 8% with good contributions from both vol mix and pricing. Russia increased high single-digits driven largely by vol mix; coffee, biscuits and gum drove the increase. Also in the region, the Gulf State, Turkey and Egypt all delivered strong growth. Not surprisingly, Ukraine declined double-digits.","In Latin America, pricing especially in the high inflation markets of Venezuela and Argentina drove organic growth of 14.7%. But importantly, Brazil was up high single-digits. Powdered beverages and biscuits drove the bulk of the revenue increase, while chocolate growth was modest due to the Easter shift. Asia-Pacific was our long lighting performer, down 2.7% for the quarter.","As expected, China was weak with organic revenue down mid-teens primarily due to biscuits. Easter\u2019s were working to in China are not new. We expect that to be China be drag in Q1 and through the first half as we lag last year's inventory build in support from our AMC investment and the launch of Golden Oreo.","While we continue to expect the China biscuit category to be soft for the remainder of the year likely growing in the low single-digits, our revenue trends in the second half should improve as we begin to lap last year\u2019s slower growth.","In contrast of biscuits, (inaudible) China continues to grow rapidly as expand distribution. Gum share is now over 7% just a year and half after launching in that market. We\u2019re taking a number of steps to improved China\u2019s overall performance.","Earlier this week, we hired Steven Mars, our new Head of China. Steven joins us from Carlsberg Group where he was CEO of the company\u2019s China business. In total he has 16 years of on the ground experience in China including principal P&G and Colgate. We are looking forward to Steven\u2019s leadership as he and his team gets China back on the growth trajectory.","India continues to deliver strong performance. With our new chocolate capacity in place, we have been able to regain the share we lost in the first half last year. Our beverages business which is now 5th of our sales there was up mid-teens. We continue to successfully expand our Tang business and increase support behind our top selling chocolate beverage Bournvita.","Turning to margins; adjusted gross margin was essentially flat with 37.1% as gross profit grew 2.3% on a constant currency basis. Pricing fully offset commodity inflation in dollar terms despite the fact that we\u2019ve not yet fully realized the impact of the pricing actions we implemented earlier this year.","On a percentage basis of course, the denominator effect of this pricing pressure of the gross margin percept. Net productivity was strong and in line with our goal to deliver 2.3% of cost of goods sold this year. As a result, our gross margin percentage was essentially flat to prior year.","In terms of adjusted OI margin, we jumped 140 basis points to 12.2%. Half of this gain was a direct result from our efforts to significantly reduce overheads. The other half came from AMC, which was about 9% of net revenue. This compared to last year\u2019s quarterly high of 9.6% when we accelerated investment in China.","To be clear, we didn\u2019t cut our base brand support. We successfully lowered AMC cost through efficiencies gained by consolidating our media accounts especially in EMEA, reducing non-working media spending and continuing to shift towards more efficient and targeted digital outcomes.","Consistent with our margin goals we made great progress this quarter towards achieving our adjusted OI margin targets in developed markets. Europe was up 130 basis points to 13.9% and North America was up 240 basis points to 13.8%.","Moving to EPS; adjusted EPS grew 17.1% on a constant currency basis driven by double-digit growth in operating income. The [logo] line, the impact of having a more normal tax rate was a negative $0.06 impact, but that was partially offset from $0.04 of favorability delivered through debt restructuring and share repurchases.","Before turning to guidance, I\u2019d like to quickly update you on where we stand on cash flow and capital allocation. Our approach to capital allocation remains the same. We\u2019ll continue to deploy capital to deliver the best expected returns whether it\u2019s reinvested in the business, M&A, reducing debt or returning capital to shareholders.","With regard to free cash flow, we remained on track to deliver a two year combined target of $3.7 billion. As you may know, we tend to be free cash flow negative in the first quarter as we rebuild inventories after seasonal lows at the end of the year.","At the end of Q1 this year, while our inventories were unusually high due to the Easter shift, we were still able to improve our cash conversion cycle by 17 days versus Q1 last year. In the first quarter we returned more than $700 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. For the full year, we still expect to return to $2 billion to $3 billion to our shareholders including $1 billion to $2 billion in stock buybacks.","With respect to our debt, we were up about $2 billion versus year-end largely reflecting cash returned to shareholders and the working capital increase that I just described. In addition, we paid taxes associated with the $2.8 billion Starbucks award that we received in December.","Turning to our outlook for the year, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth that\u2019s in line with overall category rates. However, as I described earlier, global category growth has slowed to around 3% for the last two quarters due largely to the weakness in emerging markets and lower coffee prices. We expect these trends will continue in Q2 likely resulting in top-line growth similar to what we saw in Q1.","In our second half, we expect the pass-through of higher Green coffee cards will benefit revenue, but we may also experience some disruptions to our top-line as we implement our strategic initiatives. As a result, we expect revenue growth to improve modestly in the second half. For the year then, we expect organic revenue growth to be in line with all the category growth of about 3%.","Importantly though, we remain confident in our profit outlook. Specifically we are confirming our guidance of double-digit adjusted OI growth on a constant currency basis, adjusted OI margin in the high 12% range and adjusted EPS of $1.73 to $1.78 on a constant currency basis.","With that let me turn it back to Irene for some closing thoughts.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks Dave. So to sum up, the strategic in cost reductions and actions that we announced today, underscore are determination to become a linear, more focused and more nimble global snacking power house. As our first quarter results show, we are making meaningful progress toward our margin goals, while continuing to deliver solid growth and market shares.","The actions we have outlined today will sharpen our focus on snacks, simplify our operations, enhanced and accelerate our ability to deliver world class margins, provides a fuel to invest in our core snacking business to drive top tier growth and position us to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. ","With that, I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have got a question about the coffee business, the coffee transaction. I guess the first is just simply Irene, can you talk about the strategic rational and maybe more specifically was it driven more by your view of some changes potentially occurring in the coffee industry or was it more specific to just how coffee sit in your portfolio?","Irene Rosenfeld","Actually Bryan coffee continues to be a very attractive category, it's growing -- category today within our portfolio is growing at good margin. In fact the margins are actually above our Mondel\u0113z average and we have seen terrific growth as you know in on demand in particular. But we saw a unique opportunity to combine our business, a very strong business with the DEMB portfolio. And I always think the partnership is a win-win. We received the upfront cash proceeds that we've described of approximately $5 billion after-tax. We intend to use the majority of that and as I said for share buybacks subject to our Board approval. But the balance will be used and the balance will be used for debt reduction and general corporate purposes, while still maintaining our investment grade credit rating.","We also thought at the same time received a 49% interest yet a very attractive company, it\u2019s a leading pure-play coffee company, it has a set of iconic brands with as I mentioned leading positions in over a dozen markets, it provides greater global scale and it's highly complementary in terms of the geographic footprint. All businesses come with some very unique technologies in R&D and in on-demand D.E Master Blenders have strong technology with good coffee.","We're going to combine the best-of-both from a management team standpoint. We feel very good about our partners as I mentioned, they\u2019re highly respected business executive. And if gives us the ability to focus on snacking portfolio much more directly and ensure that we have the opportunity to optimally allocate our resources.","So net-net, this is the opportunity to take what is a strong business and make it even stronger, while creating great value for the both partners I believe, as well as for our shareholders.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. And if I could just follow-up, a question for you Dave, just in terms of just the value of the deal, I think back of the envelope, if you get back a little bit less EBITDA than what you're contributing, but the net $5 billion of proceeds after cash, it's roughly similar in the neighborhood of $3 of incremental value creation that we saw this morning.","So I guess my question would be, is that kind of the right way to think about how we should be thinking about valuating the transaction? And then also just connected to that in terms of cash flow with this business going into JV, just what\u2019s the mechanism for the JV to kick the cash flow back to Mondel\u0113z? Thank you.","Dave Brearton","","Yes, I think on the valuation, if you look at it in a lot ways, I mean [carefully] we're putting in our business and so it's more about the upside of the two businesses combined that\u2019s going to generate the value for this business. I don't think -- it\u2019s just kind of complicated when you saw joint ventures I don't think we'll get into that. But I think you\u2019ve seen the multiple that D.E Master Blenders was purchase at and I think clearly that was one other consideration as we put our business into that.","In terms of cash flow, today the coffee cash flow obviously is part of our ongoing free cash flow and as Irene mentioned OI margin is above the average of our business, so it\u2019s pretty healthy cash flow. That we obviously lose. We\u2019re going to pick up $5 billion upfront and then the ongoing cash flow will come from dividends. And actually we filed an 8-K this morning along with the press release and you can see the dividend specifics in there. But it\u2019s a relatively fixed amount for the first three years and then it\u2019s tied to net operating profit thereafter. So, we\u2019ll get a dividend instead of the ongoing cash flow of our business. Clearly that will be a lower number in aggregate but we get $5 billion upfront in cash.","Dexter Congbalay","Operator, get the next question please.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","","Should we expect -- I guess on slide 12 you show the impact form the coffee transaction. First off, I assume that\u2019s the impact of stranded overheads and if so, it looks like you expect these accelerated cost saves ZBB and such will more than cover those overheads by \u201816 but would we expect this to be a linear path or to margin need to take a step back in \u201815 when your stranded costs come out and then get immediately offset by the incremental savings?","Dave Brearton","","Yes. I think when you look at that page, the red bar there, it isn\u2019t so much about stranded overheads; it\u2019s just that as Irene mentioned earlier the OI margin on coffee is higher than the Mondel\u0113z average. So it has a small decrement to our average OI margin. I think the stranded overhead piece is actually quite small. Most of the people in the overheads that are associated with our coffee business today will transfer over to the new company. There will be some stranded overheads but it\u2019s relatively small and it would be taken out through the restructuring program that we\u2019ve talked about today as well.","As it relates to 2015 margins, we didn\u2019t give you a margin target for 2015 today, mostly because it\u2019s going to be tied largely to the timing of the closing of coffee transaction, the progress we make on the work councils and union discussions. But this year, we\u2019ll be in the high 12s in our OI margin. In 2016, we\u2019ll be between \u201815 and \u201816. And we\u2019d expect to make measurable progress towards that 2016 goal next year. So, it\u2019s hard for me to give you guidance specifically on 2015 given some of the timings things that I can\u2019t predict today but we\u2019ll make measurable progress.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","That\u2019s really helpful. And then the one thing that surprises me I guess about your comment about stranded overhead is, that was always one of the -- I think one of the reasons that was always given as to why it was important that coffee and grocery I guess to the extent be part of Mondel\u0113z for that scale impact and recovering of fixed and such in some of the European region. And so, I guess I would have thought by parting with that there would be a bigger headwind to cover from that. And I think in certain markets like Russia, if I am not mistaking, you can kind of go to market between coffee and chocolate kind of on the similar system. So I guess just a little clarity on that would be helpful.","Dave Brearton","Yes, I think it\u2019s really because of the structure of the transaction we\u2019ve talked about today. As we create the new company, the two businesses are highly complementary but aren\u2019t that many countries where we have major overlaps. So in a place like Russia, we\u2019re going to be carving out a coffee sales force for the new company and providing that to the new company. So that\u2019s the biggest difference from what you would have expected from the sale transaction because it\u2019s the new company that we\u2019re partnering with, we can contribute most of the people and the overheads and cash to that new company. And because it\u2019s largely complementary in terms of geography, it\u2019s -- they\u2019re going to need most of those costs. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s different versus the historical factors as we have had. But you\u2019re right, a lot of the countries have combined sales forces today, so that\u2019s an exercise we need to go through over the next years.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Hi, good morning.","Dave Brearton","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Hi. I had just a follow up on the interest question. I had a question regarding the -- looking at scale little differently and that is scale at retail and how that taken away the coffee asset speed in Europe or even Eastern Europe we have an effect on your growth profile with European call grocery business, do you see any effect from losing this business in that regard?","Irene Rosenfeld","We actually see the opportunity because coffee is much more of a center of store kind of item and our snacking business tends to be more front-end and imports driven, we actually see the opportunity to focus for respective selling organizations on what they do best. It\u2019s not unlike the kind of thinking we had as we put the North American grocery business up. So we actually are looking for these new selling organizations to be a lot more focused on their respective categories and actually we believe that will help to drive growth.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. And then just a follow up question on revenue growth, as you look at revenues for the year, the plus 3%, have you considered a higher degree of price realization coming through to support that growth? And are there any pricing [exercise] taken as some, as you said there may be some short term challenges with market share, but anywhere we are seeing these challenges getting to pricing as you expected earlier in the year?","Dave Brearton","Yes, the revenue growth we have given was essentially [pricing] category growth rate, I think both are revenue and the category will reflect a lot more pricing this year and probably a lot more -- a lot less volume mix growth. So that\u2019s difficult when you have price taken increases. In terms of the pricing so far, it\u2019s a bit early to tell, we are putting a lot of the pricing in emerging markets early in the first quarter. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, competitors some have followed, some have not. But I think its common into industry, I would expect it to come through. Europe is a little bit later, because it takes a while to negotiate the price increases with the trade in Europe. So, we're not going to see the full benefit of that come through until Q2.","So, it's a bit early to tell, but I think historically when we've had commodity increases that are common to industry, we've been able to price away those costs. And so I would expect that it will come through as we're planning this year.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Congratulation. You mentioned revenue growth of 3% for the year, which is close to the growth rate of the first quarter. That first quarter includes a point drag however from Easter and coffee deflation which are factors that when we think will reverse in Q2 or at least Q3 in the case of coffee prices. Are you seeing a slowdown in your base business or actually anticipating disruption from the restructuring as you think about that 3%?","Dave Brearton","I think it is -- you are correct, the first quarter had 40 basis points of an Easter impact and about 60 basis points of coffee. I think the coffee we expect to continue in the second quarter. I think the -- we did say, we would expect some positive bounce in as coffee goes from being a headwind to potentially even a tailwind in the back half. But I think the flip side of that is as you mentioned, there could be some disruption from some of the strategic initiatives we put in place. And frankly, we're just being prudent. The category has grown over the last two quarters now around 3%. And so we felt it was prudent to not count on a terrific turnaround and to plan on that for the balance of the quarter. So, it's not just a quarter one comment, it's been six months now of about 3% category growth.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","And how much of your business will be Europe pre and post the deal? Thank you.","Irene Rosenfeld","","It\u2019s down about 1 or 2 percentage point there in that if you look at the configuration post transaction close.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Just a follow-up on the questions on revenue growth. I know it's difficult to pull out the crystal ball on this, but how confident are you that you'll see some recovery in category trends in 2015 and beyond? And just as you're thinking about prospects for EPS growth given your new margin targets, are you assuming a gradual recovery back to 4% to 5% or sales growth or thinking about this, the new run rate?","Irene Rosenfeld","","That\u2019s one of the reasons we took the actions that we announced today is to ensure that despite what happens on our top-line even if trends continue with the same rate that we have great confidence that we can deliver on the margin target and therefore on our EPS commitments.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And Dave, you spoke to the cash costs, the restructuring program being largely front loaded during the first two years. Just as we're thinking about the phasing of cost savings and the potential for margin expansion beyond 2016, can you give us a rough sense of what portion of the $1.5 billion in restructuring savings should be realized by 2016?","Dave Brearton","","I think it will flow through pretty steadily. The upfront yeas will be more overhead less supply chain, the later years will be more supply chain, because that takes a little longer to get underway. So, I don't think you'll see a massive skew. I wouldn't expect a huge impact this year though.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And just as we\u2019re thinking about the margin progression again for those out years, is there any degree of expected base margin expansion that\u2019s now just being pulled forward in a way that would moderate the margin prospects for those latter two years?","Dave Brearton","","I think we haven\u2019t given a specific margin target beyond 2016, mostly because it\u2019s quite away from now. But we have said we\u2019ll be 15% to 16% in 2016 as an OI margin and the savings that are going to come beyond that in 2017 and \u201818 should allow us to continue to make margin progress in \u201817 and \u201818. And obviously we\u2019ll continue to invest in our businesses just to drive growth while we are doing all of that through that entire prior period.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Alright, thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","","Good morning everybody.","Dave Brearton","","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","","I guess just first on the coffee if I could ask a question, you noticed, knowing that it\u2019s high teens margins but that\u2019s drawing a very low cyclical point in coffee cost, so kind of what is more of a normalized coffee margin for the business?","Dave Brearton","","I think you have to define what normal coffee costs are. I think 1.20 two months ago was actually not far off the 10 year average, 2 bucks is obviously pretty high and you are absolutely correct though the revenue creates a bigger denominator if green coffee goes up and reduce that margin. But I think it has been historically pretty consistently higher OI margin than the rest of our business.","Irene Rosenfeld","","That\u2019s also been particularly true Eric as we shifted from roast and ground business, predominantly roast and ground business more into on demand and soluble and that\u2019s been a trend that has been improving over the last couple of years as we have made those investments in (inaudible) for example.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then more about kind of the restructuring, maybe following up a little bit on Matt\u2019s question. I guess Irene, followed you for a long time at Craft and now Mondel\u0113z, I mean there is just you\u2019ve made a lot of well received strategic rules, but I would say that so much restructuring so much cash leaving really historically has it led to great fundamental performance. This was [growthco] 18 months ago and the top-line target has now taken a complete back seat. So if I was working in Mondel\u0113z I would be kind of wondering what are my targets. I used to be let\u2019s say recruited here to be a brand manager with growth and now it\u2019s all about cost savings and ZBB. So I guess as we kind of go through this next iteration of change in restructuring like what how do you keep people like focused or motivated and how disruption are you, do you think is going to occur from so much going on within the company?","Irene Rosenfeld","Eric I think you make a fair observation. I would remind you as you know our last restructuring program was in 2004 and 2008. We did deliver the targeted savings under that program but we had a business that was severely in need of reinvestment at that time. And if you recall in 2006 our shares were declining our product quality was not where it needed to be, we didn\u2019t have an innovation pipeline. So we did reinvest most of our savings back into the business and quite frankly I would argue we have created some great value on a number of those businesses which allowed us a lot of this put off to North American grocery business and create great value for shareholders.","At this point though we\u2019re in a very different position. Our shares have now been consistently positive for a couple of years. We\u2019ve got our investments up to where we need them to be on our snacking businesses and I have great confidence that the savings that we have laid out, you will see reflected in our P&L and exactly made the commitments today to take up the bottom end of our rates over these next couple of years and as we have said we actually see some additional upside beyond that as a consequence of the investments.","With respect to how should employees react, there is a lot to absorb here, there is no question about that but our employees are committed to creating this global snacking power house that we will leave in the market place and it is clear that as the environment has changed in large measure, it was imperative that we take appropriate actions to address some of the inefficiencies in our cost structure while continuing to drive growth, if anything the number of the actions that we are describing today will certainly help our margins but will also give us the fuel to reinvest in growth.","So I actually don\u2019t take an inconsistent message, we continue to outperform our peers in most markets around the world, it\u2019s just a more challenging environment so I think we all had imagined as we created this company 18 months ago, but net-net I have great confidence that the actions that we are taking today will make us a stronger company and increase confidence in our ability to deliver top tier financial results.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Thanks. I will pass it on. Good luck.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hey, thanks for the question. Dave I don\u2019t think you addressed this, forgive me if you did. Can you help us to understand how much net debt the new coffee-co had on its balance sheet? I am asking just because if we are trying to model the improvement in your non-controlling interest, I guess we want better understand to how much interest expense that entity will have. So is it fair to assume [BE] will finance the $5 billion with all debt, how much legacy interest expense of debt do they have, just curious for any color you can help with there. Thanks","Dave Brearton","Yes. I don't want to get too much into the financing of the new company. But if you look at the 8-K we issued today. I have highlighted that we're taking out 4 billion euros which is the $5 billion we referred to. And the [JAB] folks are talking out \u20ac2.5 billion and I think any all the financing of that would be in the new company, it will be nothing at our level or above that.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research","Unidentified Analyst","(Inaudible) and with few questions on behalf of David. Hello?","Dave Brearton","Go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Just wanted to know if you could give us what's the combined pro forma EBITDA for the new coffee business will be? And then going forward what type of, what level of cost synergies do you think will be able to be achieved by combining the businesses?","Dave Brearton","Yes, I think as we said today, we think the new company will have margins in the high teens on the EBITDA level, we haven't given any cost synergy numbers. I think I would say that some of the excitement of this business is that it\u2019s highly complementary both in technology as well as geographic platforms in brand. So, I would say the revenue synergies frankly are as exciting of any cost synergies that could come out of it.","And as I mentioned earlier, on line of the countries that our business is in, they are not and vice-versa So, I think this is as much about being a global pure play coffee company as it is about traditional synergies.","Unidentified Analyst","And so on your kind of accretion analysis and innings of that accretion in the first full year, you are saying there is not much in a way of cost synergies kind of baked into that projection?","Dave Brearton","I would say that I'm not going to get into specifics of the new company's business plan, but I would say that as we talk about accretion of the first full year that reflects the cash we received and assuming the majority of that cash goes to buy back shares with a substantial portion potentially for debt pay down as well. So, I think that's more driver and the fact that we will be consolidating 49% of the net income of the company as minority interest position within our earnings per share number. So that's way that really comes from.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And one last thing on chocolate, can you just talk a little bit about the range of price increases that you\u2019ve taken and just kind of generally how well have they have been excepted thus far?","Dave Brearton","It varies a lot. I mean in Europe obviously the pricing to recover the cocoa and dairy cost and most recently not costs. And those costs, those price increases were negotiated in the first quarter and we've got those lined up, but they really didn't impact our revenue until late in March. So you'll see those kind of flow through in the second quarter. I really don't want to get into net price increases, because frankly that gets into trade deals and other things.","In the emerging market is much higher, because not only a recovery in cocoa and dairy, we\u2019re also cutting the currency impact in most of those countries. So you're looking at price increases in emerging markets anywhere from high single-digits to mid-teens it depends on the country.","So it's fairly significant in emerging market. Those mostly were put in place in the first quarter and they're playing through and I would expect that those are on the shelf in most of those countries obviously that are there today.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","A couple of quick housekeeping questions on the coffee transaction. The dividend income stream that you disclosed in the 8-K, the split between Acorn and you, should we use the same ratio as the cash distribution?","Dave Brearton","I would use the same ratio of the ownership of the future company.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Timing wise some time in 2015 it sounds like you are pretty confident in terms of regulatory approval, why such a protracted timeline?","Dave Brearton","","It\u2019s not just regulatory approval, it\u2019s also the works council consultations that we need to go through in Europe. So as with any transaction like this, you need to consult with the works councils and you need to complete those consultations before you can close the transaction on the case of absence where you can actually accept the offer. So there is a process we need to follow.","We went through the same process when we bought the biscuit business from the Danone. So we understand that process pretty well. And it\u2019s just a question of timing. So it will be sometime in the course of 2015 and that\u2019s why we have been a bit reluctant to give a specific guidance for next year and we have really focused on this year in 2016.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And one last question, back to fundamentals. Looking at slide 16 where you showed geographic your share performance, great share performance in the developed markets, a relatively soft performance across each region of emerging markets. Can you give us some more color on what\u2019s driving that share weakness and on a forward what you expect and why?","Dave Brearton","","Yes, I think if you go back over the last two years we have been pretty consistently strong and shares across all other region. So this is an aberration, but as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we took pricing in the first quarter and in most of those markets we are the price leader. And so we have priced to recover commodity and ForEx impacts within our cost. And we\u2019ve successfully done that through. Some of our competitors are lagging those price increases. But in the end these are all common to industry cost increases. So I would be surprised if they don\u2019t eventually come up. So I would expect that to normalize. It\u2019s fairly typical when we are in the price increase environment; price leader takes a bit of it after the first few months.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Got it, makes sense. Thanks a lot guys, I will pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Hi everyone.","Irene Rosenfeld","Hi Ken.","Dave Brearton","Good morning.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","I have just a big picture, what was the catalyst to push you to reevaluate the extent of your margin structure. I mean you guys have been looking at the portfolio for some time, what pushed you to do this mix restructuring effort?","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, as our global categories have slowed down particularly in the emerging markets, the need to drive best-in-class cost becomes that much more important for us to deliver on our bottom-line commitments. And so we\u2019ve been talking about that for quite some time now. Obviously there was a big subject of discussion with our Board at our strategic plan last summer. And we\u2019ve been working on a number of these initiatives.","We shared with you the early thinking on supply chain, at back-to-school we talked to you about some of the work that we were just beginning on zero-based budgeting with respect to overhead at -- and what we\u2019ve announced today essentially reflects the combination of those activities. Obviously the coffee transaction is something that was happening concurrent with the number of these other thoughts, but they\u2019re highly interrelated and that\u2019s why we have great confidence that as we take these actions together that we will be able to drive additional margin expansion sooner, while still continuing to support our franchises.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Would you expect to have anymore additional actions to be taken in terms of it is a portfolio refinement or even another level deeper into cost not at this coffee structuring is not excellent I don\u2019t want to minimize that and the effort there. But is there I mean as you get deeper and deeper in this, do you think this ball is going to keep on rolling in terms of portfolio refinement and cost restructuring?","Irene Rosenfeld","I think the cost piece of it we\u2019re committing to approximately 300 to 400 basis points improvement over these next three years, that\u2019s a fairly substantial commitment that we\u2019re making on the margin front and we\u2019ve got some very strong programs behind that. We\u2019ll continue to push as aggressively as we can, but I think the target that we\u2019ve laid out are quite aggressive. And as we suggested, we see the opportunities as we make some of our supply chain investments to help accelerate our delivery there. That will have some benefits beyond 2016. So I think the commitments we have made today are quite aggressive. At the same time from a portfolio standpoint, this coffee transaction was a unique opportunity to create the world\u2019s largest pure play coffee company, and we believe we have accomplished that by creating great value for both partners and creating good value for our shareholders, both today and then looking into the future.","So we feel quite pleased with the overall implications of the transactions and as well as the actions that we\u2019ve announced today.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Great, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Can I ask about -- two quick questions. Does your emerging market exposure that I think is 40% today change out after this coffee deal. The second one is does the 15% to 16% margin goal by 2016 still stands even after the coffee is excluded from consolidated earnings? And then finally, just following up on Ken\u2019s question. Could you imagine structuring a similar deal for the cheese and grocery to business which seems even less strategic than the coffee business? Thank you very much?","Irene Rosenfeld","So Alexia, our emerging market business will still be about 40% of the portfolio after the transaction. The second question was\u2026","Dave Brearton","The margin, the 15% to 16% margin already takes out coffee, so there is a small coffee decrement that goes in there because coffee has higher margins the rest of portfolio but that\u2019s more than aid up by the savings on the restructuring program.","Irene Rosenfeld","And then the last question on the portfolio, as I said coffee is a very unique opportunity for us to create value and we are not going to get into any other hypothetical at this point in time.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Bumgarner with Wells Fargo.","John Bumgarner - Wells Fargo","Irene, in the absence of seeing some reinvestment in this coffee proceeds, it\u2019s to route to market and wide space growth, how do you see the return on investment as global category growth is slowed; have returns deteriorated at all or how are you thinking about developing markets reinvestment going forward? Thanks.","Irene Rosenfeld","Well, I think we've seen some -- a number of good returns on the investments that we made particularly in a number of our markets last year as we thought at that time, we make some investments in route to market in Brazil, in Russia and in India and we've seen great paybacks there. But one place we saw less of a return, has been in China and as we talked, we have pulled back quite a bit from some of those investments.","So, we continue to look at these markets on a pay as you go basis. We're monitoring whether or not, we're getting the return as we make investments in areas like route to market. But we have a strong desire to make sure that we are creating the necessary investments in our infrastructure to enable us to benefit as the markets recover.","So, I think we've got the right balance here between continuing to make investments that deliver attractive returns while ensuring showing that we're not overinvesting if the markets are not responding as well. So, we keep a very close eye on that.","John Bumgarner - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thanks Irene.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research.","Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research","First question is just I'm curious, I know JV I believe also and to keep comparable in the U.S. And I just can't remember, when you spun -- when you split Mondel\u0113z in Kraft Foods, is there any agreement in place such that you can or can\u2019t operate in Kraft market? I'm just asking just of chance three years, four years kind of wherever you could find that the U.S. is actually very attractive coffee market, are you allowed to sell coffee in U.S.?","Irene Rosenfeld","We are not precluding for selling coffee in the U.S.","Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research","Okay, perfect. Thanks. And then second, when JV purchased D.E Master Blenders, D.E Master Blenders was obviously spun from Sara Lee. There was a great story behind it. As they sort of kind of work through their strategy upfront before JV bought them, they found themselves actually kind of facing a bit of pressure, mostly on the top-line but then some of the margin estimates came under question et cetera. JV decided this job of being able to purchase the asset but considered potentially trough margins and earnings.","Now that you're working with JV kind of post purchasing D.E Master Blenders have like what have you -- I'm not sure if you can provide any color on this. But have you seen that their strategy with the business before the JV with you and then accurate is really more cost focus -- cost saving focused or is this something that we should be thinking as sort of another phase of growth co or and cost co or is it more of a cost savings opportunity? Thanks.","Irene Rosenfeld","As you can imagine, we are in a position to be able to make a lot of statements about the combined company going forward. But I will tell you, as I think our approaches to the business are quite well aligned and that's why we see great opportunity and we're pleased to have a 49% of the combined company going forward.","Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management.","Dexter Congbalay","","Hi, this is Dexter. Nick and I will be around for the rest of the day to answer any questions you might have. Other than that, thank you all for joining the call and we will talk to you later.","Operator","","Thank you.

Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Shep, and good morning.","Despite a challenging environment, we continued to deliver solid results, and we're confident in delivering our 2016 outlook and 2018 margin targets. I'm pleased with the progress made by our teams in reinventing our supply chain, reducing overheads, and reinvesting in growth. Our strategy is working, driving strong near-term margin performance, providing fuel for investment, and positioning us to sustainably deliver top and bottom line growth.","Long term, we expect our advantaged platform together with an ongoing focus on growth and margin expansion to drive organic net revenue at or above our category rates, double-digit adjusted EPS growth, improving cash generation, and significant return of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","With that as context, let's review the highlights of the second quarter. Organic revenue grew 1.5%, including the negative impact of about a point from revenue management actions. Through the first half, our growth rate was 1.9%. Our power brands once again drove our top line, up 3% and in line with global categories. Emerging markets rose nearly 4%, fueled by currency-driven pricing in markets like Argentina and Russia. Developed markets were essentially flat but delivered another positive quarter of vol\/mix while continuing to significantly expand margins.","Our overall share performance was not yet where we wanted it to be, but we began to see meaningful improvements in a number of key markets, like chocolate in the UK, Germany, Australia, and India, as well as biscuits in Europe, and globally across our gum and candy business. This progress was partially offset by declines in some large markets such as U.S. biscuits and Brazil, where our near-term share positions were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive trade promotions. Brian will discuss market share in more detail in a moment.","Adjusted OI margin for the second quarter was strong, up 210 basis points versus prior year. Cost control has now become embedded in our culture and we're firing on all cylinders, both in supply chain as well as in overheads. These first half results position us well for the full year. Our focus on cost enables us to expand margins while continuing to fuel growth.","In that spirit, let me take you through two exciting opportunities that will be important drivers going forward. First, we're delighted to announce the launch of our Milka brand into China's $2.8 billion chocolate market. This is a prime example of the growth strategy in action. As we've discussed, most of our emerging markets are one- or two-category countries. We added gum to our leading China biscuit business in the second half of 2012. And today that business generates annual revenue of approximately $200 million.","By leveraging a formidable power brand like Milka in a sizeable category white space, we see significant potential for chocolate in a market where per capita consumption is quite low, even by emerging market standards. We expect our unique brand assets, industry-leading innovation, a new world-class manufacturing facility, and strong sales and marketing capabilities will not only grow our business, but will also accelerate the category.","While chocolate in China has recently been challenged, we believe we're well positioned to succeed. Our plans have been presented to customers and we'll enter the market in the next few weeks, well before the critical Chinese New Year season.","Finally, while only a small part of our business today, we have significantly bolstered our capabilities in e-commerce. Although online snacks are relatively under-developed, we believe e-commerce will be increasingly important as consumer purchasing behavior changes. Our intent is to capture share in this fast-growing channel by leveraging our strong brands and marketing knowhow.","Since the start of the year, we've taken a number of steps, including: enhancing our infrastructure; adding new experience resources and building capability; strengthening our partnerships with Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba in China, and with the e-commerce arms of our traditional retailers; as well as accelerating gift offers with personalized packaging and subscriptions on brands like Cadbury in the UK.","Early results are very encouraging. In the first half, we grew our e-commerce revenue by more than 30%. Looking ahead, our goal is snacking leadership in e-commerce and over $1 billion in sales by 2020.","The launch of chocolate in China and our progress in e-commerce are just two examples of investments that are continuing to build and transform our advantaged platform.","Looking ahead, there's no question that the environment remains challenging, especially in emerging markets. We remain focused on what we can control, margin and share. To that end, we're taking a number of actions that will impact the second half. These include: increased A&C on our power brands; targeted investments in trade spending to narrow price gaps in key markets; several significant innovation launches, including chocolate in China; and continued expansion of our routes to market, including e-commerce, all while continuing to drive cost reduction across the enterprise.","We remain confident in our strategy and execution to grow both our top and bottom lines over the long term and to create significant value for our shareholders.","Before I close, I know many of you would like an update on the potential transaction with Hershey. While I can confirm that we did make an offer to Hershey, as you would expect regarding any potential M&A activity, we have no additional comments to make.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Irene.","We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2, as the negative impact of mark-to-market as well as currency-driven inflation offset another quarter of strong net productivity. In fact, our efforts to reinvent our supply chain and deploy advantaged manufacturing lines of the future continue to drive margin benefits, as we delivered net productivity of better than 3.5% for the first half.","Q2 adjusted OI margin was 15.2%, up 210 basis points. This was largely driven by the ongoing ZBB [Zero-Based Budgeting] impact on our overheads and especially our execution on shared service initiatives. In addition, the margin expansion included some one-time favorable impacts from asset sales in North America. These proceeds more or less offset the negative impacts of mark-to-market and the cost of our U.S. labor-related business continuity planning.","We're pleased with our first half margin performance and are slightly ahead of our plan, as our cost execution has exceeded expectations. We're also investing in additional A&C and selected incremental trade spending during the second half to support top line growth and improve share.","Let me now provide some color on regional performance for both revenue and margins. North America had a very solid \u2013 a very strong margin quarter. Adjusted OI margins expanded by 470 basis points, driven by strong productivity, overhead cost reductions, as well as the previously mentioned asset sale benefit, offset somewhat by the U.S. labor business continuity planning costs. We grew organic revenue nearly 1%, driven by vol\/mix increases. Escalated trade spending by our competitors negatively affected our short-term results.","Overall, biscuits were up only modestly. But Oreo, belVita, and Triscuit all delivered solid consumption growth. Candy posted strong results, driven by Sour Patch Kids and Hall's. In gum, Trident turned in another quarter of solid performance, and we began the relaunch of Stride late in the quarter, which should improve shares in the months ahead. As Irene mentioned, we have several strong programs in place to better position us for the second half.","Europe also had an outstanding margin quarter, with adjusted OI margin up 350 basis points to 18%, driven by strong productivity and lower overheads. Organic revenue in Europe was essentially flat, although here too we're seeing a nice progression in vol\/mix and share trends. Both our chocolate and biscuit categories delivered strong results in the UK and Germany, which helped grow vol\/mix by 70 basis points for the region. Building on last year's launch in the UK, we also lunched Ritz Crisp & Thin crackers in France, which is delivering good results, as we take the brand to a new consumption occasion.","In EEMEA [Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa], adjusted OI margins were flat, driven by weaker demand and the resulting volume leverage impact. Organic revenue declined more than 2%, driven by a slowdown in the Middle East and North Africa, where economic and geopolitical volatility, including the impact of low oil prices, is having a more pronounced effect on consumer demand. A very weak Ramadan season in the Middle East also tempered the top line. Despite that backdrop, Russia turned in a solid performance, growing low double digits as a result of pricing actions to offset inflation.","In Asia-Pacific, our adjusted OI margins were up 190 basis points, driven by improved overheads, strong productivity, and pricing. Organic revenue increased 2% and vol\/mix was positive, up more than 1%. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Asia. India benefited from the launch of Bournvita biscuits, which addresses consumers' growing need for a morning snack under a well-known brand that delivers taste and nutrition. Chocolate also generated solid gains.","Australia was also strong while Southeast Asia was up for the third straight quarter. Our Kinh Do business in Vietnam continues to be a bright spot. Our teams are executing well as we integrate this business, which provides a platform to drive our power brands through its distribution network of 130,000 outlets.","China declined low single digits, as the biscuit category slowed and we lapped last year's Trident gum launch. While overall China consumer demand has recently slowed, we believe longer-term dynamics will improve, as evidenced by our significant investment in chocolate that Irene discussed earlier.","In Latin America, adjusted OI margins declined 210 basis points. Difficult economic conditions in Brazil pressured margins in the form of currency and volume headwinds. Latin America organic revenue grew nearly 9%, led by strength in Argentina and Mexico. Argentina grew double digits primarily due to inflation-driven pricing, while Mexico had a strong first half and continued to gain momentum, as strong vol\/mix contributed to high single-digit revenue growth. Brazil declined low single digits, and we see no short-term catalyst for improvement in the Brazilian economy. We're taking actions to close selected price gaps, but we expect the market to remain challenging in terms of both revenue and margins at least through the second half.","Let me spend a moment providing a few highlights by category. In aggregate, categories have slowed to about 3% year to date, driven by key emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India. Our global biscuits business grew nearly 2%, with strength in the UK, in the U.S., and Germany. Oreo led the way, growing high single digits.","In addition, we're continuing to drive our well-being portfolio. belVita grew high single digits globally, while our GOOD THiNS innovation in the U.S. also posted solid results.","While our biscuits share has been challenged in some key markets, we have a number of actions underway to address the issue. In the U.S., we're innovating across several winning biscuit platforms while investing incremental trade spending behind our DSD [Direct Store Delivery] execution. In Brazil, we're investing in additional advertising and consumer support while selectively narrowing price gaps on key SKUs. Our focus remains on improving our share position. We expect the incremental actions we're taking will improve our share position in the second half.","Chocolate grew more than 2%, driven by solid results in India, Australia, and the UK. Also in the quarter, Germany continued to deliver strong growth as we lapped last year's revenue management actions. More than half of our revenue in chocolate grew share.","Gum and candy increased nearly 2%, led by solid performance in the U.S. and Mexico. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.","Now turning to earnings per share, for Q2, our adjusted EPS was up more than 4% on a constant currency basis, which includes the impact of coffee dilution. And for the first half, adjusted EPS increased 17% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains of $0.15 were the primary driver of the improvement.","Below the line, adjusted EPS declined $0.01, as dilution from last year's coffee deal more than offset benefits from lower share count, taxes, and interest expense. Note that this will be the last quarter of coffee dilution, as we lap the close of last year's coffee transactions. I would note that both JDE and Keurig performed well in the quarter and contributed some upside versus our expectations.","In the second quarter, we delivered more than $500 million of free cash flow and improved our cash conversion cycle by 20 days to minus four days. Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority for us, and we've returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through the first half. We've repurchased more than $1.3 billion in our shares at an average price of $41.07, and we continue to target $2 billion in share repurchases for the year.","Last week, we also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. Dividends remain an important part of our capital return strategy, as we target a payout of at least 30%. Since the spin, we've returned nearly $13 billion of cash to shareholders.","Let's take a closer look at our current outlook. As you've heard today, we feel good about our first half results and expect continued strong performance in the second half despite the macro backdrop, especially in the emerging markets.","Specifically, we now expect the following for 2016. We've modestly reduced our organic net revenue growth outlook to approximately 2% from at least 2%. This reflects the increasing challenges we're seeing in global categories and includes about 100 basis points from revenue management actions.","We continue to expect adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% and are increasingly confident in delivering this commitment. As you think about the second half, we expect heavier investments in the third quarter, which would lead to higher margins in the fourth quarter.","We continue to expect double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. Our view now includes an incremental $0.03 to $0.05 versus our last outlook due to solid operating performance, lower interest expense, and strong performance in our coffee joint ventures. Unfortunately, based on recent spot rates, this upside will be mostly offset by currency. We expect currency to be a four-point headwind to revenue growth, up from three points. And for adjusted EPS, we estimate an $0.08 headwind, up from $0.05.","This also includes our view of the Brexit impact on our results, which is limited to an approximate $0.02 headwind related to the currency translation impact on our UK-based earnings. Our net transaction exposure is very limited, as we buy a majority of our global cocoa needs in British pounds, which offsets net transaction exposure in the UK.","So to summarize our EPS outlook, the upside we're seeing in EPS allows us to fully offset the negative impact of currency changes, including Brexit. Finally, we still expect free cash flow, excluding items, of at least $1.4 billion.","So to wrap up, we're pleased with our results in the first half. We delivered significant margin expansion while continuing to invest behind our power brands. Our vol\/mix performance continued to improve, and we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the challenging operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our top and bottom line targets, and we remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Chris.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I had just two questions for you, if I could, to start off. And the first question I wanted to ask was just in relation to your developed versus developing market growth. This quarter seemed to show a little softer growth in developed markets actually. I had expected a little bit of pressure in Brazil and some of those markets, and you certainly cited those. But overall emerging market growth was about consistent with where it was in the first quarter. Do you expect that to weaken a bit as it goes to the second half as some of these markets are more challenged? And is it developed markets then pick up a little bit in the second half of the year from where they are currently?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, I think, Chris, you have to separate \u2013 I think your assessment about emerging markets is correct. Obviously, we're feeling like \u2013 having watched what's happening, particularly in Brazil, we're seeing more softness there than we had anticipated. But I'd say in our developed markets it's really all about North America. And Europe is actually continuing to improve sequentially. We're seeing strong vol\/mix performance. We're seeing nice performance on share. And so the big change is really on our U.S. biscuit business, whereas we mentioned we saw some very aggressive trade spending from some of our competition. It is not helping to grow the category, but we certainly are responding. And I would tell you even in the early couple of weeks in July we're starting to see that business come back.","So net-net, we do expect our developed markets to continue to show strong performance in terms of vol\/mix improvement as well as share. But our overall forecast continues to be somewhat muted because the aggregate category growth, which we had thought would be in the 3% to 4% range, is below the lower end of that range, and that's really what's driving our forecast.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The other thing I would add, Chris, is just emerging \u2013 the growth was similar in Q1 and Q2, but the quality in terms of vol\/mix got better. So it's not nearly as price driven as it was in the first quarter.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay; that's helpful. Thank you for that color. Just a quick question for you then on the guidance. Obviously, the revenue growth guidance has moderated a bit and so has the SKU rationalization expectation or activity there. On the margin side, are you seeing a little better margin? I think we were pushing more toward the low end of that range. Is 15% to 16% now a better range, if you will, versus the low end for your operating margin in 2016?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I wouldn't change, Chris, the view. We feel really good about the first half. As I said, we're a bit ahead on the cost execution. Given the dynamics in the market, clearly it's a volatile environment, and we are planning to invest back and probably more than we would have expected in the first half of the year in the second half to drive some improvement in those shares and the growth. So I think we feel good with where we are. We're not really changing the outlook on margins. And being at 15%-plus for the first half gives us confidence for sure, but we're going to invest.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay; thanks so much for your time.","Shep Dunlap - Vice President, Investor Relations, Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to ask, I guess, a more broad question about capital allocation, and completely understanding that you can't talk specifically about Hershey. But one question that we've fielded quite a bit over the last few weeks has been just from a broader perspective, Irene, that you're at a point now where you're considering doing a relatively good-sized acquisition. Can you just talk to how you get to that point? Is it because the company is at a point now where you feel like you're ready to make a \u2013 can take on a transaction like that? Does it make a statement about what you think maybe the medium or longer-term outlook is for some of the categories, given what's changed in emerging markets? Just some context or color in terms of how you got to the point where you're ready to at least contemplate potentially making a large transaction.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Bryan, our capital allocation strategy has not changed. And as I said in my remarks, we have no additional comments on the Hershey situation.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay; thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, everybody.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two things for me. One, the move into China with the Milka brand -- I guess my question there is following on to Bryan's really is more about timing. I guess why is now the right time for something like that? Are there capabilities now that you didn't have before that you have now? Is it there's more clarity on productivity efforts that enable the investment at this point? I'm really trying to get a better read on the timing of this announcement because obviously the white space here in China in chocolate has been around for quite some time.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So we have been planning this for some time, as you said. And one of the most important poles in that tent is local production. And so we have a factory now up and running in Suzhou, and it's ready to go. We have continued to monitor the marketplace to understand the opportunities, both in terms of our portfolio as well as in our channels. And obviously, e-commerce is an important channel for us in China, and our partnership with Alibaba is a critical piece of our launch plan. So it was, frankly, just the opportunity to get all the various elements together for the launch plan. But we think it is quite representative of the growth opportunity that we see in a number of our emerging markets.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then 2Q gross margin came in I guess a little below what we had been modeling. I realize there was less of a benefit from mark-to-market, but I think gross margin comps do get tougher in the back half. And I know this is supposed to be a very big year with respect to supply chain efforts, and we're seeing some of that come through. So I guess is 2Q the way we should be thinking about gross margin expansion for the next few quarters, or are we likely to see the rate of year-over-year change for gross margin improve moving forward?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Look, I guess, Andrew, I would say if you look at the quarter, maybe I'd start with year-to-date gross margins up 150 basis points ex-mark-to-market, the quarter ex-mark-to-market up 70 basis points. Developed markets have been very strong on gross margins. I think in the quarter, you would have seen some challenges in terms of keeping up with currency-driven inflation in a couple markets. Brazil is a good example. EEMEA is a bit of a challenge in terms of volume leverage. So I would tell you, as we've said and as we shared in the conferences, this is going to be primarily a gross margin driven continued margin expansion. The supply chain work that we're doing is still significant. We feel great about that. The net productivity was very strong. And I think gross margin will continue to be a driver of the margin expansion for us.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. Brian, I guess I wanted to ask first about your revenue management efforts. My sense is that you're still in the relatively early stages of analyzing and starting to unlock some of those efficiencies. So as you talked today about the need to reinvest back into trade in the U.S. and a few other markets, should we really expect trade optimization to have a meaningful impact on price\/mix dynamics or margins this year, or is it something that you're looking at over more of a multiyear timeframe?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I wouldn't really change anything from what we've said. It continues to be a large spend for us and a big opportunity. We've mobilized resources and analytically are better understanding our trade spend now on a global basis. And I would say we continue to look for opportunities to more effectively manage that spend. In some cases, it's going to allow us to reinvest those dollars in important markets where we think that's necessary to drive growth and good margins. Really for us, it's about balancing share and customer relationships and margins, and that's going to be an important part of how we manage the overall growth of the business and the margins of the business. So nothing's really changed in terms of what we're doing. The activity and the initiative is on track. And I think you'll always see us selectively reinvest trade spend where we have to where we think that's a prudent decision with good ROI.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks, Brian, and just one follow-up on the organic sales trends in Eastern Europe. You mentioned some newer issues emerging in the Middle East and North Africa. I was just wondering if the impact from those was amplified by the seasonal timing in the quarter or a difficult comparison. And going forward into the second half of the year, would you expect the region broadly to return to some level of positive organic sales growth?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would say not a lot of seasonality in that. It's more the macro dynamics in oil prices, political instability. You can go right down the list. Clearly, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Yemen, Syria, those are markets that are challenging, and I would say just consumer demand was down and categories have been down. So we do see some signs of stabilization as we look to the second half of the year. And as we talked about, the other elements of that business, Eastern Europe, Russia has done very well, and there are parts of Africa that have also done well. So we'll manage it. I think it's one of the reasons why you saw us take down the overall view on revenue for the total year is that instability and that volatility.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Probably the only seasonality that does have an impact is Ramadan in the Mideast. And it was a slow Ramadan season in large measure, as Brian said, because of the macro environment, driven by low oil prices. And that's volume that just doesn't come back. But net-net, our outlook for a number of the other countries is to see continued momentum.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you both.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thanks for the question. I think this is the second quarter in a row where you've said that you're increasing A&C support. But I'm having a little trouble understanding quantifying that and then figuring it out as a percentage of sales. Is it going up? Because \u2013 and then you also said you're increasing trade promotion in certain areas. So just in terms \u2013 maybe I could break it out this way. Internally, are you telling the organization that you're putting more money into marketing than you thought in the beginning of the year, like consumer marketing, and at the same time also more into trade promotion simultaneously? Thanks.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I guess, Rob, it varies a little bit by market. But I think overall we are getting good returns on the A&C investment, and that's why we continue to make those investments. Our A&C is above 9% of revenue. You won't have visibility to that right now, but we continue to see A&C as a critical driver of our brand equities. And certainly as you start to see the recovery in places like the UK, Germany, India, Australia, EU biscuits, it's all reflective of the investments that we're making. And so those are the kinds of places that we will continue to make investments as well as in digital marketing.","That said, there are selected hot spots that we've talked about, particularly markets like U.S. biscuit and Brazil where our price gaps are not where we want them to be. And so we are going to invest some trade back in that business, but that's not going to be without A&C support to continue to drive the longer-term brand equity. So net-net, we are increasing A&C in those places where we feel we're getting an adequate return, and that's an important part of our algorithm going forward.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. As a follow-up on that trade promotion question and also throwing in SKU rationalization, can you provide any specific examples of changes that you've been making? And have your expectations around trade promotion spending changed for this year given the competitive environment you just laid out?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","For sure, David. I think the reality is we are seeing a little bit different environment where not only we're a bit weaker in terms of category growth in some markets, but seeing how competitors play. And a couple examples we called out in the discussion are North American biscuits and Brazil, where we've seen more aggressive competitive trade spend that's affected our shares and our growth. So that's clearly a place where we're redeploying trade spend. And I would say we're finding, to the first part of your question, we are finding opportunities to free up some dollars in other trade spending we do across the business and realign it in those markets, which is going to be important given the environment that we're seeing.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Are there any specific examples that you can cite in terms of bigger buckets that have changed with regard to trade promo spending and SKU rationalization?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","SKU rationalization has been ongoing. That's a contributor as much to what we're doing on net productivity and supply chain reinvention. So without getting into specific details on where we might be cutting trade spend or specific accounts, I'm not going to probably get into that.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. I wanted to circle back to Rob Moskow's question in terms of A&C spend. Can you give us the specifics in terms of what advertising within SG&A has done year to date and what your expectation is for the full year?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jason, we'll give you that number at the end of the year as we always do in our 10-K. But again, advertising is an important component of our overall brand equities. We will continue to look to make sure that our share of voice and share of market are well aligned. And I've been very clear about where the key markets are where we're making those investments. But we will continue to monitor the returns that we're getting on those investments, both near term as well as over the longer term.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay; let me try another one then. Let's talk price real quick. I appreciate that vol\/mix has gotten better. Comparisons certainly are more favorable going forward. But price is sliding a little bit. It sounds like the trajectory on the forward is even weaker, which isn't inconsistent with what we're hearing from other companies. Is that consistent, though, with how you're looking at the world right now?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, covering costs with our pricing is critical to our algorithm, as you know. And so it is our intent to continue to price to offset higher input costs, particularly those that are common to industry. And currency in particular continues to be a headwind for us in most markets around the world. And so the key for us as we think about protecting gross margins as well as continuing to drive our ability to invest in our brands, making sure that we have adequate coverage of our cost is critically important.","As the market leader, we typically are the first to increase prices. It does often lead to some temporary dislocation, but it ultimately recovers. I talked a lot about \u2013 last year I talked a lot about our share position in chocolate in general, but particularly in markets like the UK and Germany. It took some time for the consumers to adjust to those new price points. And now we're starting to see our shares recover. So there's no question there's some short-term dislocation, but our ability to cover costs with our pricing is critical to our overall algorithm.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it; very good.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","2016, as we've said to you, pricing will be less of a factor than it has been in the past years, but we still do see a couple of the emerging market economies that are going to require that we continue to price.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes, yes. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great, thank you and good morning.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Brian, just a minor, minor thing -- apologies here. You said $0.08 on the FX impact. I think your slide actually says minus $0.09. Did you just misspeak, or is it \u2013 which one is it, $0.08 or $0.09?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's $0.08, and if the slide is wrong we'll get it fixed.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","No worries; it's minor. Just want to make sure I'm writing the right things here.","The big picture, I'd just like to go back to the capital allocation and just at least give it a try, see what you think of this question. But if the margin upside is as good as laid out and if there is more to come after 2018, why not just take the capital and buy back stock and execute the margin improvement program? Wouldn't a large acquisition require the sale of equity, which is presumably under-earning right now?","And then I just want to say, Irene, that I'm really trying to make this not a Hershey question, and I totally understand your sensitivity. I'm really trying to focus on the margin potential side of this and how big is that margin potential over time. And then lastly, I'd just note this builds on the big margin changes that we've seen at the peers with some announcement for bigger margin expectation having just gotten rolled out. So it's incredibly topical. Thank you.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, David, we really believe our point of difference versus other companies is our ability to grow on both the top and the bottom line. We have an advantaged set of assets both in terms of our brand portfolio, our routes to market, as well as in our overall geographic footprint. And we will continue to invest in those assets to drive long-term growth.","In the near term and frankly over the longer term, the funding source for those investments will come from continued margin expansion. And as you rightly point out, we see opportunity, as you've heard from us this morning. We continue to see opportunities to deliver margins in the 17% to 18% range in 2018, and certainly we will continue to see opportunities beyond that. So margin remains the source of expansion to the bottom line as well as a source of funding for us to continue to invest in our brand franchises. Even as our global categories have slowed, snacking categories are growing at a much faster rate than other food, and we continue to see the long-term potential of investing in that growth opportunity.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay; I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein Research.","Matt Romariz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Matt Romariz standing in for Alexia. Good morning. Thanks for the question. And I was just wondering if you could give us a brief update on your China business. You mentioned the initiative of launching chocolate there now. Basically, it's broad-sized within the APAC segment. Is its profitability broadly in line with the segment profitability we see? Just general color in the China business would be nice. Thank you.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","China is an important market for us. We have some of the most attractive gross margins in that market of any of the emerging markets in the world. But there's no question that the economy has weakened, and that's contributed to slower growth of our categories. And so we have continued to selectively invest in marketing support in our power brands and in particular in e-commerce, as the fastest growth in e-commerce is occurring in China. And we actually see close to 10% of snacks being purchased online, and it's one of the drivers of the partnership that we struck with Alibaba.","So we really believe that strong programming we have on our core franchises, biscuit and gum, together with the launch of China will help us to continue the momentum in that market. But near term, we do remain cautious, given the economy. But there's no question as we look at the long-term profile, the growing middle class, the urbanization of the population, and the opportunity for continued distribution gains, China will continue to be an important part of the growth story.","Matt Romariz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","But any ballpark numbers for profitability that you can share?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We are not providing profitability by country.","Matt Romariz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right.

Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, John. Are you with us, John? We lost you.","Operator","Okay, he may have got disconnected.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you hear me?","Operator","Okay, John. Go ahead.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm sorry, sorry about that. I'd like to ask about the power brands and that the rate of growth there has really moderated from solid mid-single digits the last two years down to 3% this quarter. Can you walk through what's behind that deceleration? And maybe specifically the extent that you've already realized some of the easier distribution gains, and now it's just a slower build going forward, or is it really just tied back to biscuits and the macro issues in general?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say it's the latter, John. There's no question that if you think about our overall share performance, we're only down 0.3 points of share in the U.S. biscuit. But given the size of that market, it has a profound impact on our overall performance. And so there's no question that getting that U.S. biscuit business back growing again more significantly is a critical piece of our overall performance. But our power brands will continue to be the growth drivers of our overall portfolio. They carry higher margins. They grow at a faster rate. And we expect that we are now over time continuing to put them on advantaged assets through the work we're doing in supply chain reinvention. And so the Q2 numbers were largely impacted by the U.S. biscuit situation.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And there are big power brand exposures in some of the emerging markets that have slowed, John, so it's really the macro.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But the white space opportunity is still just as strong as it's been going forward?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, absolutely.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Ken.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Ken.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I have two sizing questions in terms of the new markets. When you think about China and the chocolate market, you said that gum is growing to about a $200 million business over a four-year period. Is that the right metric to think about it and how big this white space opportunity is? Is it bigger than that? Can you just size the opportunity for us?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not going to give you our business proposition. But again, we see it as a very attractive market. And frankly the opportunity, many of the players in that market have not performed particularly well of late, and so we see it as a real opportunity for us to take some leadership and get the category growing faster.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, all right. And then the second question that I have is when you think about the online business, I think you said $1 billion in 2020. Is that all incremental? Does that take away other business? How much of that do we actually think of as truly new business? Is there a way to parse that out as well?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Obviously, it's early days, Ken, and so I think it's hard to tell you exactly how incremental it is as consumers shift their behavior from more traditional channels. It's not going to be 100% incremental. But there's no question that we have the opportunity as we look at the kinds of items were offering in those channels as well as the nature of the consumption occasions that the consumer is using those channels for, be it gifting or subscription opportunities, that clearly will be incremental to our base business. And so it's one of the reasons we're so encouraged about that opportunity and have chosen to invest significantly behind it.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I guess what I'm trying to get at is I understand that this year is a little bit weaker in terms of sales growth relative to your long-term expectations. But are there other legs to the stool like these that you expect to see acceleration? Is that the way to think about it? Is that how you see white space opportunities in these growth algorithms, and that's how you're going to get back to that higher level of growth? Is that the way to think about it?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the opportunity is both white space in terms of our category participation as well as our channel participation. As we look at emerging markets, for example, we still see growth in the traditional trade. And so part of our investment in route-to-market in areas like Brazil or India or even China as we think about getting outside the main cities is designed to access those consumers and that consumption that we don't cover with our participation in the modern trade. So it's both white space with respect to brands and innovation opportunities as well as with respect to channel.","Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great, I really appreciate it. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Good morning, thanks for getting me in, just a couple quick ones. First, if you look at what Hershey did recently in China, it actually extends the milk chocolate Hershey brand to a lot of different places. They've recently had to significantly retrench their growth expectations. So looking at that and maybe how much penetration and competition there is in the chocolate business, what it is about Milka that makes you think it's a good time right now to launch in China?","And secondly, if I can, what is it about just this fascinating 10% or so of snacks being bought in China via e-commerce? What is it that's going on in that market that makes that consumer want to buy snacks through your Alibaba partnership, e-commerce in general? And can you bring that to North America, to Latin America, other markets in a way where Mondel\u0113z can well outpunch the competition in that channel? Thanks very much.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Jon, let me answer the second question first, which is absolutely we see the opportunity. There's no question. There are different models within e-commerce. Alibaba is much more of a single-item model versus some of the models that we see with some of our traditional retailers in the developed markets that are more just a market basket approach to a way to buy their normal purchases. So we see every opportunity to learn from the experience we're having with Alibaba and bring some of the unique items, some of the subscription opportunities for brands like belVita, for example, to the online space and to drive our growth. And that is the big opportunity that we see. We are certainly learning a lot from the various partnerships that we have around the world.","With respect to chocolate in China, we have studied this for quite some time. The Chinese consumers love brands with personality. We've done a lot of testing with the consumer, and our Milka bundle is a very unique bundle. The purity of Alpine milk together with some of the assets that you're familiar with, the Lila cow, for example, are really positive with the Chinese consumer. And we have every expectation that we can actually bring growth back to this market with the launch of Milka.","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great, thanks very much.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jonathan.","Operator","Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's conference call.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead sir.","Shep Dunlap","Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website mondelezinternational.com\/investors.","During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","As we discuss our results today, unless otherwise noted, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant-currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","In today's call Dirk will give you an overview of our results as well as progress update against our strategic priorities, then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We'll close with Q&A.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon, everybody. Today, we're reporting strong second quarter results as our category leadership position and solid execution allows us to capitalize on strong snacking fundamentals in most of our key markets.","Our first half performance demonstrates that our more consumer-centric approach and focus on our strategic priorities is working. We're delivering volume-driven topline growth, while driving earnings growth and improved cash flow generation. Given this performance we're raising our full year outlook for organic net revenue growth to 3% plus which Luca will discuss in more detail later in the call.","As you can see on my first slide, it is clear that our unique position as a global snacking leader and our unique approach to growing our business is driving us forward. We have a strong portfolio of global and local brands combined with an advantaged manufacturing and distribution network.","We have leading positions in both developed and emerging markets and we have talented and committed colleagues who are energized by the progress they are seeing. The combination of these advantages are helping to generate volume growth, which by virtue of our efficient operations, generates more fuel to further invest in expanding our topline as well as create long-term value for our shareholders.","We create that value through our consumer-centric growth strategy a reminder of which is on Slide 5. Our long-term goal is to deliver attractive dollar profit increase driven by solid topline growth as well as free cash flow expansion by focusing our business on three clear priorities; first to accelerate topline growth, second to drive operational excellence, and third to build a winning growth culture.","Turning to the financial results for the second quarter on the next slide. We delivered strong performance against many key metrics. Our topline growth accelerated to 4.6% underpinned by solid category performance improving share trends and volume growth.","Our emerging markets grew 7.6% while developed markets showed 2.8% growth. Our adjusted operating income grew in line with revenue as volume leverage and cost savings were partly reinvested in strengthening our brands and capabilities for the future.","We reported high single-digit adjusted EPS growth and free cash flow reached $581 million since the start of the year. We also continued to make great progress on living our purpose across the organization including through our sustainability agenda.","To talk briefly about our geographies, revenue grew across all four of our regions and was underpinned by market share gains. Our North American business grew 2.5% led by strong U.S. Biscuits result. Our AMEA business grew 4.7% overall with strong growth in China and India. Our European business grew 3.9% boosted by the U.K., Germany, and Russia. And in Latin America, growth was 10.9% or 4.2% excluding Argentina.","Let me share a little more detail on progress against our strategy turning to Slide 7. We committed to increasing and optimizing investment behind our brands both global and local and our channels in order to create a solid foundation for future growth.","Year-to-date, we have driven a total increase in organic net revenue of over $500 million and an increase in adjusted operating income of almost $100 million on a constant-currency basis.","This investment is helping us to maintain strong growth momentum in two of our biggest brands Oreo and Cadbury Dairy Milk, thanks in part to expansion of distribution in key markets and channels.","At the same time, we are putting more emphasis than in the past on our local jewels. For example Nutter Butter, an iconic U.S. brand that celebrated its 50th anniversary this year is delivering double-digit growth thanks to fresh investments.","We're also fueling channel expansion. We have continued to expand our rural distribution network in major markets like India. This will give us an even stronger competitive advantage in a market where we're already leaders.","In Southeast Asia, further investment in modern and traditional trade has enabled us to accelerate our fast-growing chocolate business in countries like Indonesia resulting in double-digit growth and share gains. We continue to build our e-commerce business as well. Our global e-commerce reported net revenue grew more than 30% in the quarter, while our U.S. e-commerce business grew almost 80%. We also saw continued strong growth in markets like China, where partnerships with e-tailers are helping us gain share.","Operational excellence remains critical to our success. I was particularly pleased to see our Easter execution this year. During a particularly important time for our chocolate business, we achieved best-in-class service levels in key markets across Europe. And when it comes to cost, we are continuing to exercise the muscle we've built over recent years.","Cost discipline remains well embedded in our organization, thanks to zero-based budgeting and we are extending efforts to cut other unnecessary costs from our supply chain, including reducing waste in our U.S. manufacturing network. As we head into the second half of the year, our new commercial organization is operating well.","Our focus is more local and increasingly consumer-centric leading to improved speed, execution and results. By way of example in changing our organizational structure in Europe, we've made our business planning process much more efficient with 40% fewer meetings required. This has increased the speed of decision-making and keeps our people focused on their growth initiatives.","On the next slide, I want to talk about another important pillar of our growth strategy, the acquisition of brands that help us accelerate growth by entering -- excuse me -- into adjacencies in broader snacking or into more well-being oriented products. So far this year, we've already made investments through our SnackFutures unit in the paleo\/vegan chocolate company Hu and in the prebiotics company Uplift Foods.","As you will have seen, we've recently taken a majority stake in Perfect Snacks, the pioneer in refrigerated nutrition bars. A few reasons why we are so excited about this brand. The products have great well-being credentials and offer organic non-GMO protein-rich snacks, which are on-trend with consumers. The company is growing fast and had 2018 revenues of $70 million.","We will operate Perfect Snacks as a separate business in order to nurture its culture and its spirit. And importantly, key members of the founding family, the Keith are keeping a significant minority stake and will continue to lead the company. While they remain a separate business, we will offer significant resources to expand distribution. The business is delivering very strong growth and we're excited about the potential with clear opportunities to expand this platform further.","Finally, let's turn to our impact on the world around us and our consumers. Our company's purpose to empower consumers to snack right is also reflected in our broad corporate sustainability agenda. In the second quarter, we announced our sustainable and mindful snacking goals.","As part of our sustainable snacking strategy, for example, we have committed to sourcing 100% of the cocoa for our chocolate through Cocoa Life and moving to 100% recyclable packaging by 2025. And in order to encourage mindful consumption by our consumers, we will include portion amounts and mindful snacking information on all packages globally by 2025.","We're also committed to cutting carbon dioxide emissions from the energy used in manufacturing. To help us achieve that, we announced a partnership with Enel Green Power to purchase energy delivered through the grid from a solar energy farm in the U.S. This will help us reduce our global manufacturing emissions by around 5%. The feedback on these initiatives from consumers and governments have been positive and underscores the importance for us to continue to lead the way in creating a future, where people and the planet thrive.","With that, I will hand over to Luca.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. As you can see on slide 11, we delivered strong performance across all our key metrics. The quarter includes broad-based revenue growth with balanced volume\/mix and pricing, a solid increase in gross profit and high single EPS growth. Productivity and overhead savings provided the fuel for $50 million of business investments in the first half versus last year to drive sustainable growth. Finally, these good results translated into free cash flow of approximately $600 million year-to-date.","Turning to slide 12. Our leading footprint in emerging markets remains a competitive advantage for us and help drive our strong topline growth in Q2. These markets grew approximately 8%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth greater than 5%. Excluding inflation-driven growth in Argentina, emerging markets grew 5.4%.","China, India, Southeast Asia, Russia and Mexico were among some of our business units that drove this growth with a nice balance of volume and price. Developed markets also posted good momentum in Q2 with nearly 3% organic net revenue growth, driven by strong results out of Europe and notable improvement in North America.","Now let's review our profit performance on slide 13. In the second quarter, we increased gross profit by more than 4%. Productivity, volume leverage and pricing all contributed. And importantly, gross profit grew faster than revenues in three of four regions. We feel very good about our ability to convert additional volume and revenue into gross profit and investing this benefit to ignite a virtuous cycle.","In Q2, this benefit was partially muted by some operational issues we've had in Brazil. I'll talk a bit more about those in a minute. Our gross profit increase translated into solid OI dollar expansion with volume leverage and cost savings offsetting a step up in investments in the areas of A&C route-to-market and innovation.","Moving to regional performance on slide 14. Europe delivered an excellent quarter with 3.9% revenue growth, driven by strength in the U.K., Germany and Eastern Europe. Notably, strong in-store execution and marketing activations around Easter enabled a halo effect on our chocolate business and allowed us to exceed our sales expectations and gain market share while driving the category. Philadelphia also performed particularly well as our investments are driving growth.","Adjusted OI dollars grew by 5% in Europe due to robust sales and volume leverage alongside ongoing cost discipline. We also invested in A&C and route-to-market in the quarter. AMEA grew 4.7% due to continued strength across much of the region. India delivered another quarter of double-digit growth fueled by strong market dynamics and great execution in both Chocolate and Biscuit.","China grew double-digits driven by strong results in Biscuit. This includes a balance between global and local trends as both Oreo and Pacific delivered great results. Gum also had a standout quarter with strong growth as we continue to take share. South East Asia grew mid single-digits with solid results in Biscuits and Chocolate. AMEA increased operating income dollars by 5% due to operating gains, partially offset by additional investments in high-growth potential markets.","Latin America grew 10.9% due in part to inflation-driven growth in Argentina and impact of lapping the trucker strike in Brazil last year. Growth excluding these items was low single-digits. Mexico delivered another mid single-digit increase driven by Graham. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined by approximately 13%, primarily due to issues in Brazil during the quarter, surrounding the consolidation of four plants to two.","Production delays and some service delivery issues impacted our gross profit. Our team in Brazil is working to address these issues and we expect improvements over the course of the second half, although there will be some headwinds also for Q3. Finally, North America grew 2.5% in Q2 led by solid results in the U.S. Biscuits business. We gained share in Biscuits as Oreo and belVita delivered strong results across multiple channels.","We continue to improve service levels and in addition, our DSD execution is driving benefits. While we still have work to do to improve consistency, we are encouraged by this progress. The North American region grew OI by nearly 10% due to effective pricing, waste reduction and overall supply chain execution.","Let me spend a moment on category highlights. Our three snacking categories continued to demonstrate great fundamentals with total category growth of 3.4% on a year-to-date basis. This builds off 2018 momentum and reinforces our confidence that we have shaped the portfolio in the right way to benefit from attractive categories and markets. We also know that in many cases, we have helped drive this category's strength through our investments and execution.","A few examples include, U.S. Biscuits where Oreo and DSD are two key drivers or Easter execution around the world, but especially in the U.K. and Australia or in India where our distribution gains are helping chocolate to make its way into consumption habits throughout the country. Overall, we held or gained share in 65% of our business, which is an improvement over recent quarters.","Our Biscuits business grew 3.6%. Approximately 70% of our revenue grew or held share in this category including our U.S., China and India business. In Chocolate, our business grew 6.6%. Approximately 65% of our revenue grew or held share including the U.K., Australia and Brazil. The execution around this season in many of our key chocolate countries was best-in-class. Gum & Candy revenue grew slightly. About 35% of our revenue in this business gained or held share including strength in China gum and Mexico candy.","Now turning to EPS on slide 20. Q2 EPS grew 9%. This growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results as well as income from the JV equity investment and share repurchases. I'll now move on to our cash flow results on slide 21. We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of $581 million in line with our plans due to further working capital efficiencies. We are well positioned to deliver on our full year target.","Turning to capital deployment on the next slide, we have returned $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first half. Today, we announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend of 10% consistent with our goal of dividend growth in excess of adjusted EPS.","Moving to our outlook. We are increasing our full year organic net revenue growth expectations to 3% plus. This reflects our strong first half results, as well as our view that the fundamentals around our categories remain robust and that momentum will continue into the second half. But it also acknowledges that our year-to-date revenues, was positively affected by an exceptional execution in our Easter season. We are also increasing our outlook for EPS growth to approximately 5%.","Let me spend a few words to explain some of the dynamics here. Our EPS delivery in the first half has been strong, but with respect to the second half, it is important to note that we lack two items. The first one is a tax favorability in Q3 last year related to the U.S. tax reform transition period. And the second is impact of lower tax rates in the Netherlands that benefited JDE in Q4 2018. Excluding these two items, our underlying profit performance should be comparable with the first half, where volume leverage upsides and gross profit increases will be partially reinvested in growth initiatives.","Concerning our overall second half effective tax rate, it is important to note that it is expected to be in line with Q2. We are also updating our interest expense estimate to approximately $400 million. Additional geopolitical disruptions or other disruptive events including Brexit are not anticipated within this EPS outlook estimate. Finally, our free cash flow expectations are unchanged.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Good afternoon, everyone. Just two questions from me.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Good afternoon. First, I guess just at a high level Dirk, with the strong first half curious where you see this as putting Mondelez in the scheme of its broader strategy? I guess, do you see the company as ahead of schedule to return to the stated long-term algorithm? And then second, guidance for 3% plus organic top line for the full year. As you mentioned, Luca suggested deceleration from call it the 4% level in the first half. Are there some discrete items to think through here particularly given category growth is running above 3%? Or is there also perhaps some conservatism being employed as well? Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Thanks for the question, Andrew. I will maybe reply to the first part and then Luca can take the second question. So yes, we are pleased with the performance in the first half. We feel that it's a confirmation of the strong fundamentals that we have, which as you see with our unique position as a global snacking leader, within the right categories, within the right geographies. We have the emerging markets, but also developed markets this quarter doing quite well. We feel that we are successfully executing against our strategy, which is good \u2013 giving good early results and share trends.","We wanted to invest in our brands and our capability, which we are doing, and which we can probably increase a little bit for the year. And we know that that's not linear. Not all of the effects of that increased investment we will see this year. That's going to build up over time. And then, the whole change we want to drive in the company becoming more consumer-centric. We've changed our structure to business units, with a local-first approach changed the incentives all to improve speed and execution and results.","And yes, I would say that, at this stage we feel that everything is going as planned and probably faster than we would have planned. And we feel that, the strategy we put in place and our execution against that strategy is positioning us in a situation where we think that creating sustainable long-term shareholder value is clear. And yeah, we feel pretty good about what's happening in the company at this stage. So maybe Luca, you can talk about the guidance?","Luca Zaramella","Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. I think when you look at the quality of the overall results it is I think fair to say that, probably all around this is one of the best, if not the best quarter since the formation of Mondelez. And clearly, that gives us the confidence in the outlook also going forward. So we remain quite optimistic on the outlook and we clearly anticipate, continued momentum in the second half. We have to acknowledge though that the first half was positively impacted by what we call the halo effect on a great Easter execution.","As we look around, all the countries where we have a meaningful chocolate business and there are many. We clearly drove the category performance in Q2. And we have executed very well from I would say supply chain with the exception of Brazil which we called out as one exception to actually being able to sell in the marketplace not only our seasonal products, but also the regular lines. And as we look at Easter, we are very, very pleased. We did exceptionally well. And that is one of the reasons why maybe the second part of the year might be lower than the 4% growth rate that you have seen in the first half. But to be very precise, we didn't have any discrete items in Q2 for that matter in the first half. Yes, we are lapping the trucker strike last year in Brazil, but in the big scheme of things it's quite immaterial. It is 0.1 points of growth for total Mondelez.","You didn't ask about profit, but maybe I'll spend a couple of words there as well. Again, we are very pleased with what we saw on the first half. Excluding Brazil, gross profit is really growing nicely and we see the virtuous cycle coming to fruition. We see volume leverage coming through, productivity effective pricing. I mean, look at the number we are posting for North America profit as one example. And we are using the upside to reinvest in the business.","The second half, as far as profit goes, it will be comparable to what we have seen so far. But we also want to solidify our business through continued investment.","And so there is a little bit more to come in terms of investments. And clearly, where we see momentum, may be will double down to make sure that we generate even more revenue.","So may be, we are conservative. But I would say the, first half was exceptionally well as we executed around for instance, these drivers I called out.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good afternoon, everyone.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","So two questions for me, one just -- first one, in North America pricing was up a little bit more sequentially in the second quarter, than it was in the first quarter. And I think you said in the prepared remarks, that you also had share gains.","So, I guess two things around that. Relative to this price increase that you took earlier in the year or late last year, has the share performance. And the brands responded to that pricing. May be better than you expected?","And I guess, as we are thinking about, kind of the balance of the year, would you expect that level of pricing to hold up the balance of the year?","Luca Zaramella","Yeah. Maybe I'll start. And then, to give a little bit of more perspective on shares and brand dynamics, so I think that we led color -- a little bit of color there. So pricing, yes, it is sequentially better.","And by the way, I think if you look across all the regions, it is a little bit sequentially better. So, it's not only a North American thing, I would say. But we announced price the second way, quite frankly, towards the end of last year and became partially into effect in Q1.","So, it is kicking in, at its fullest in Q2. And that's why you see -- you see the benefit. Becoming a little bit more pronounced in Q2. As you said, the categories particularly in Biscuits are reacting well.","When you dissect the category dynamics you see both, volume and pricing, being positive. And so, not really true that you can price and you're going to lose volume EPU.","If you have good marketing bumbles. And f you support your franchises, that can lead to value and volume growth simultaneously, which is the case. And on top of that, we are driving share.","Dirk Van de Put","Yeah. And may be to add to that on the shares, so, yes, we are seeing that our Biscuits category is in very good shape. North America, and as you know, it's 80% of our business.","We have outstanding results for brands like Oreo or belVita, which means that we are driving the category growth. We see the pricing come through as Luca was commenting, and as we are gaining share.","We also are seeing clearly that we have the benefit now of DSD. We have excellent execution in DSD in this quarter. And the other thing that has been changing is the retailer de-stocking is slowing down.","So overall, we feel that there is good momentum in the consumer -- or in the consumption of our brands. And we feel that this momentum is going to continue. May be on North America, which has been a discussion in the past, a little bit on the supply chain because that could throw us off on those share gains that I was talking about.","We saw a very good quarter. We are lowering our waste. Our case fill rate is back to a reasonable level. There's more work to be done. But overall, we feel that we really are seeing good progress there.","We also have to improve our predictability and the consistency of the supply-chain. That has been one of the issues. But again, now for a number of quarters that has been improved.","And we are also focused overall in driving excellence in our core operating processes. So, we don't see anything in the internal functioning of the company that would throw us off to continue to gain share in North America.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. Thanks for that. And Luca, if I could just follow-up on, net interest expense. It's down for the year versus original. Is that a function of like refinancing or a movement in rates? Just trying to understand if there's more sensitivity to that, as we look forward?","Luca Zaramella","No. I don't think. I mean you probably -- and some of your colleagues in Q1. Year-to-date we are $180 million give or take in terms of interest cost. So I think it is going to be in the ballpark of $400 million. So, I think it was a little bit more of we wanted to be on the safe side.","I think in the meantime interest cost have moved down. And particularly given the commercial paper program, we have we are capturing some benefit versus the original guidance. So, I don't see anything material changing in the interest environment going forward.","And we will continue to do what we had done so far, which is really getting our interest cost over the last five years down to a very good level, considering the investment grade we have.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Bryan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi. Good evening.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, good evening, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. Thank you. I just had a question for you, first off on just the broader level of investment you're putting behind the business. And as we think about -- you gave some a good kind of forecast for the second half for profitability.","And then unique factors to keep in mind, as you've outperformed, the first half are your investments even heavier the second half than they were in the first half, is the question?","And then just to understand, how they're going emerging markets versus developed markets just to get a better sense of that please?","Dirk Van de Put","Yeah. So, we are trying to get ourselves into this virtuous cycle, whereby, we invest more and that investment is concentrated in three areas. One is A&C, the second one is route-to-market and the third one is R&D.","And as we invest more, we want that to generate volume growth, together with some pricing. And that then, increases our gross profit dollars of which we reinvest part of it. And the other part flows down to the bottom-line.","In 2019, our thinking here is to largely reinvest most of that gross profit in the business. We obviously are going to deliver on the OI increase we have for the year. But it -- this is really a year of trying to get momentum in our brands and protect them for the long-term. So if we have the opportunity in the second half, yes, we are planning to invest more.","I would also like to say that it's not just a question of investments. What we are also doing is trying to optimize our spending. What that means is that we are paying a lot of attention to our ROI on our investment activities. We've implemented a new, what we call marketing playbook, which is working well for us. And we are also shifting more of the investment to working media. So the net effect of what we really are spending on media and online is more than the extra amount we are investing. It's a shift within that spending too.","So the long answer to your question is, yes, we will -- we see this year as an investment. We are still growing our OI, but we want to catch as much as momentum as we can on our brands. And so with what we're seeing coming out in the next second half, we expect that we can do a little bit more.","As it relates to emerging markets versus developed markets, I'd say at a high level what is happening is that the very good trend that we've seen in the emerging markets, which was now for the fourth quarter in a row were growth of above 5% continued. They were up 7.6%. And we have very good results in places like India, China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe.","At this stage, we feel very good about these markets and we feel that we can continue to drive category development through increased distribution and more investment in the brands.","Probably the biggest change came from developed markets versus the previous trend in this quarter, whereby, they now grew 2.8% almost 3%. That was driven, obviously, by the continued improvement in North America and a very strong Easter season in the U.K. and Ireland.","So what I would say a good balance of volume and pricing was also clear for us in the developed markets and we expect -- we also saw as expanding our margins in those markets this quarter.","So, overall, I would say very positive signs in both and nothing at this on the horizon that would throw us off except maybe from a Brexit or something like that. But we see the momentum in emerging and developed markets continuing.","Chris Growe","Okay thank you for that answer. There was a lot of good color. I just had a quick follow-on, which is in relation to the pricing that you achieved this quarter, would you -- could we call that a full run rate based on what you announced so far? Or is there more pricing still to come through that you've announced in the market rather than focus on something you may still announce for the business?","Luca Zaramella","Look I think Chris the -- I'm sensitive while talking about future pricing actions, and I don't want to signal anything. Just remember that we had some incremental pricing actions that took effect in the second part of last year. And in general terms what I would say is we have proven that we want to be disciplined in terms of pricing. Last year in the U.S., I think we were the first player to really move.","So we will continue to be disciplined on pricing. We believe it is quintessential to the algorithm to support our franchises. So without talking about specifics, we see some places where there is inflation, where there is some commodity and cost pressures and we will take appropriate pricing actions as we see appropriate.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you very much.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steve Strycula","Hi good afternoon. So Luca to start off, I appreciate the color on Brazil. Was hoping to get a little bit more insight as to dimensionalizing how much of a profit drag it was to segment or total company profitability. And how do we think about the recovery rate in the back half? Specifically is this weighing on your ability to fill customer service rates? Is it causing any distribution losses in Brazil? Color there would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up for Dirk.","Luca Zaramella","Yeah. So these operational issues in the quarter adversely impacted the gross profit line by I would say $20 million to $30 million. So it was a material impact. The simple facts are over the last couple of years at least Brazil has -- as an economy suffered quite a bit and the categories where we compete lost quite a bit of volume. So we really underwent a material change in the business. And we featured in the past Curitiba, which is one of the two plants. We have one in the south and the other one in the north as being very cost competitive.","But the facts are we consolidated four plants down to these two plants and we had some executional issues. That translated first into inefficiencies in product that we had to scrap in the plant, but also in logistics related issues in terms of distribution inability to have the right product in the right place and also extra cost.","The recovery rate, it is hard to give you a specific answer there. What I would say though is I don't think we would be fully solved by the end of Q3 and there might be improvements in Q4. I feel hopeful that there will be improvements in Q4, albeit I can't tell you exactly what they will be at this point in time.","In the overall guidance we gave you, we consider all those things. And so we will provide an update clearly as we post Q3 and as we talk about Q4. But for the time being, I can't say that we would be fully solved by Q3 or Q4.","Steve Strycula","Thanks. And then for Dirk, we've seen a lot of the global multinational companies that are also showing very good organic sales growth, reinvest also back into the core business. So to the extent you had the ability to pull forward some of the investment spend that you're planning for maybe the start of early fiscal 2020 into this year. What are some of the priority country-category combinations that we can look for the business to maybe improve or may be even accelerate at the margin? Thanks.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Yes, I mean for us the emerging markets are very important. The reason being that we see that a lot of the snacking growth around the world will be coming from those markets. So for us to invest more in places like India, China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and also Brazil those are the places where we would think about.","At the same time, we do feel that we have very good momentum in North America and we have not necessarily been able to invest a lot more versus the past in North America. So we are planning also there to increase our investment. So that's the way I would describe it. It's about the emerging markets the ones I mentioned and then North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Kenneth.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Ken.","Ken Goldman","It seems -- at least it's a possibility of a hard Brexit taking place at this point. And I know you've spoken in the past about some of the preparation you've done to maybe mitigate the impact. Can you just update us on some of the steps you've taken since where do you stand with that? And I imagine it's far too difficult to have any level of certainty here but if you are any closer to being able to quantify some of the risks of a Brexit that would be helpful too?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. Well, it's difficult to speculate. I can give you an indication of what we think the possible effects are of a Brexit, but to quantify that exactly is a little bit difficult since we do not know which shape or form Brexit will take.","Having said that, the UK business is an important business for us. It's also one of our powerhouse businesses. It's a snacking powerhouse with a very strong presence in Chocolate, Biscuit and Candy. It's a market that is doing very well for us. It's very profitable and growing at a very good pace. And particularly this second quarter was a very good quarter for the UK.","Like I said it's very difficult to speculate, but there's different forms of Brexit. And if there is a hard Brexit there will certainly be implications to our business. In the short-term, we are largely talking about supply-related issues. And in Q1 as we were preparing for a potential Brexit in March, we put in motion those plans.","What does that mean? It means that we increased the level of raw materials we have in the country. We increased the number of warehousing space we have for finished products. We contract more distribution trucks and so we are ready to keep our products in distribution no matter what. We did that very well.","In fact The TRADE called our preparation one of the best if not the best preparation for a potential Brexit and we are going to put that plan back in motion. We thought it would cover us very well on the short-term potential effects of disruption in the supply chain. However, there is also a risk that there could be inflation and a currency devaluation as a consequence of Brexit and those are effects that are much more difficult for us to estimate.","And it would lead to a number of other changes that we needed to implement related to pricing, related to sourcing. Those are more of the longer-term effect. And as I said at this stage very difficult to exactly estimate what the quantitative effect will be.","We are ready to deal with these challenges as you can imagine. We are running scenarios and we are ready to implement. We do believe that over the long-term this is a very strong market. It's a business that we want to protect and we are sure that if we have to deal with any short-term or even a little bit longer-term disruption that in the end we will be back stronger than before. As you might know we have a very significant production presence in the UK and we see ourselves capable in the end to supply the UK from the UK if need to.","Ken Goldman","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good morning, folks. I guess, I'll real quick I'll just build off of Ken's question and I've got an entirely separate question. The UK government in March announced a temporary -- well some sort of proposal for temporary relief in the situation of a hard Brexit on import tariffs for up to 12 months. So that would appear to imply to most food products. Do you believe that would be applicable to your business? And could that be a powerful mitigator of any sort of near-term disruption?","Luca Zaramella","Look we did quite an extensive analysis on these. We don't believe even after a temporary period there will be material tariff impacts in our business given the structure of our imports into the country. As Dirk said, we have a material presence in the UK to start with but also given what we bought and the shape and form of what we bought we don't believe there will be material ongoing tariff at this point in time based on what we know at this point.","So I would say not only temporarily, but also in the long-term there will be most likely no material tariff impacts for us at this point in time. That's what we see. I think as Dirk said a hard Brexit will -- might hamper consumer confidence. There will be most likely an immediate currency devaluation on top of what we have seen these last couple of days. But we will also see potentially inflation running up into the countries and that might lead to a consumer situation. That might be detrimental not only to our business, but to the overall economy. So it's hard to say exactly what will happen, but that's really what we need to watch for. And that's how we want to take as a company a long-term stance making sure that we protect the business we have there which is quite a good business.","Jason English","Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. And then pivoting to my second line of question it's really around gross margins. I understand the Brazil math. It looks like it was somewhere in the magnitude of 30 to 50 basis point drag on GMs this quarter. But the lack of margin flow-through on the accelerating price growth is nonetheless a little bit surprising. Can you walk us through the puts and takes like where is productivity coming in? Where is inflation? Where is the reinvestment in product or expansion into other lower-margin verticals that could mix down? What are all those puts and takes that are holding back GMs?","Luca Zaramella","I would say -- and we are clearly not going to disclose gross margin or gross profit by region. But I can reassure you that, as I look at pretty much all P&Ls by category and business unit around the world, I can tell you that vast majority of those P&Ls make a lot of sense. You see broad-based growth and you see a nice balance of volume and pricing. The volume effect and the leverage that it provides to our supply chain is coming into effect and we see continued cost savings into costs and overheads.","In some cases, clearly there are better outcomes than in others. But overall, I would say again as I look around the world, we are quite in a good place in terms of GP growth. I think on a year-to-date basis, we are 20 bps up in total company and again, when you add back the potential impact of Brazil and the fact that in terms of pure percentage margins places like Argentina are becoming a little bit more diluted than we have seen in the past.","I think when you consider those two effects I think we can say we are quite pleased. You look at the OI growth in Q2 North America growing almost 10% OI. You look at EU and EMEA 5% after we made material investments in the A&C line. I think all-in-all, the algorithm as we envisaged in the first place is coming to fruition. It's not that we are not delivering the savings that volume leverage isn't there it is the fact that this specific quarter we had Latin America being an outlier.","Jason English","Okay. Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good evening.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, David.","David Palmer","Two quick ones for me as well. First on Chocolate, your Chocolate business was holding or gaining share. I think it was about 35% to 40% of its markets last year. And now those numbers look more like two-thirds of that business are holding or gaining share, so that's a nice improvement. Could you talk about the biggest factors that have really turned your market share trends in Chocolate around?","Luca Zaramella","Yes, yes. Well, we over-indexed in Easter and particularly in Europe. And so what you saw in the first quarter was that is kind of a normal trend in our business. Easter this year was not in the first quarter, but in the second quarter. Last year, it was in the first quarter. So you saw the difference. And in the second quarter, we had an excellent execution of Easter and that is really what is giving us the boost in the market share. So, we are now -- year-to-date we are sort of evened out and we saw some very good progress in our Chocolate market share. But it's completely due to our Easter execution.","David Palmer","Got it. And then second you've talked in the past about a more decentralized management approach and that was going to dovetail with a greater attention to and perhaps spend behind some of your regional power brands not just your global ones. Is that -- or has that shift already begun? And is that a factor in your results this year? Or is that something more of a longer curve to it?","Dirk Van de Put","No that shift has started. And so we've increased our overall investment and I would say a large chunk -- I can't put an exact percentage on it, but I would call it maybe 70%, 80% is going into those local brands. And we've seen a clear change of strength since we've started to do that. So local brands or regional brands in the past would have been negative for us. They're now positive and they have been accelerating every quarter in their growth. So the intention was there. We are executing and we're seeing the effects very, very clearly in our results.","David Palmer","And do you think that that will be continuing to go -- an area of improvement even from these levels?","Dirk Van de Put","I would expect that we still have some upside. At the moment, they are growing in line with or even slightly above the categories. But these are brands that have not received a lot of investments for years. If you take into account, we started about nine months ago really investing in them. So, we haven't even seen a full year of investment. And we're also not only increasing the investment, but we're doing a number of innovations launching a number of healthier products with cleaner ingredients and so on. So we are also renovating these brands. So, I do think that there's still a run way to increase the level of their growth.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thanks. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things, I think you said the second half you expected to be similar to the first. And were you referring to sales and operating income growth both because they're both running at around 4% ex currency? And then secondly, I'm still trying to figure out the level of investment or at least roughly. Your gross profit dollars ex currency are up 4.4% year-to-date. That's about $200 million. Is the answer something along the lines of half of that or some percentage of that? I know you don't want to give us an exact number, but I'm just trying to figure it out.","Luca Zaramella","Yes. So when I said -- when I was talking about the profile being comparable I was talking more about gross profit and NOI. We gave you the couple of items that are masking a little bit the underlying performance of our EPS and they related as I said to taxes. So I was really referring to the bottom line more than the top line.","What I said on the top line is that we clearly see momentum in the business. And we anticipate continued momentum in the second half both in terms of categories. And as one of your colleagues said, also in terms of share, we are quite pleased with what we saw in chocolate.","But having said that, the first half was positively impacted by what we call the halo effect of a great Easter execution. And that is why the second part of the year might be lower than the 4% growth rate of the first half. As it relates to the level of investments, as we said, for the year, we intend to invest give or take $150 million. I think as you -- I gave you enough elements to say how the second part of the year will look like in terms of GP and NOI growth.","And then we made the reference to what we spent in the first half. So there is more to come in the second half. But we will continue to invest both on global and local brands. We said we are investing in A&C. As Dirk said, it's not only the amount of money, it's the quality of what we are doing elevating, the emotional connections of our brands. But also in route-to-market or in route-to-market in places like India, Russia we continue to invest and we want to continue to invest.","And finally in R&D, we are also making material investments specifically around test-and-learn methodologies, agile methodologies. We gave you a few examples of things we are doing. So I think you have enough elements to understand what we are -- how Q2 -- how Q3 and Q4 will look like in terms of GP and NOI.","Robert Moskow","And just to be clear, the $150 million is the reinvestment for the total year or was that\u2026","Luca Zaramella","Yes it is. Yes it is.","Robert Moskow","Thank you. Perfect.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good evening.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, David.","David Driscoll","I appreciate you guys getting me in and I see what time we are on the hour. I guess just a couple of points. So first one is nice job on the first half of the year so far. And then I wanted to just ask a little bit about North America. The margin in the quarter I think just a little bit more than 22% segment margin. I believe that might be a record margin for North America. So given the problems that happened on the malware attack, et cetera, can you just take us up-to-date as to what really was the key driver for that margin? And would you expect that that margin has upside in the future as you continue your progression on cost in Lines of the Future, et cetera?","Luca Zaramella","Look I think, if I have to step back and really tell you what is the difference in Q2 versus other quarters in North America, it is we have created a lot of discipline around key processes for the company. Starting with demand planning, making sure that we shape up demand in a way that makes sense in terms of cost. Instead of shipping products from branch-to-branch, we are governing through a better forecast, through a better governance all those flows of goods that in a context where we have more than 50 branches and quite a few SKUs in biscuits, governing that is clearly key.","We have created a lot of discipline and visibility and transparency around waste and waste process not only what we generate in a plant, but also returns of goods. And I can tell you there is a material benefit coming through as Glen and the team have established processes to govern again waste.","And third, but not less important, it is the fact that by having visibility and good understanding of how demand is shaping, our factories are able to predict more reliably what they need to produce and when. And so we have more efficient runs in the company.","There is clearly also pricing coming through. In a context where last year we saw inflation, we priced promptly I believe. But the full benefit of pricing didn't come through last year, and so now you have a more balanced situation in terms of pricing net of cost. So these four elements are coming through.","Do I think we can improve? Absolutely. I think we can improve. As we said, North America is one of the networks where we will be making more investments going forward. And so I think in terms of upside potential there is more to come.","David Driscoll","That was a very thorough answer. One follow-on relating to outside North America, but relates to Chocolate. We've heard a number of U.S. chocolate companies taking price increases in the United States. You guys of course have in your major chocolate operations in Europe and elsewhere. Is -- can we draw any parallels between the price increases that we're seeing in the United States in chocolate where those price increases might be applicable to your chocolate operations outside the United States? Or would you really kind of disabuse me of that notion and say that these things are more unconnected than that? But it feels like North, North America and Europe should have some kind of connection in terms of chocolate pricing, would just love to hear your thought process?","Luca Zaramella","Look again, it's really \u2013 it wouldn't be good for me to comment on future pricing actions in places like Europe. Again, that is too sensitive of a subject. I think there are a couple of things though that are very clear at this point in time. One, it is that, there is quite a bit of inflation not only in the U.S. but all around the world in terms of specifically two items. It's \u2013 one it is logistics costs, and the second one is labor costs. And so I think over time we have to make sure that we price that away. Might not happen in the short-term, but over time, we have proven that we have the discipline to price those costs away.","The second part, I think it is very important to note that in terms of the way we procure cocoa, we are never hand-to-mouth. And this year for instance, cocoa prices went up for us, but we were able to secure cocoa at a very reasonable price. But I think it is fair to say that given some of the proposals that are coming out of the C\u00f4te d'ivoire and Ghana. There is a spike in cocoa cost. And concepts like the leading income differential are putting a little bit of pressure in the market. And the cost of cocoa has gone up. So I think I've given you enough elements for you to draw some conclusions. But for me to be able to talk about specific pricing actions, I think it is really hard.","David Driscoll","Really appreciate the comments. Thank you, guys.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Dickerson","Great. Thank you filling me in.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Rob.","Luca Zaramella","Hey, how are you?","Rob Dickerson","Couple of questions. I guess first question is just regarding the top line guidance you said potential implied slight deceleration, if that does happen in the back half versus kind of the floor of what we saw in the first half. The question I have though is it doesn't seem like pricing would necessarily be decelerating, just given the actions we are seeing flowing through in North America maybe Latin America as well. There's not much in Europe. But other parts of \u2013 or let's say Europe other kind of overall end market basis is still seeing decent pricing. And so then, I look at it and say well \u2013 okay, well then obviously, it will be more volume mix, and there could be some nuances to why. But like again, when I look in the first half, right, the first half the volume performance in growth terms volume\/mix was essentially similar to what we saw in the first half of last year.","And then \u2013 so if you look at the back half, the volume\/mix is a little bit easier last year to compare again. So the question, even though wordy is basically, if there is deceleration it seems like kind of what you're saying is maybe there's a little risk of nuanced volume deceleration in the back half of the year, because the first half was impacted by a well-executed Easter. It doesn't seem like pricing would decelerate, but then that's off of an easier second half compare. So like why would volumes really decelerate that much, if the compare is easier? And if pricing isn't coming down why would organic sales really decelerate? Thanks. And I have one more.","Luca Zaramella","Yeah. Look as we've said, I don't think this is about not having confidence in the second part of the year or seeing momentum slowing down or \u2013 as Andrew asked the first question having some discrete items in the first half that will turn into issues in the second part. This is nothing around all \u2013 any of these topics. Again, it is the recognition of the fact that in the 4.1%, we had on a year-to-date basis in the first half, there was a clear execution gain related to Easter.","And that is why the second part of the year might be lower than the 4%, we see in the first half. But I think in the end, we have to feel good about the solidity of our categories the fact that the growth of the business is broad-based. Again, it is not about the quarter at 4.6% that I like. Obviously, I like the 4.6%. But it is the good quality of results all around. I haven't seen these types of volume\/mix and price gains in a long, long time. I was very pleased with the share gains that we started seeing. Chocolate is fantastic. We are still losing a bit of share in places like India, where we have a 65% share. But if I take out India, all the big markets they are growing share. And the same is applicable to Biscuits. So this is not about saying the second part of the year, we will have a slowdown or it is about recognizing that in the first half, there was a positive impact due to Easter.","Rob Dickerson","Okay. Fair enough. And then one other question \u2013 I have two questions. One is a little bit more sensitive. The first question is on just your JDE piece right total income from equity investments. In the first half year-over-year, it's up, say 30%. So obviously something is going well there. If you could just provide any color as to why they've been performing so well, one. And then two is that a run rate that we should be thinking about at least in the near term for the back half? And I asked just given it's obviously material to your total income.","Luca Zaramella","Look, we are very pleased with coffee. It is fair to say that they have performed very, very well. So in Q2 and the first half, as you said, the earnings grew respectively 40% and 25%. As KDPs getting the synergies and this should be no surprise, we are reporting KDP on a lag. So to understand what is going to happen in Q3 for KDP, you have to look at their Q2. And JD is capitalizing on a successful business model in single-serve and espresso and compatible business, which is doing very, very well and it is taking share in the major markets in Europe mostly.","The company is also generating good cash flow and they are delevering fast. And so, there is a subsequent interest cost saving. So, nothing has really changed in what we see in JDE and KDP. They are good financial investments for us. They doubled in value since the inception of the JV. And as we've said many times, there is more upside potential for both businesses and we like clearly the clarity, the vision, the potential and the flexibility those investments offer.","Rob Dickerson","So, it doesn't sound like there's much urgency like say -- or any change to the strategic optionality thought process right? They're doing well. Obviously Q1 and Q2, they've done very well. Unless you really need the cash for some reason, let's just keep letting them do well. It's pretty much that?","Luca Zaramella","Yeah. I mean we have good shareholder right over both companies. Specifically for JDE, we could propose a price to drop for which they have the right of first refusal. And then if the value is not accepted, we could take JD public through an IPO. And clearly, we would love to have a public mark for both investments as we believe there is more value. So, yeah, you're right. Nothing at this point has really changed. We see more upside potential for both companies.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, super. And then one last quick one is just your -- when you said, back half profit would be similar to first half profit, means a lot of different things. And maybe I just don't get it. Sometimes I don't. Is that -- you're just -- you're literally just saying operating profit? Or is that gross profit? Or is that just net profit like net income would be similar on a dollar basis back half versus second half? That\u2019s it. Thanks.","Luca Zaramella","Yeah. I think the shape of the P&L will be similar to the first half. I would say -- I would leave it at that. Clearly there is a little bit more investment coming in the second part of the year, but broad stroke the shape of the P&L is going to be similar.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, super. Thank you so much.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you. And as I said at the outset, I'm proud of this quarter's results and of the work -- the hard work of my colleagues across the globe. I think this quarter and this first half show how our leadership position and strategy is helping to drive the strength of snacking categories around the world and creating value for our shareholders. And we do all this while remaining committed to deliver on our promise to create a future where people and the planet thrive.","This first half helps us to remain focused on our long-term objective of generating volume-driven top line growth of 3% plus and fueled by virtuous circle of increasing investments, which generate solid sustainable operating income growth. Our progress to date gives me further confidence in the validity of our strategy and our long-term prospects. Thank you for your interest in the company.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and today's slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com. As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Excuse me.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2%, as we drove our Power Brands, stepped up volume mix in developed markets, raised prices again to recover currency-driven input costs in emerging markets, and continued to eliminate less profitable brands and lower return spending. We expanded adjusted gross profit margin by 170 basis points to 39.7% by driving strong net productivity. Adjusted operating income margin expanded 240 basis points to 15.1%, as we continued to aggressively reduce overheads, while significantly stepping up A&C support. And finally, adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant-currency basis, driven by operating gains.","Let's take a closer look at the details. Organic revenue in Q1 grew just over 2%, in line with our annual guidance. Importantly, the impact from our revenue management actions, which includes SKU reduction and trade optimization, was a little more than 1 percentage point. That's largely consistent with our full-year estimate of about 1.25 points, and you'll see in a few minutes how that played through our margins. We delivered this growth despite the volatile operating and currency environment that pressured category growth, especially in many of our larger emerging markets. In aggregate, emerging markets were up about 3.5%, as we priced to recover currency-driven inflation to protect profitability. Along with softening category growth, this pricing had some elasticity impact, which resulted in lower vol\/mix in the short term.","In contrast, developed markets grew 1.3%. What's noteworthy is that nearly all of this growth was driven by vol\/mix, including solid growth in both Europe and North America. This reflects the continuation of the improvement in our vol\/mix contribution, as the cost environment has moderated since early 2015. Power Brands continued to drive our growth. They were up nearly 4%, in line with our categories. The shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter provided us with only a modest benefit, given that Easter was only one week earlier than last year.","Turning now to our results by region, despite the challenging environment, every region contributed to revenue growth, with three of them also delivering positive vol\/mix. Latin America was up nearly 4%, all due to pricing in response to currency-driven inflation in Argentina and Brazil. Brazil was down low-to-mid single digits as the deteriorating political and economic environment pressured category growth. We expect operating conditions in Brazil to remain challenging for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current outlook. In contrast, Mexico, our second largest market in the region, was a bright spot. Revenue was up high-single digits, driven by strong volume and share growth in gum.","EEMEA grew 4.5%, all driven by pricing in response to continued currency-driven inflation in several markets. Political and economic instability in several countries tempered category growth. Russia grew low-single digits, as higher pricing was mostly offset by elasticity and softer consumption due to the macro environment. Nonetheless, we held share in our two largest categories, chocolate and biscuits. As with Brazil, we remain cautious about the near-term operating environment in Russia, and that also continues to temper our full-year outlook.","Asia Pacific grew almost 3%, including about a point of vol\/mix growth. India, Australia and the Southeast Asian markets all contributed. Chocolate in India was up double digits, driven by vol\/mix gains and stable shares in response to increased A&C support behind Cadbury Dairy Milk and continued momentum of our Bubbly innovation platform. Australia was up mid-single digits, behind strength in chocolate as we lapped our significant revenue management actions from a year ago, and invest in marketing and innovation behind our now more profitable chocolate and biscuit businesses. China was essentially flat. Biscuits revenue was down, reflecting the overall category slowdown. This was offset somewhat by continued double-digit growth in gum, despite a decline in that category as well. We remain cautious about China for the remainder of the year, given the soft consumer environment and category trends.","Europe continued to show sequential improvement, delivering modest growth in the quarter, as price gaps narrowed and we selectively invested behind high ROI initiatives. Notably, Europe posted positive volume\/mix, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits, behind Power Brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and OREO.","Last but not least, North America was up about 2.5%, including a couple of points of vol\/mix growth. Biscuits grew low-single digits, largely through higher vol\/mix and share growth of OREO, belVita and Triscuit. In addition, we launched GOOD THiNS, a new biscuit innovation platform that capitalizes on consumer demand for more wholesome savory snack options. GOOD THiNS are delicious baked crackers made with potatoes, chickpeas or rice with no artificial ingredients. We launched GOOD THiNS in March, and it's already reached a 1.4 share of the U.S. cracker market.","Turning now to our categories, in the first quarter, overall category growth was about 4%. However, given the timing of Easter, retail consumption shifted somewhat from Q2 into Q1. Excluding the Easter shift impact, overall category growth was roughly 3%. Our organic growth was about a point below our categories, due primarily to our revenue management actions. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, our Power Brands grew about 4%, in line with our categories and drove significant margin expansion. Net-net, building on our Q4 momentum, about 65% of our snacks revenue gained or held share in the first quarter.","Let's look at our performance in each of our categories. Biscuits grew about 2.5%, with notable strength in the U.S. and the UK. Our share performance was also strong, with around 80% of our biscuits revenue gaining or holding share. Our biscuits Power Brands grew mid-single digits, led by OREO and belVita. In chocolate, our revenue reflected strong growth in the UK, India and Australia, as the markets adjusted to our pricing actions. This was partially offset by soft results in Brazil and Russia. Together, these two markets tempered our overall chocolate growth by more than a point and a half.","Shares were solid, with about half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share. We're pleased to see our momentum improving as price gaps narrow and our targeted investments pay off. Our performance in the UK was especially strong and a sharp turnaround from our share losses through most of 2015. We increased share by nearly a point behind increased A&C support and innovation, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Big Taste and Cadbury Dairy Milk Medley. In Germany, our share decline in the quarter was due solely to cycling the impact of the revenue management actions we implemented in the second quarter last year. As a result, this is the last quarter of impact related to those actions.","Gum & candy revenue increased almost 3%, led by strong growth of gum in Mexico and China and Sour Patch Kids candy in the U.S. About 60% of our gum & candy revenue gained or held share, with gains in Mexico, China and France.","While we remain disappointed by continued aggregate gum share declines here in the U.S, we're encouraged to see both Trident and Dentyne growing. In addition, we'll be implementing a Stride turnaround plan later this year.","To summarize, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We delivered solid top-line growth and share performance with improving vol\/mix, despite continued volatility in some of our largest emerging markets. Our solid top line, together with strong delivery of productivity and cost savings, which Brian will describe in a moment, provide a good foundation for delivering our full-year forecast.","Before I conclude, however, I'd like to pause for a moment to share a few thoughts about Mark Clouse, our Chief Commercial Officer. As you saw in today's press release, Mark will be leaving our company in a few weeks to become CEO of Pinnacle Foods. Mark is a talented executive and a natural leader who has made significant contributions to every aspect of our business over the last two decades, most recently as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has proven that he's ready for this next step in his career. We thank him and wish him and his family all the best.","While, of course, we will miss Mark, we have a deep leadership team and I'm confident that they will continue to execute flawlessly. We will take this opportunity to further simplify and streamline our organization and so we won't be backfilling the Chief Commercial Officer role. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth, despite the continued challenging environment. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points to 39.7%. Please note that this includes absorbing a 50 basis point headwind related to commodity and currency hedging contracts that don't qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Our gross margin expansion was driven by net productivity of more than 4% of COGS. That's up from about 3.5% last year and reflects continued progress as we implement integrated Lean Six Sigma and strong execution of our supply-chain reinvention program, including installing our state-of-the-art Lines of the Future around the world. In fact, we'll have four additional lines operational in our Salinas, Mexico facility by year end, complementing the seven lines already in place there.","You may have also seen that we opened our latest greenfield plant in India on Monday. This plant will produce approximately 60,000 tons of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate annually to start. By 2020, this multi-category food campus is expected to reach annual capacity of 250,000 tons.","Adjusted OI margin was 15.1%, up 240 basis points. Drivers of the improvement include the gross margin expansion, as well as overhead reductions, as we continue to drive ZBB cost savings. We did benefit from the timing of some overhead spending in the quarter that will negatively impact our second quarter, but we're fully on track to deliver our targeted cost savings related to indirect cost packages and the migration of back-office processes to global shared services. We also increased A&C support to more than 9% of revenue to support our Power Brands and drive profitable growth over the long term.","Our cost reduction efforts drove margin improvement across all of our regions with the exception of Latin America, which was affected by the tough environment in Brazil. In both North America and Europe, the margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity and reduced overheads, offset by stepped up A&C investments to fuel growth. In North America, adjusted OI margin grew 260 basis points to 20.3%, and in Europe, margins were up 390 basis points to 19.7%. As you know, North America and Europe have expanded margins by more than 500 basis points and 600 basis points respectively, since the end of 2013.","In EEMEA, margin was 11.5%, up 770 basis points versus what was an easy compare. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, price increases were insufficient to cover the sharp increases in currency-driven input costs. In this quarter, strong net productivity, favorable vol\/mix and overhead reductions were the key drivers of our margin expansion. In Asia Pacific, margin expanded 310 basis points to 16.1%. This was driven by continued productivity improvements as well as overhead reductions. In Latin America, given the challenging macro environment in Brazil, margin declined 260 basis points to 10.5%. This was largely due to unfavorable vol\/mix and currency, which more than offset significant cost reductions.","Now turning to EPS; adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant-currency basis. The increase was driven by $0.07 of operating gains, including a negative $0.02 impact from mark-to-market and a negative $0.01 from calendar adjustments. Below the operating line, EPS increased $0.05, as lower interest expense, the benefit from a lower share count, and lower taxes more than offset the dilution from the coffee deal. Our coffee investments in both JDE and Keurig had solid quarters and delivered in line with our expectations.","In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders. Specifically we paid out about $270 million in dividends, and purchased $1.2 billion of stock or nearly 29 million shares at an average price of about $41. This amount includes the remaining $500 million of cash received as part of the JDE coffee deal that we committed to use for repurchasing stock. In addition, we opportunistically accelerated a portion of our 2016 buyback program into the first quarter. We continue to expect to buy back approximately $2 billion of stock for the year.","Now turning to our outlook; given our strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2016 outlook and are reaffirming our outlook today. Specifically, we continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 2%, adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%, which is an expansion of at least 200 basis points this year, double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and at least $1.4 billion of free cash flow. In addition, based on recent spot rates, we expect less of an impact from currency translation. For revenue, we expect currency to be a 3 percentage point headwind, down from 6 points. And for EPS, we estimate a $0.05 headwind, down from $0.13.","We've also updated a couple other items to help with your financial models. We currently estimate that our interest expense will be $625 million to $650 million, down about $25 million from our previous estimate. Due to some discrete items in the first quarter, we now estimate our full-year 2016 tax rate will be in the low 20%s, down from the low-to-mid 20%s in our prior outlook.","While we're not providing quarterly guidance, I would like to call out a few items to keep in mind as you think about our second quarter. First, Q2 is typically our lowest margin quarter, given seasonally-lower revenues. Second, as we mentioned earlier, our first quarter benefited from the timing of some overhead spending, which will pressure our second quarter. Finally, as you may know, collective bargaining agreements covering eight U.S. facilities expired at the end of February. The affected employees have been working without a contract since that time, while we continue to bargain in good faith with the union. We've shared our last, best, and final offer with the union. We believe it's fair and the right solution for both our employees and our business. Until we reach an agreement, we expect to incur some one-time costs as we continue the negotiation, while executing business continuity plans for our North America business. Despite these short-term items, we're executing well and are confident in our business momentum and our ability to deliver on our full-year commitments.","So to wrap up, we're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter. We delivered significant margin expansion, solid organic revenue growth and share performance with Power Brands up 4%, positive vol\/mix growth in developed markets, and increased investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. We also returned $1.5 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the volatile operating environment, we're on track to deliver our 2016 outlook as well as our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to ask, and I think I heard a number of points that are worth mentioning, but in terms of the strong first-quarter performance, both EPS margin and even revenue growth, as we think about the full-year guidance, I think I heard some \u2013 a little bit of caution on Brazil, on Russia, on China, as well as some of the timing of overhead spending that can be moving margin around a bit. But I guess I wanted to understand the rationale for holding guidance where it is, and maybe just to answer my own question with those different points there, but are those the ones that are kind of keeping you from being more aggressive with the full-year outlook, in particular on the margin side?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Chris, I think \u2013 look, we're very happy with the start, and I think it really does give us confidence as we think about the year, but it is just one quarter in an environment where, I think, it makes sense to be prudent. You've got an operating and currency environment that's pretty volatile. Consumer demand is somewhat soft, especially in emerging markets. And then we've got a lot going on in the transformation agenda. So, while we're executing well and we're doing the things that we can control and they are on track. I'd just say that the first quarter gives us a nice foundation to feel confident about the year and we'll leave it at that.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just a quick follow-up for you. In relation to the \u2013 vol\/mix was a little stronger than I thought in the quarter, and you made some comments about elasticity in some markets. I just want to get a sense of maybe you can characterize the pricing environment, and price in particular to currency driven-cost inflation. And just the competitive response. So are there markets we should kind of watch out for where you're taking prices up, but competitors have not moved yet, for example?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Actually, Chris, I think a big part of the strong vol\/mix performance that you're seeing is that we've now gotten a lot of that behind us. Our gaps are closing. We've continued to invest in our franchises, particularly our Power Brands and that's playing itself through in vol\/mix, as well as in our share performance. I think the markets that we've called out like Russia, like Brazil, that remain quite challenging from an inflationary and currency standpoint, are the places where there probably will continue to need to be some pricing. But for the most part, most of that pricing is behind us and that gives us great confidence with the foundation that we've built.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Just two quick things from me. First off, Brian, in the guidance around full-year margins, you reaffirmed the 15% to 16% range, but I think on the fourth quarter call, you had specifically pointed to the low end of that range because you had deconsolidated Venezuela at the time. So that wasn't mentioned again this time. Is that just because of the better start around margins to the year, or am I just making more of it than I should?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I said it's about a 200 basis point margin improvement is what we're expecting, and that's the current outlook. So that does put you at the lower end of that range. And it's 200 basis points. So we feel pretty good about that.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Yeah, no change.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No change.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No change. Okay. And then, Irene, you had mentioned that, excluding these strategic actions that you've taken on the top line that you're growing about in line with your categories globally. Does that mean that even though, I guess, Easter was a benefit to global category growth by about a point, that it was not much of a benefit to Mondelez because otherwise I guess...?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well I think, Andrew, the simple answer there's a difference between consumption and shipment. So if Easter was essentially only a week earlier, so most of our shipments last year were in the first quarter. It doesn't change that much, but obviously the consumers' purchasing pattern happens within a week or so of the holiday. So you're going to see the impact. Our consumption was closer to the overall category growth, but our shipments don't reflect that, one because of revenue management, but two because it didn't have that much of an impact on our shipments to our customers.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Got it. And then the sustainability of developed markets volume that you saw and the improvement in \u2013 clearly, in the first quarter, I guess, there was an easier comparison in Europe in the year ago. There was a competitive recall in parts of Europe as well. So I'm just trying to get a sense of your level of visibility and comfort that developed markets volume can kind of remain more sustainably in positive territory as we go forward.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we feel very good about the underlying momentum in our developed markets. Strong vol\/mix performance as well as \u2013 they were doing that while Europe is up 400 basis points and North America up almost 300 basis points. So I feel very good about the hard work that they did over the course of the last year to get the businesses to win and then the opportunity now to build on top of that base. So I think the underlying momentum that we're seeing is solid and will continue for the balance of the year.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Andrew, and that was improving in the second half of last year as well. So, I mean, it's not surprising.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It is not a totally new phenomenon.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just wanted to follow-up, I guess, on Andrew's question, just in terms of building organic sales growth over the balance of the year because, I guess, the comparisons get a little bit more difficult balance of the year, and it sounds as if maybe Brazil, Russia, China, from a macro perspective, a little bit weaker than maybe what you were planning going into the year. And I'm not sure how we should think about Nabisco, if there is some contingency or some potential disruption we have to factor in, in terms of balance of the year organic growth. So, if you could just talk through, A, are net your sort of view in terms of the macro, the same, better, or worse than they were going into the year, and then just sort of where we should look for drivers to get to that organic sales growth over the balance of the year, given that the comps get a little bit more difficult? Thanks.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Bryan, again, the comps do get more difficult, but in part it was because we began, as Brian said, we began to make investments. We got a lot of the pricing behind us as we were in the back half of last year. And so the foundational things that we're doing in terms of reinvesting in high ROI marketing initiatives and continuing the expansion of some of our proven innovation platforms, all of that is in place. As you saw in the first quarter, our A&C is up over 9% of revenue. We're continuing to invest in our key franchises. And that will just continue as the year progress. So, yes, we have a headwind from some of these more volatile emerging markets, but as I said in my remarks, we feel pretty comfortable that we've accounted for those against the stronger momentum that we should see everywhere else.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just, Nabisco, should we be \u2013 or North America, should we just be thinking or having to factor in some sort of probability or chance that there is some disruption? Just trying to figure out how to accommodate that or factor that in.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bryan, I guess it's hard to predict where the negotiations go and the magnitude of an impact would really depend on the outcome of those negotiations. I think as I said, we'll incur some one-time costs, but that's about building business continuity capability and being ready. We're trying to strike a balance, I would say, between the inventory necessary and a business continuity plan, but also the incremental costs. So, we've taken into the account in our plans the possibility of disruption, but again, we'll plan accordingly and we'll deal with that as it happens, but it's hard to predict where that goes.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for the question. First, a couple housekeeping items for you, Brian. Thank you for all the detail on the guidance. The one area you didn't touch on was the equity income line. It came in a little bit stronger than we were expecting. How should we think about that line item in the P&L as we move forward?","And then, also sticking below the line, interest expense too was a bit lower, your guidance suggests it's going to step up. I guess the question there is why? Was there something unique about interest expense, a benefit that's not going to continue on the forward?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, on the equity income line, as I said, the two larger investments there, JDE and Keurig both delivered in line with our expectations, maybe a little bit better in the quarter. I don't see anything that changes our expectation for the year. They're delivering on commitments and I don't think that changes at all. Interest expense, as I signaled in the comments, we're telling you it goes down by about $25 million for the year. It reflects the lower run rate we're seeing in some of refinancing activities we had in the first quarter and a little bit of currency. We're not necessarily dropping that through in terms of the outlook, but it does provide a little bit of an opportunity there.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. And can you enlighten us on what your expectations are for the equity income line? I don't think you kind of touched on it previously. And then, the second question goes back to the comments on trade budget optimization that I think you introduced on last call. I'm just curious if you can give us an update on sort of how those plans are progressing, if we are at a stage where there has been any deployment of different strategies or tactics, and what the learning has been so far?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I'll take the first part. On JDE and Keurig, I mean we provided a page in the web deck that gives you the pieces to estimate that for the year. Nothing's really changed with that. And again, these are private companies. We don't plan on providing a lot of visibility to the ongoing performance or the details of that.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","With respect to revenue management, Jason, we think the opportunity is sizable, particularly on the trade side. And particularly as we think about increasingly focusing on our Power Brands and on our high-return activities. The challenge, of course, is the pace of implementation because it does have an impact in the short term, typically on volume, on share, on customer relationships. And so our approach remains to strike the right balance among all of those variables, but I'm quite confident you will continue to see the benefits of that playing through our margin profile.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, there. Thank you. A question about category growth in biscuits. In prior quarters, you've shown a slide showing the global category growth rate and I don't think I see it here. But last quarter you said it was 7%. And if you're gaining share in 80% of your categories this quarter, the implication is that the category has slowed substantially. I wanted to know, could you give us a little color on that? Like is that just kind of inflationary pricing in 2015 that just isn't happening now in 2016, or is there something else happening for the category in biscuits that we should know about?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, good question, Rob. I would tell you that probably the single biggest impact on the overall category growth is the U.S. It's our biggest biscuit market and we did see that category slowing down. There's a lot of factors that contribute there. Some of our biggest customers are changing some of their merchandising policies, which is having an impact. I think we're still performing quite well within those constraints, but it is having somewhat of an impact on our overall performance. So, I think the facts are, our revenue in aggregate in North \u2013 our biscuit revenue in North America was up almost 3%, very strong vol\/mix, but the category itself was a little weaker than we had seen, and our approach to that is just to continue to invest in our strong brands, to continue to introduce innovation like OREO Thins and GOOD THiNS, which are driving very strong results, and continuing to leverage the fact that we've got much more flexibility in our packaging capability as a result of the addition of assets like Salinas. So, I think we are clearly in charge of the category performance here in the U.S., and we have very strong plans in place to continue to drive that. So I would not read anything more than that into these results","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Appreciate the color. One quick follow-up. Can you give us more specifics on what this overhead shift into second quarter is? Why would it shift from first quarter into second quarter, Brian?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's just simply the timing of some spending that we would have initially probably expected in the first quarter that's sliding into the second quarter. So, we saw a little bit of a benefit on our SG&A in Q1, and it'll be a little bit of a headwind in Q2. Total year doesn't change at all.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks, everyone. I just had two questions. First, you've talked in recent quarters about the potential to begin to rebuild margins in some of your key emerging market regions, and I think the expectation was that this could be more of a 2017 and 2018 dynamic. We're still seeing headwinds in Eastern Europe, Latin America, a bit in Asia. During the quarter, margins were covered pretty sharply and read an all-time high at around 16%. So just curious, Brian, I guess what drove the margin performance there? Whether that was market mix or more sustainable recovery that we could see carry forward through the year?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think it starts with ultimately getting the pricing right, which is clearly what's driving EEMEA and Latin America in the short term. But I do think it's the fundamental work that we're doing on getting net productivity to flow through and gross margins improving, while these regions are also doing ZBB and implementing shared services and all the things that are helping us reduce overhead. So the fundamental cost structure of the regions has gotten better. If we can get pricing right in the markets, we'll see improvement there, and that's what we saw in both EEMEA and Asia Pacific in the quarter, and Latin America was really the pricing challenge and the currency dynamics in Brazil that hurt us. So good progress there, but it's the same fundamental game plan and initiatives that are driving margins everywhere.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And, Irene, I wanted to come back to the GOOD THiNS launch and just get a better sense of how you are thinking about the rollout and the marketing resources there. I know it's still early so we probably haven't seen a huge amount in the marketplace yet, but should we expect to see a stepped up kind of big bet on A&C, or is this the case where you're going to be working more with social media and building out gradually?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we've accounted for it in the context of our overall A&C. We're getting very good returns on our investments behind our Power Brands in the U.S., and we're going to continue to make those investments, so it is accounted for in our aggregate budget. We're very pleased with the early response both from our customers and from our consumers. As I mentioned, it's a 1.4 share after just a couple of weeks in the market. And so we will support it, but it is accounted for in the overall A&C targets that we've given to you.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, David.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","You mentioned that you remain cautious about the volatile economic environment. I was wondering if you could give more color about the trends you are seeing in markets like Russia and Brazil. And, of course, you have the benefit of seeing dollars and volume by week and month. And are you seeing that \u2013 the decline rates stabilize, or is that volatility or the deterioration in recent months just making it too difficult to make a call about the bottom in markets like these? Thanks.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, David, it's a little hard to tell you are we at the bottom. What we're seeing is certainly worse than what we were seeing last year. And our team is managing through it. There's a little bit of a different situation in Russia versus Brazil, but they're both inflationary markets that are causing us to have to price. And it's having some impact on our categories and on consumer demand. So, we do remain cautious about the operating environment in both of those markets. We don't see any near term catalyst, too much of a change. But we're also not expecting it to get dramatically worse. So again, as I said in my remarks, we believe we've accounted for it in the outlook that we're giving to you, but it is one of the reasons that we are being cautious as we think about our outlook for the future.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then, just a quick follow-up on Europe. Can you give some color about the improving trends there? Is this really all about the competitive price gaps? And with the comparisons easing in Germany, does it feel like you're turning the corner after this first quarter? Thanks.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The simple answer is yes. We've taken a number of steps in Europe to get ourselves fit to win and I'm very pleased with the progress that the team has made. Without a doubt we took a very significant revenue management action in Germany last year. We will lap that as we exit the second quarter. And the rest of our business, I'm actually quite pleased to see strong performance on our chocolate business in Germany, ex that customer. We've gotten a terrific response to the incremental investments we have made in our UK chocolate business, where our shares are up almost a point in that geography. Our Power Brands are performing well. So I think we needed to reset our base and address the cost impact on our P&L. We have done that and you're seeing their impact in our gross margins, our operating margins, as well as a return to growth in the region.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. It's Josh Levine on for Ken. Irene, you mentioned strong productivity that drove the gross margin improvements in the quarter. Can you help us think about the drivers, I guess, to the gross margin in more detail? Specifically maybe how much came from new plants, inflation, SKU rationalization that may have gone up (41:56) over and above I guess your typical productivity plans? I guess just any help you can offer about how sustainable those gains were would be great. Thanks.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Simple answer, Josh, is they're quite sustainable. The bulk of that net productivity is just coming from some of the fundamental work we've done with our teams on Lean Six Sigma and the improvements that we're seeing as a result of that. And that is a gift that keeps giving. We certainly are beginning to see some of the benefits of the 40 plus Lines of the Future that are operating around the world, and that is part of the algorithm that allows us to have great confidence, not only about our margin targets for this year, but the 2017 to 2018 target that we've given to you, as well. So it is a combination, but the bulk of it is driven by fundamental execution of our productivity programs around the world, and we're very pleased with that performance.","Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And I guess just one quick follow-up. There had been some recent news about you being in negotiations to sell a bunch of brands and some plants in Europe. I guess both can you just comment on some of the strategies there, some of the reasons for it, and then, to what extent maybe we could see more of that in the future. Thanks.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, look, we continue to focus on Power Brands as a priority, and clearly, there are some opportunities as you look at parts of our portfolio. We have an announced transaction that was in the press involving parts of our French business we sold to Eurazeo, which for us these are a very rational set of actions that are consistent with our agenda here. So we focus on Power Brands and our portfolio. We simplify our supply chain and allows to us invest behind the brands that have the highest returns. So that transaction is something that will likely close in 2017, as you get through regulatory approvals and works councils and all the things that go with that. But I would say that's just part of what we're doing as we think about focusing on Power Brands and there could be more opportunities like that, but nothing to talk about today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Can I ask about the advertising spending? You talked about it being above \u2013 the A&C spending being above 9%. How much was that up year-on-year, and what's the outlook for subsequent quarters in the year? Is it going to be up more or perhaps less going forward? And maybe just to touch on innovation. Where are the big sort of white space opportunities that you're really getting your teeth into this year? What are the main applications of the innovation pipeline in terms of new products at the moment? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, first of all, with respect to A&C, our A&C is up about low-single digit, mid-to-low single digits, and again, as part of our overall plan to continue to improve our share of voice, you will see that going up for the full year. So there's nothing anomalous about the first quarter and we are very pleased that given the strong performance that we are seeing on our margin improvement, we have the opportunity not only to drop that money to the bottom line, but also to reinvest in areas that get a good return for us.","With respect to innovation, we continue to have a very strong portfolio of platforms, and you will continue to see us take those ideas around the world. And so, for example, OREO Thins started in China. We have expanded it to the U.S., Canada, and now into Australia. It's going to be about a $200 million business for us this year. belVita Crunchy, we started in many markets with a soft version, we now we have a hard version, we call it belVita Crunchy, that's going to be about $500 million for us this year as we expand it to a variety of different markets. We have a number of innovations on our Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka franchises that we're taking around the world. So net-net, we've been seeing a double-digit contribution to our revenue growth from these innovations and you'll see that continue and a portion of our investment, as I talk about spending in the 9% to 10% range on A&C, a portion of that is in support of those franchises","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Dave Driscoll with Citigroup.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you for squeezing me in here. I appreciate it. So I had two questions. The first one was just on the constant-currency outlook of 2% or better. Can you talk a little bit about the components of price and volume? I would assume that because foreign exchange pressures are lower, you don't need to take as much pricing as you were previously contemplating. So would it mean that the price piece has come down and then commensurately you would expect volumes to go up because of elasticities, positive elasticities?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The simple answer is yes, David. So as we said to you, our long-term algorithm is a much better balance between pricing and vol\/mix. We were very skewed in these last two years or so because of the very significant impact of currencies, as well as some of our inputs like cocoa. As we move forward, we should see a much different relationship and I think you're starting to see the impact of that play through in our first quarter as you can see pricing is a lesser impact and we're starting to see, even though vol\/mix in aggregate is still negative, it's an improved trend and certainly I'm very pleased to see three of our five regions with positive vol\/mix.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Maybe, Irene, just to say this, but since the 2% number doesn't change, then it's almost got to be like offsetting effects that go on. Pricing come down, volume goes up. And I just wanted to be clear that that is, in fact, how to think about this thing. And I know you guys put the plus sign by the 2%, so we never really know exactly what the figure is. But the right answer here is that you would see whenever pricing doesn't come down or however much it is lower than the previous estimate, the volume elasticity will make up for it.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, David, it's Dexter. Just kind of a quick clarification. At CAGNY, you may recall, in developed markets this year we said it was going to be positive vol\/mix for the year and emerging markets, excluding Brazil and Russia, would be positive for the year, including Brazil and Russia, emerging markets volume would be negative. We really didn't give a total company view, but yes you are right, the pricing benefit obviously should be much more muted than it was last year given the currency dynamics and the commodities dynamics and trends in vol\/mix will definitely improve versus last year as well. And you started to see that play through in the first quarter.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, Brian, just one question for you. But it's \u2013 it might be a fascinating question here. Do you have an assessment on what the impact is to Mondelez from the new treasury rules that were issued on April 4? It seems like there is three areas that there could be some impact, whether it is tax rate, share repurchase or cash repatriation. Do you have any assessment for us on any impacts from those new treasury rules?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","David, what I would say is, we continue to work through that. I would tell you that as we work through it from a tax rate standpoint for modeling purposes, we don't anticipate any impact. There are some other things, as you mentioned, that we'll continue to work through and gain a better understanding of how they may impact us, but nothing to share at this point.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hi, it's Dexter. Thanks for joining the call this morning. I'd be happy to take any further calls or comments as today is \u2013 the rest of the week and of course over the course of the day.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question and answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations, for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO, and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and today's slides, which are available on our website, MondelezInternational.com.","As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. The third quarter macroenvironment remained challenging. But we continued to drive top-tier margin expansion while delivering solid organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic revenue grew 3.7%, led by our pricing actions to recover commodity- and currency-driven input costs, primarily in high-inflation markets.","Adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%, driven by strong net productivity and the early benefits of improvements in our supply chain. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 14.1% while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus prior year on a constant-currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains. However, as expected, these gains were offset by below-the-line items, including dilution related to the creation of our coffee joint venture, as well as higher taxes.","Our performance in the third quarter reflects continued progress in executing our transformation agenda. We further focused our portfolio. In July, we closed on the joint venture to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world. As a result, we received more than $5 billion of cash, including the benefit of currency hedges, and retained a 43.5% interest in the JV.","We strengthened our snacks business through two bolt-on acquisitions, including Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in fast-growing allergen-free snacks in the U.S. We'll look for more opportunities in the future to strengthen our snacks business through additional bolt-on acquisitions like these.","We also continued to aggressively reduce costs, to expand margins and provide the fuel to accelerate our growth. In the third quarter, we significantly expanded gross margin by generating net productivity of more than 3% of cost of goods sold, including the benefits from the installation of almost 30 Lines of the Future around the world. In addition, we remain on track to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue by at least 250 basis points between 2013 and 2016, with additional opportunities thereafter. As Brian mentioned at the Barclays conference in September, we're identifying even more indirect cost savings than our original target. This sets up well for continued savings beyond 2016. We're also well on our way to migrating more than 40% of back-office processes in finance, HR, and several other functions to global shared services. For each of these processes, we'll reduce costs, on average, by half, enabling additional savings through and beyond 2018.","As these supply chain and overhead cost savings come through the P&L, we'll continue to expand gross and operating margins while stepping up investments to drive growth. We're already beginning to see the benefits of this virtuous cycle. In the third quarter, we increased advertising and consumer support as a percent of revenue by 50 basis points to more than 8.5%. Almost all of our incremental investment was behind our Power Brands in key markets and categories, to backstop our pricing actions, improve our share of voice, and accelerate the global rollout of proven innovation platforms, such as Oreo Thins in North America, base Oreo in Russia, Trident and belVita in China, and Bubbly aerated chocolate in India.","In addition, we continue to invest in route-to-market expansion, especially in emerging markets, as we look to strengthen our capabilities and position ourselves to capture more than our fair share of growth as the economies in these markets recover. We're encouraged by this progress and remain committed to our strategy and transformation agenda. As we look ahead, there are three areas where we want to continue to sharpen our focus going forward: on cost savings, growth, and commercial execution.","So we're also announcing some important organizational changes this morning. We've seen great benefit in consolidating our cost agenda under Brian Gladden, our CFO, and our growth agenda under our Chief Growth Officer. We now see a similar opportunity to sharpen our global commercial execution by creating a new role of Chief Commercial Officer, or CCO. Today, we're naming Mark Clouse to that position and appointing Tim Cofer, who currently runs our Asia-Pacific business, as Chief Growth Officer. Mark, in his role as CCO, will oversee the execution of the company's growth plan, with oversight over all five geographic regions, as well as the global sales function.","This new structure should simplify and accelerate day-to-day P&L decision-making and tradeoffs, while focusing investments in those areas that will best drive profitable growth. Tim, in his role as CGO \u2013 with responsibility for corporate strategy; the global categories; global marketing; and research, development, and quality \u2013 will lead the development of next-generation innovation platforms and new business opportunities to accelerate future growth. Brian, Tim, and Mark, together with our region presidents, Daniel Myers, and our integrated supply chain teams, will work hand in hand to continue to advance our transformation agenda and accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines.","Now let's take a closer look at our top line results. As I said, organic revenue growth was 3.7%. Higher prices contributed 7.4 points, with most of the pricing occurring in emerging markets, as we recovered commodity- and currency-driven input costs to protect profitability. Vol\/mix was down 3.7 points, largely due to elasticity in response to new pricing actions in markets like Brazil and Russia, as well as a negative 70 basis point impact resulting from our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. Year to date, the vol\/mix headwind from those decisions was 90 basis points. For the full year, we expect a headwind of up to 100 basis points, as we've shared with you before.","Our Power Brands, which now represent nearly 70% of revenue, delivered solid growth of more than 5%. Emerging markets were up over 10%, due to pricing, with the BRIC markets growing mid to high single digits. Developed markets declined 0.5%, largely driven by our actions to improve revenue mix.","Turning now to our results by region. As I mentioned earlier, pricing in emerging markets drove our growth this quarter. Latin America was up over 17%, driven by inflationary pricing in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low to mid-single digits, as we took additional pricing to recover higher input costs resulting from the recent weakening of the real. This pricing, along with softer categories as macroeconomic conditions deteriorated, pressured vol\/mix in Brazil. We anticipated these difficult conditions and managed the business accordingly. As a result, we don't expect to have a material inventory destocking risk.","Our EEMEA region was up 6%, led primarily by pricing in Russia, in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. We responded with a series of pricing actions that led to over 20% growth in Russia this quarter, which was broad-based across most categories. Vol\/mix declined, however, as categories slowed in response to higher prices and weakening economic conditions. As in Brazil, we're actively managing our inventory levels and do not expect any material dislocation issues.","Asia-Pacific was up 3%, with solid growth in China and Australia, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. China was up mid to high single digits, driven by strong performance in both biscuits and gum. India grew modestly, led by solid chocolate growth, in response to our stepped-up A&C investments.","Turning to developed markets, Europe was down 1.6%, largely due to our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. North America was up modestly, with solid growth in biscuits and candy, partially offset by continued softness in gum.","Turning to our categories, year-to-date snacks are up approximately 5%, and about the same amount if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. Currency-driven pricing remains the key driver of category growth. While our organic snacks growth is about a point below our categories, that's largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our actions to improve revenue mix.","Looking at our overall market share, about 45% of our snacks revenues are gaining or holding share. Although we're not satisfied with this result, we're making sequential progress as expected as our competitors price, consumers adjust to higher price points, and we invest some of our cost savings into incremental marketing support.","Let's take a closer look at each of our snacks categories. Biscuits grew nearly 6.5% year to date, and we grew about 5.5%, with strong performance in China, Brazil, and Russia. Shares were also strong, with about 60% gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S., as well as share gains in Brazil. Power Brand revenues were up high single digits, led by Oreo, TUC, Club Social, and belVita.","The chocolate category increased about 5.5% year to date, while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflects the fact that we led significant pricing in most markets in response to rising input costs. Recently, competitors have begun to price, and in select markets, like the U.K. and India, we've stepped up A&C support. As a result, we're beginning to see improvements in both revenue growth and share. In fact, in the third quarter, our revenue grew low single digits, up from essentially flat in the first half.","Chocolate market share also increased, from about 25% growing or holding in the first half to approximately 30% through September. While share performance remains below what we would like, much of this is due to our revenue mix improvements in Europe, including discontinuing low-margin chocolate product lines. Going forward, we expect share performance to continue to improve, as price gaps narrow and as our A&C investments pay off.","The gum and candy category grew nearly 2% year to date. Our revenue was up 5%, with both gum and candy growing mid-single digits, led by growth of gum in China, and candy in the U.S.","So, as you can see, we delivered solid top-line growth in the quarter, and share has begun to improve in response to increased marketing support in a number of key markets and categories.","Let me now turn it over to Brian, who will provide an update on our third quarter margin expansion and earnings growth.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Irene, and good morning. We delivered strong margin expansion in the third quarter by executing our transformation agenda in a challenging macroeconomic and consumer environment.","Starting with slide 9, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%. This expansion was driven by another quarter of net productivity of more than 3% of COGS. As expected, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point headwind in the quarter, largely due to cycling of a gain in the prior-year quarter. Year to date, mark to market is a 20 basis point benefit. Adjusted OI margin grew 170 basis points to 14.1%. We continue to drive down overheads and offset stranded costs from the coffee transaction by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost-saving tools.","These overhead savings, as well as lower supply chain costs, allowed us to continue to accelerate some A&C investments in a number of key markets and categories in the quarter to support our pricing actions and innovation platform launches, as well as to stimulate category growth and improve share performance. As Irene mentioned, we stepped up A&C by 50 basis points to more than 8.5% of revenue. Based on recent results, our investments are beginning to pay off. We're seeing improvements in our growth and share performance in chocolate in both Europe and India, and in addition our biscuits revenue in North America has begun to accelerate behind our increased marketing support and innovation.","Now let's look at margin improvement by region. As you can see on slide 10, our cost reduction efforts have driven improvement in adjusted OI margins across all of our regions. In North America, OI margin was up 130 basis points, largely driven by strong gross margin expansion, which more than offset increased A&C investment. In Europe, margin increased 270 basis points, as strong net productivity and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C in that market. In Latin America, margin grew 60 basis points, driven by lower overheads. And in Asia-Pacific and EEMEA, margins increased 380 and 210 basis points, respectively, as strong gross margin expansion more than offset higher A&C support. .","Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus the prior year on a constant-currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains of $0.08, which includes a $0.01 benefit from acquisitions and a $0.02 headwind from mark to market as we lapped a gain in the prior-year quarter. Below the operating line, lower interest expense and the benefit from a lower share count offset a $0.04 headwind from taxes, as we cycled an unusually low effective tax rate in the prior-year quarter.","Additionally, and as you know, we're now reporting our portion of the JDE's net income using the equity method below the line. While we don't expect to provide much regular color on the results of JDE, as it's a private company, we've said it would initially be dilutive, and it was this quarter. Some of this is driven by the timing of the close, and some is simply driven by the timing of integration and synergy execution. Prior to the closing of the JV, both partners increased shipments to the trade as a precautionary measure to ensure a smooth transition for customers, which affected JDE's third quarter revenue. While we continue to expect the EPS dilution for the next few quarters, we remain confident in the potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for both shareholders.","Turning to return of capital, on slide 12 you can see so far this year we've returned $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. In addition to paying more than $700 million in dividends, we purchased $3.1 billion of stock, or nearly 80 million shares at an average price of just under $39 a share. In Q3 we bought back a little over $900 million of stock as we opportunistically stepped up our buyback activity, given how our stock traded during the quarter. This means that we have about $6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization that goes through 2018.","Let's turn to our outlook. Given our solid third quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2015 outlook and our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. For 2015, we still expect organic net revenue growth of at least 3%. On a reported basis, currency remains a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates, we estimate currency to have a negative 13 percentage point impact for the year, a little more than our previous estimate of a 12-point impact. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, excluding 20 to 30 basis points of stranded overhead costs from the coffee transaction. We made good progress in offsetting most of the stranded costs in the quarter and expect to fully offset them by the end of the year. We continue to anticipate double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant-currency basis for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we estimate a negative currency impact of $0.33, the same as our previous estimate.","With respect to free cash flow excluding items, we still expect it to be approximately $1 billion for the year. For modeling purposes, we've reduced our interest expense assumption to approximately $700 million, down from $750 million. We maintained our tax rate guidance in the low 20%s for 2015. And while we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program, we anticipate repurchasing around $500 million of our shares in the fourth quarter. In this scenario, we would still have approximately $700 million remaining in coffee transaction proceeds to spend in the first half of next year.","So to wrap up, we delivered another solid quarter in a volatile and challenging macroeconomic environment. We're continuing to make excellent progress against our transformation agenda by focusing our portfolio on snacks and aggressively reducing our supply chain and overhead costs. This has enabled us to expand operating margins in each region while also fueling incremental investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to drive revenue growth and improve market share in our key markets and categories. As a result, we remain on track to deliver our 2015 outlook, as well as our 2016 margin target of 15% to 16%. As the world's leading snacking company, we're one of few industry players with the assets, leadership, and capabilities to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","\u2013 everybody.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Andrew.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two questions for me if I could. First off, with margins continuing to come through as you expect, seems like the key question will be around really the mix between volume and price. And I guess I thought we'd at least start to see volume get sequentially better for the company, particularly with price gaps starting to narrow. But volume got a bit weaker sequentially, and we got more price than we'd modeled. And I guess European volume was still pretty weak despite a very easy year-ago comp. So maybe first could you just update us on the \u2013 again, a little bit more color on the price gap situation in Europe chocolate, and if you need to reassess the strategy there, like perhaps what you did in the U.K. Or have you seen enough movement in pricing in earnest that you kind of feel like you're going to see these price gaps narrow for real?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Andrew, there's no question we are seeing our price gaps narrow, as we had expected. And as we said in our Q2 call, we do expect vol\/mix to improve sequentially in the second half. Our underlying business is performing quite well. We're seeing some very encouraging signs as we look at chocolate in the EU, we look at biscuits in North America, we look at chocolate in India, for example.","The factor that really impacted Q3 \u2013 there's really two. The first is that we did have to take some additional pricing in markets like Brazil and Russia in response to the significant devaluations of their currencies. And that just created another elasticity impact, which just put a little bit more pressure \u2013 again, in the near term \u2013 on vol\/mix. And then the second is just, for the luck of the draw, we had a big heat wave this summer in Continental Europe, and that did have an impact on our chocolate business, so that as we were starting to see those gaps close and make the necessary investments, the impact of those investments just took a little bit longer than we anticipated. Net-net, we would expect that we should see continued revenue growth and share improvement as we make the investments focused in the key areas I've described and as we exit the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Okay, thank you for that. And then, Brian, with respect to some of the supply chain work that you're doing, is there a way to give us, directionally even, a sense of how much that contributed to 3Q gross margins \u2013 and I guess more importantly how that now starts to build as we go forward into 2016?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Andrew, as we've been saying, it clearly is still early days on the supply chain reinvention work and the impact of the Lines of the Future. I would say the third quarter, we've begun to see some of that, but the majority of the \u2013 we talked about 3%-plus net productivity on COGS in the quarter. The majority of that's still driven by base productivity programs. So this is still one where I think, as we've been saying, the majority of the supply chain benefits and all the Lines of the Future that we've been investing in, as you work your way through startup costs and all the things that go with bringing those lines up, it does take some time, and it's really going to be a 2016 dynamic where you start to see some of those benefits.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. This will just be kind of a follow-up to Andrew's question. When I looked at Nestle's results, I thought I saw that they had chosen to not price in line with currency in chocolate in Brazil. And given how big of a competitor they are in Latin American markets in general, I was just wondering if this latest price increase that you took, is that one of the things that you might have to reassess? And are there any other, I guess any other Latin American markets where you see the same dynamic?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, Rob, I would say that our performance in Brazil has been quite strong in the face of some really significant macroeconomic challenges. We've actually grown or held share in all of our categories there. So, as we think about the challenges in chocolate, in many respects, 40% of our chocolate business is in Europe, and I've been clear about what some of the issues were there.","Nestle did say in their call, as you said, that they did not price, but the facts are, as you start to look at individual SKUs, we are seeing movement. So we continue to monitor each of these key categories in our key markets very carefully, and if we need to continue to supplement some of our investments in these markets, as we did in the U.K. and to some extent in Germany, we will continue to do that. But for now Brazil actually has held up remarkably well, growing in the low to mid-single digits in the face of some very significant challenges. But, most importantly, we are holding or growing our shares in all of our categories there.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Rob, I would just say, you look at the currency in Brazil, the third quarter currency, it's up almost 60% year over year. And year to date, it's up 35%. I mean, it's dramatic. The only other point I'd make, Rob, is just, this is also one of the markets where we've put additional A&C, as we've seen the opportunity to reinvest in the growth side of the business.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah, and I can clearly see the good work that you've done in those markets, and you can see it in your results. Just broader speaking, though, if you look at your peers, they aren't taking pricing up to that degree in emerging markets, just in general. So I guess I would hate to see you set yourselves up for setting up price gaps that are bigger than you would hope for, and that was the reason for the comment.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, but again, Rob, we've got some very clear benchmarks with respect to those gaps. We are seeing them close around the world. The speed at which they close varies a little bit market to market, but I'm quite confident that we are managing the right balance between the margin expansion and driving growth, for today and for the future.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Just two quick questions, if I could, please. First would be, just to understand, the incremental investment in A&C has been pretty significant really all through the year. I think you made a comment, Irene, about hitting 8.5% of sales. I had been thinking more like 9%-plus, in terms of where you were headed for. Does that mean you were short this quarter? Or is 8.5% more the right number for where you want to be in terms of A&C investment here in 2015?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, actually, as we've said, Chris, we're going to make steady investments in A&C, as we see the good returns coming from those investments. We're up significantly versus prior year, and we will be for the full year. But we have said that our target for the long term is approximately 10% of revenue, and slowly but surely we're making our way to those levels. But the good news is, we are starting to already see the impact of the investments as a means of backstopping pricing and continuing to build our brand equity. So it's up quite significantly. It will continue to grow, as we have the affordability and as we see strong returns.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Chris, a lot of discipline around tracking ROI around these incremental investments. And some of them, obviously, are going to work and deliver great returns, and some of them that aren't, we're paring those back quickly as we move forward. So a very detailed operating mechanism around those A&C investments.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And I had just a quick question, if I could, on \u2013 your emerging market sales are very strong in the quarter, and I think you mentioned the BRIC countries being up mid to high single digits in the quarter, meaning you had a little bit of acceleration in other emerging markets. You've talked as well about route-to-market investments. Some of this A&C investment, I assume, is going towards these other markets as well. I just thought I'd get a sense of white space opportunities. Are those in part what's helping drive the better emerging market revenue growth overall? Is that where we're seeing the benefit coming through in the top line?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, not yet, Chris. The route-to-market investments we're making today are high-return opportunities to expand distribution on proven categories and brands in key markets. And so we've talked about the investments we're making behind merchandising support, things like visi-coolers that help us in markets like India, improving our penetration in rural India. As we look at China, we're continuing to expand our traditional trade penetration in tier 1 and tier 2 cities and then expanding into tier 3 and tier 4 cities. Brazil, we continue to see the North\/Northeast as a ripe area for investment. So these are near-in, high payback kinds of route-to-market investments. That said, we still see white-space opportunities for us to take our categories to new markets. And obviously gum in China is a great example, biscuits in India, for example. But as we look at our emerging markets, virtually all of them are one- or two-category markets. And it would be our expectation over time that we will be able to see all of our categories in each of our key markets, and that's what gives us great confidence as we think about the runway of growth opportunities.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Had just a question on Mark Clouse's new role as Chief Commercial Officer. And just wanted a little bit more color on two areas. One is, does it also imply or come with the creation of, like, a global sales force? Or will Mark be interacting with sales forces at the regional level? And then, second, one of the things that is cited in the press release is a focus on day-to-day P&L decision-making, and I guess I kind of read that as maybe a sharper focus on trade promotion spending and a way to kind of make it more efficient. So is that a correct read on one of the sort of key areas that you expect to see some focus on?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, Bryan. That's exactly the way to read it. This is not about a global sales consolidation. We believe very strongly that the right aggregation needs to be at the regional level, but think of it more as a center of excellence, the opportunity to take best practices from one market to another. So in addition to making sure that the terrific growth agenda that Mark and his team laid out is now executed through our regions, we do see additional opportunities to capture best practices in terms of execution at point of sale, as well as building our capabilities in areas like trade optimization, as you suggest. So all of those things, I believe, will just help to further strengthen what has been very strong commercial execution.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And in terms of the opportunity within trade, your trade spend, is it a major opportunity just to improve the efficiency there?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We do see that as a big opportunity, and I think you'll be hearing more about that as time goes on. Obviously, the challenge in any of those decisions is getting the right balance between revenue and trade spending. Our goal is to try to find a way to make the dollars we're spending work harder for us. But that is a focus, and we do see that as an opportunity.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Eric.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I just have a couple of questions. I guess first, Brian, on the JV, it sounded like you \u2013 were you signaling that that might be more dilutive than you had initially forecast based on the \u2013 what sounds like a little bit of trade-loading in that business, or other developments?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're not really updating a view for ongoing dilution or accretion. We're only three months into the JV. We don't really have any new information that would lead us to have a different view on where we see that over a long period of time. We didn't really expect much benefit from the JV as you look at the first couple quarters here. I think we do expect that their performance will improve into the fourth quarter, I'd say modestly, and then \u2013 and we move into 2016, obviously quite a bit as they execute on the integration and synergy plans. So, yeah, I mean, there clearly were specific actions that we took, both partners, heading into the close of the joint venture that moved more inventory into the trade. That was intentional to really create a buffer and allow us to feel confident that we could manage through the startup of the new systems and order management and all that went with that, the closing process. But nothing new, Eric, in terms of our view of the opportunity here and the accretion dilution at this point.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess both to Irene and to you, Brian: I guess I'm not exactly \u2013 I guess I'm just a little bit concerned about the volume weakness in the quarter. I mean, it's hard from the outside to figure all this out, but you're spending a ton of capital to put in these highly efficient lines. And these efficient lines, I assume the volume that's going \u2013 that efficiency is a function of the volume that's going through them. And so to the extent that you have other, I guess, cost savings, your decision to price against currency results in weaker volume. It doesn't look like the A&C had a big impact or a positive impact in the quarter. So I guess I'm not really sure what the question is. But I guess I'm a little bit concerned that the decision on FX-related price versus volume weakness makes this whole transformation less powerful because of the fixed-cost absorption not being there. Or maybe you just kind of walk me through why that's not a concern.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I guess, Eric, it's a fair question. But I would tell you that the impact on our volume is uppermost in our mind. But we constantly are evaluating the opportunity to make sure that the margins of these various franchises are attractive enough to warrant the investment, while recognizing that we do create some dislocation. We are leading pricing in most of these markets, and in markets like Russia, for example, we priced three times in the course of this year in response to the significant and rapid devaluation of the ruble. So I feel very good that we are managing to get our margins and protect our margins where they need to be. We are spending back as appropriate.","And as I said in response to the earlier question, the aggregate Q3 results mask some of the impact that our spending is having. Take chocolate in Europe, for example. We chose to delay some of that spending until September, rather than into the summer, because of the fact that we had an unusually hot summer. And therefore it's not a surprise that it is just starting to have an impact now. So I think if you start to look at our shares over the last four-week period, we're seeing a very strong response as the categories in a number of these markets are now growing. You think about markets like India, for example. Think about the U.K., our latest 12-week share is up 1.3 points after share losses up until that point. The latest four weeks were up 3.6 points.","So we're seeing very strong indications that we're getting a good return on the A&C investments. We are carefully monitoring the volume-pricing relationship, because as you rightly point out, fixed-cost absorption is important to us. But in the face of what we're doing, we're generating net productivity of over 3% of cost of goods sold. So I feel pretty comfortable. The algorithm is working, and we should see improved performance, particularly on shares, as we exit the year.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Eric, I would just say as you think about capacity and what we're doing with the supply chain, I mean, we're making real-time adjustments to the capacity, where it goes, how much is volume-related versus in some cases actually closing down capacity sooner, and pulling in some of those programs, given what's going on in the overall market in category growth and volume growth.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Matthew.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just two questions. One, just to focus on the EEMEA region. You're obviously taking more pricing and you were able to protect profit dollars year on year this quarter. Just curious if you can give us any guidance of how we should think about your objectives going forward over the next several quarters, given currency macro pressure? Are you going to look to continue to manage toward protecting profit dollars or margins? And then as you move toward a period of fairly easy margin comparisons, is it feasible to expect margins to maybe remain at the kind of low double-digit levels we've seen over the past six months?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I guess the answer to the first question, Matthew, is that we are seeing the margins improve in response to our pricing actions. We are monitoring the balance very carefully. And as we've said a couple of times, the reaction that we're getting to these pricing actions is pretty much in line with our elasticity assumptions.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think it's a volatile market, there's no question. So, I mean, as the year has played out, it's played out differently than I think we expected. In some cases we're having to make real-time, in-quarter decisions on pricing. But the agenda, in terms of getting supply chain in the right place, in terms of getting the right products in the market, I mean, those are all the things that we're focused on. We will have a period of some easier compares given we're lapping some of that volatility in the first part of next year.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But I will say, if you look at markets like Russia, where as I said we priced three times in the course of this year in response to the significant devaluation, our shares are holding up remarkably well. And the reason for that is we have continued to invest in our marketing support, as well as innovation -","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","\u2013 and that playbook is working well for us around the world.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. But fair to say we may still continue to see some of that same level of margin volatility. Or it's hard to say that may not occur?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's hard to predict what happens in those markets. I think that's the reality.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think EEMEA, of course, is a massive case in point. So I think the volatility we're seeing there is more extreme than almost anywhere in the world. But, again, our focus is to keep our eyes on the markets, to understand where we stand from a share perspective. And, where we feel the need to supplement our investment, we're making those choices.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And, Irene, could you just talk a little bit about the retail environment in the U.K.? Because there's been some renewed reports suggesting a more aggressive approach by retailers in how they're managing the confectionery category. And I know you've done a lot proactively here, but are you seeing evidence of another wave of this? Or could this be a risk factor looking out over the next year?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think so, Matthew. I mean, the European retail environment is challenging. And I think we have been able to hold our own quite well. They're interested in some of the very same things that our retailers around the world are interested in: what's happening in health and wellness, what's happening on the innovation front. And as long as we continue to drive traffic to their stores, we're an important partner. I'd also tell you that we're increasing our e-commerce business with a number of partners in the U.K. who are very much at the forefront of this click-and-collect initiative that you hear about. And so I think the combination of all of those things gives us great confidence that, as we've now gotten our margins in Europe where we want them to be, that we should see a continued improvement in our overall revenue and share trends.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, Irene.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Bernstein.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Alexia.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Alexia.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi there. We've been hearing a little bit about some organizational changes and head count rationalization that may have been put in place over the last few months. Can you comment on the kind of structural changes that you might have put in place? And maybe the impact it may have on head count. I mean, we'll see that in the 10-K when it's published next year. Any order of magnitude would be very helpful. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Alexia. Look, I think these are the initiatives we've been talking about for a while when you think about overhead reductions, when you think about what we're doing with ZBB. I mean, the two big ones that we've spent time talking about, clearly a shared services model that we even mentioned in the comments today, where we're moving a significant proportion of our backroom processes around finance and HR and some other functions to outsourced partners in most cases. But that's causing significant changes in our org model and disruption around the world. But that's something that we've spent a lot of time working through a process to execute that, and we feel good about really how that's going.","The second one is really moving to the category model, and that's something that we've been doing over the last, frankly, couple years. And really changing the structure of how we run the businesses at the region level and in the countries. So that is work that's been going on and, frankly, will continue as we optimize around a category-driven model. Those are the two big ones, and not really providing a lot more detail in terms of specific actions that go behind that.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Alexia.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citigroup.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, David.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Brian, I think the guidance means that the fourth quarter operating margin is something similar to the third quarter. So maybe just slightly above that 14%, if my updated model here is done correctly and the quick math. And if that's right, then the real question is that, for 2016, you guys reiterated this 15% to 16% margin. I mean, we are here in October, and so I feel like 2016 is a stone's throw away. To go to the top end of that, to go to 16%, I mean, that's almost like 200 basis points \u2013 or rounding here \u2013 200 basis points of improvement to get to that top end. That seems like quite a lot. At this point, kind of given a slow backdrop, Irene, a clear desire by the company to want to keep investing in the business in these white spaces around the world, doesn't that top end seem like a stretch at this point? Is that fair? Or are there some comments that you can provide here?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, appreciate the question, David. We're obviously not going to provide an outlook for next year at this point. I would tell you your math makes sense as you think about the fourth quarter. I would tell you it's a prudent view of how we think about the fourth quarter, given the volatility that we see in the business, and some of the markets as we've called out. But it also allows us to have some flexibility around what levels we want to reinvest, and add additional A&C to the business, to get that balance between the top line and bottom line, and get some growth back.","So we feel great about the progress with supply chain and shared services, as being key elements that are going to provide additional upside as we head into next year. We're at a point where we've seen pretty significant improvement. If you look at year-to-date margin improvements, it gives us confidence that that sort of a jump is reachable. So we're building on the momentum we have this year, and we'll update you on how we think about 2016 as we close out the year.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good morning, everyone. Just finishing up on a couple of quick questions. One is Salinas; can you give us an update on that? And how are the other projects of the reconfiguration going in certain areas, Bahrain and around the world?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So far so good. We announced a $130 million investment last quarter in Salinas. It is one of the key drivers of our improvement in North American margins over time. And so far so good. So, as we said, most of our supply chain investments, as we think about the progress we're making in Bahrain, in China, in Europe, all around the world, we're making some very good progress on the investments that we've made, and they'll be a key driver \u2013 as Brian just said, it'll be a key driver of our performance as we go into 2016, and then into 2017-2018.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And my final question is, on inventory management, I know you guys have changed it over the last couple years. Can you give a little bit more in-depth idea of what has actually changed? Because this seems to be a problem with many other companies, and you guys have obviously navigated quite successfully over the last year, year and a half. And I was just trying to figure out what makes you guys more successful at this? What has changed?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, Ken, we learned our lesson the hard way. And the facts are, we're not doing anything herculean. We're simply making sure we have the data, and we are looking at it at all levels of the company on a regular basis. And I think what we discovered in markets like China, for example, it's a fairly complex supply chain, and therefore keeping our eye on the pulse of the business is critically important. I referenced Brazil and Russia in my remarks because they're volatile, and it's imperative that we monitor our inventory situation to make sure that we're keeping track of demand. So it's really not rocket science, but I have great confidence that as we continue to experience volatility in this challenging macroenvironment, that we're well-positioned to manage our businesses and continue to deliver our commitments.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We've made investments in IT tools and connectivity with our channel partners and trade partners to give us that real-time visibility, which is something we haven't had, so that's been an important addition to the process.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Operator","That was our final question.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.","Shep Dunlap - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO, and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","Before we get started, please note one change in our non-GAAP measures. Consistent with majority of our peers, we're no longer electing to qualify commodity and currency-related derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, we've redefined our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS measures to exclude gains and losses or mark-to-market impacts on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives until the related inventory is sold. In doing so, we'll eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS results. For your reference, we've included a schedule in the appendix of today's slides with mark-to-market gains and losses that were reflected in adjusted operating income in prior periods for comparability.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Shep, and good morning. As you've all seen throughout the year, the macro environment remains challenging. Consumer demand across the globe has slowed, and we continue to deal with choppy conditions in some emerging markets. In the face of this slower growth environment, we've continued to deliver solid financial results.","Through the first nine months, we've made progress in several areas. Although our top-line is not yet where we'd like it to be, year-to-date organic net revenue grew 1.6%, led by our Power Brands, which were up more than 3%. Importantly, these results reflect a steadily improving contribution from volume\/mix.","We've continued to aggressively reduce overheads, and improve the efficiency and cost structure of our supply chain, while making necessary investments to accelerate growth. As a result, we've been able to expand adjusted operating income margin by 260 basis points. What's more, we've increased adjusted EPS by 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by operating gains.","Brian will provide more detail on our Q3 performance in a moment, but I'd like to underscore a few highlights. As Tim Cofer, our Chief Growth Officer, shared at the Barclays Conference in September, we're focused on accelerating volume-driven revenue growth. Although there's still room for improvement, we're making progress as vol\/mix turned positive in Q3, with solid contributions from North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Over the past seven quarters, we've delivered a better balance of pricing and vol\/mix while increasing profitability. Going forward, we'll continue to invest to support this balance because it's critical to sustainable top-line growth.","Our Power Brands delivered another solid quarter and, once again, outpaced category growth. We're pleased to see that our largest, most important brands continue to perform well, even in the face of challenging market conditions. On the bottom-line, we delivered another quarter of outstanding margin and earnings growth, with adjusted OI margin up 220 basis points, and adjusted EPS up more than 40% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date results position us well, not only for the balance of this year, but also as we progress toward our 2018 adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18%.","Finally, we remain committed to a balanced and disciplined capital deployment plan, one that drives long-term growth through reinvestment in the business while providing compelling capital returns to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders, including $1.8 billion in share repurchases.","Looking ahead, we expect the environment to remain challenging, but we will continue to deliver our financial commitments by maintaining focus on what we can control, and by executing the three pillars of our growth strategy. First, as we contemporize our core, we're increasing A&C support behind our Power Brands, selectively investing in trade to narrow price gaps, sharpening connections with our consumers through digital marketing, and innovating to redefine permissible snacking. This is playing out in our improving vol\/mix and solid performance of several key Power Brands. For example, Oreo, belVita, and Milka, all posted mid- to high-single-digit growth year-to-date, and we have solid momentum behind our Thins biscuit platform, which includes innovations like Oreo Thins and Chips Ahoy! Thins on the sweet side and GOOD THiNS and Ritz Crisp & Thin on the savory side.","Second, we're filling key white spaces by establishing beachheads in key markets. We recently launched chocolate in China, where initial response to our Milka bundle has been very positive. We're also launching Mainstream and Premium Chocolate in the U.S., where we believe the Oreo and Green & Black's brands will resonate well with consumers. We acquired the license to sell Cadbury branded biscuits around the world. This will enable us to grow our Cadbury choco-bakery portfolio in more than 100 markets. And in Japan, we launched Oreo, Ritz, and Premium biscuits in September, following the repatriation of our brands there. These white space opportunities will unlock sizable incremental growth in the near-term beyond our current run rates.","And third, we're continuing to drive selling and channel ubiquity by expanding our routes to market and improving in-store execution. This includes a significant focus on e-commerce, which grew approximately 40% in Q3.","Of course, given the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we're being quite selective with our investments. This helps balance margin expansion with revenue growth, both short and longer term. Net, we remain confident that a focused and disciplined growth strategy, our strong record of delivering cost saving and margin expansion, together with our improving cash flow, will enable us to accelerate growth on both the top- and bottom-lines over the long-term and create significant value for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. We performed well on a number of key measures in Q3, and again, delivered solid financial results. Organic net revenue increased 1.1%, despite the negative impact of approximately 80 basis points from our revenue management actions. Our Power Brands again drove our top-line, up 2.5%. And as Irene mentioned, we delivered another quarter of vol\/mix improvement which drove almost half of the revenue growth. Emerging markets rose 2% due to currency-driven pricing and inflationary markets. Our developed markets increased 0.6%, driven by positive vol\/mix, while also significantly expanding margins.","Now let's take a look at our margin performance. We delivered another quarter of robust adjusted OI margin expansion. Our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to approximately 40%. Continued strong net productivity drove the improvement, which was somewhat offset by higher trade and pricing investments in a few key markets. Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 220 basis points. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in overheads as a result of zero-based budgeting and the expansion of global shared services. The margin improvement included a net benefit of approximately 30 basis points from certain non-core items such as VAT-related settlements, gains from the sale of property, and costs related to our U.S. labor business continuity planning.","As Shep mentioned at the beginning of the call, these results now exclude the impact of mark-to-market, which was immaterial in the quarter. Making this change allows for some reduction in both complexity and cost, while providing investors with the same transparency of mark-to-market impacts.","We continue to be pleased with our progress on the cost agenda and margin expansion. We're ahead of plan for the year, and we'll be even more aggressive in both overheads and cost reductions, given the more challenging top-line growth environment. At the same time, we're fully committed to support our Power Brands with increased A&C investment. In Q4, we expect to make additional investments to drive revenue and share growth as we head into 2017.","Let me now provide some color on our performance by region. In North America, we delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion as adjusted OI margins improved by 220 basis points, primarily driven by continued overhead reductions and good net productivity. On the top-line, our North American business grew about 1%, driven by solid vol\/mix. Biscuits growth was led belVita, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, and Wheat Thins, which all posted solid gains. Despite soft gum and candy results, Sour Patch Kids delivered another strong quarter of growth while expanding share, and Stride posted double-digit growth following the brand's re-launch at the end of Q2.","Europe also delivered another quarter of strong margin growth, with adjusted OI margin up 230 basis points to 19.7%. Productivity and lower overheads drove those gains. Organic net revenue was up 1%, primarily due to solid vol\/mix. Biscuits posted significant growth, thanks to strong results in the UK and France. Chocolate growth in Germany was also a key driver.","In EEMEA, market dynamics deteriorated, especially in the Middle East, as the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia deal with the ongoing pressures resulting from persistent low oil prices. As a result, organic revenue declined just over 1%, and adjusted OI margin decreased 100 basis points driven by lower volume leverage. We're planning for continued weak demand from the Middle East markets over the next few quarters. Once again, however, Russia was a relatively bright spot in the region, posting double-digit growth in biscuits and modest single-digit growth overall. Please take note that this will be the last quarter we talk about EEMEA, as we consolidate this region into our Europe and Asia Pacific businesses. Details of the change are provided in our second quarter and third quarter 10-Qs.","In Asia Pacific, adjusted OI margins grew 340 basis points to 13.4%, driven by improved overheads and good productivity. Organic revenue increased 1.5%, primarily due to vol\/mix improvements, as AP grew for the sixth consecutive quarter. India posted mid-single-digit growth, fueled in part by continued strength in chocolate, and the launch of Bournvita biscuits. Southeast Asia delivered good share momentum with solid top-line growth in both the Philippines and Vietnam. We continue to see great results from our Kinh Do acquisition as Vietnam delivered high-single-digit growth. Biscuits grew share by nearing two points. China declined slightly due to soft demand across most categories. That said, we continue to hold or grow shares across our categories and are encouraged by the early market feedback on our launch of Milka chocolate.","In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 540 points to over 15%, primarily driven by the VAT-related settlement in the quarter. Excluding this settlement, margins still posted solid growth. Organic net revenue increased nearly 3%, led by Mexico and Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single-digits, driven by balanced vol\/mix and pricing, while Argentina grew high-double-digit through pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.","Consistent with our commentary from last quarter, Brazil continued to be difficult, as the economy remained in deep recession. Government austerity measures, tight credit conditions, and high unemployment are all weighing on consumption. We took actions to narrow price gaps in the quarter and we delivered modest growth in chocolate. We're being very selective to protect margins, but we're still seeing some down-trading, especially in biscuits. Unfortunately, we don't see any short-term catalyst for improvement in the Brazilian economy and are planning for this challenging situation to continue into at least the first half of 2017.","Let me now spend a few moments providing some highlights on the category performance. In aggregate, category growth continued to slow in the third quarter, and is now at 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. While our growth has trailed categories overall, this is primarily due to our revenue management actions and reflects a conscious decision to forgo revenue with lower margins. Our biscuits business grew nearly 2%, with strength in the UK, the U.S., and Germany. Both belVita and Oreo continued to drive our biscuits results. The launch of Chips Ahoy! Thins in the U.S. also fueled the category. Three quarters of our revenue grew share. Chocolate grew 2%, driven by solid results in the UK, Germany, and India. More than half of our revenue grew share in this category.","As we discussed at the Barclays event in September, we're launching chocolate in the U.S. and are encouraged by the initial customer feedback. A limited selection of products will be available in the market during the fourth quarter. This, together with our recent launch of Milka in China will begin to have a more material impact on revenue in Q4 and into 2017. Gum and candy increased just over 1%, led by solid performance in Mexico and the U.S. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.","Turning to earnings per share, in Q3, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.52, which was up 42% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by strong operating income, as well as lower taxes and continued solid results from our coffee equity investments.","Moving to cash flow and capital return, as we highlighted in September, we continue to have a strong focus on improving our cash conversion cycle. To that end, in Q3, we generated approximately $500 million of free cash flow. Several factors such as improving margins, declining CapEx, lower restructuring charges, and improved cash conversion metrics put us in a good position to double our free cash flow in 2018.","During the quarter, we returned more than $700 million of capital to shareholders, which brings us to $2.6 billion in capital return through nine months. To-date, we've repurchased approximately $1.8 billion of shares, at an average price of $41.64. We've now increased our target for share buybacks, and expect to repurchase approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter.","Before I turn to the outlook, you likely saw that we launched a debt tender and also raised $3.75 billion in new notes last week. As you would expect, we're taking advantage of favorable market conditions, and very attractive pricing to lower our interest cost and increase our flexibility. This is expected to be debt neutral, as we intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance to fund all or a portion of the tender offer, while using the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes including funding near-term debt maturities.","Now to the outlook. Given the slower category growth environment and more challenging conditions in emerging markets, we now expect full year organic net revenue to grow approximately 1.6%. This includes about 100 basis points from our revenue management actions. Underlying that revenue growth, we expect positive vol\/mix in the fourth quarter and flat to slightly positive vol\/mix for the full year. We remain on track to deliver our 15% to 16% adjusted OI margin target. We expect to achieve this while making additional growth investments in the fourth quarter to stage 2017. We're also increasing our EPS outlook for the year, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance. We now expect full year EPS to be up approximately 25% on a constant currency basis. And with respect to free cash flow excluding items, we continue to expect to deliver at least $1.4 billion for the year.","So to wrap up, we feel good about our year-to-date performance, especially in light of the difficult macro backdrop. We're pleased with the improving quality of our top-line despite slower growth overall. Our vol\/mix trends continue to demonstrate healthy improvement, including positive growth in Q3 and flat to positive growth for the full year. Our teams continue to deliver significant adjusted OI margin expansion, while increasing investments in our Power Brands. And we're making capital return a priority with $2.6 billion returned to shareholders year-to-date.","Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our commitments and remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. As usual, we'll provide our outlook for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call. And with that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The floor is now open for your questions. Your first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Good morning, Bryan.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Good morning, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess just wanted to follow-up on, in the course of the presentation you made a few references about, particularly in some of the emerging markets, just that the macro environment's pretty weak and also even the snack category growth, which I guess on slide eight, you've seen kind of the category decelerate. So can you \u2013 and I know it's a little early to talk about 2017, but can you just talk about how you're thinking about sort of the macro environment as you're planning for 2017? And also against that backdrop, what gives you the confidence that you get a little bit of improvement sequentially in sales growth for the fourth quarter given just that it seems like the environment may be even getting a touch worse?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Well, Bryan, first of all, we are not expecting a dramatic change in the macro backdrop and so we continue to plan our business accordingly. We're focused on what we can control. So we're going to continue to focus on our cost structure and making sure that our investments are being laser-focused on the places where we think we can get the best returns. That algorithm is working well for us, and we will continue to deploy that algorithm as we look into 2017. So we're not going to give you any guidance today, but I will tell you our playbook is going to look quite similar, where we're going to continue focus on our Power Brands and focus in those places for investment that we think we can get the best return while continuing to streamline our cost structure to drive our margin expansion.","As we think about the fourth quarter, we are not expecting a real change in the base momentum of our business today, but we have a number of incremental initiatives that we talked about in the course of the conversation here. We're continuing the roll-out of China chocolate. We launched it in late Q3 and we'll get a benefit in Q4 and into 2017 from that roll-out. We'll start to benefit from the initial shipments related to our chocolate launch in the U.S. behind the Oreo and Green & Black's trademarks, as I mentioned. We're repatriating our Nabisco brands, particularly Ritz, Oreo, and Premium in Japan. That will be incremental to our base. So all of those actions, on top of our base momentum, is what gives us confidence that we will see some improvement in momentum as we exit the year.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you. And can I just follow-up on this category slowing, is that more just macro like you've just got weakness in certain markets, so emerging markets, or is there something structural that's going on?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","We don't see anything structural. There's no question in some of these markets, given our strong market positions, we have an obligation to fuel that growth of the category, and that's why we're continuing to make investments, we're continuing to focus our innovation pipeline on the launch of well-being products like GOOD THiNS and that is helping to stimulate market growth. But overall, the major factor is the macroeconomic backdrop, which clearly has a dampening effect on consumer demand.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you, Irene.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just wanted to clarify, in Latin America, I think you said the margin improvement was mainly because of the VAT settlement in the quarter. Could you help us quantify exactly how much that helped?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","In Latin America, it was fairly significant, it represents \u2013 and it'll be laid out in the Q, I think we give the dollars, actually. It's in the range of $30 million \u2013 $35 million of benefit for the VAT settlement. But the margins otherwise in LA [Latin America] were actually up year-over-year, excluding that. So there's good progress on that productivity as well as overheads in Latin America.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And is that a onetime thing or...","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...Latin American VAT is not my expertise? Okay. Perfect.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","It is, yeah.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Irene, you said this morning that some of your revenue initiatives will lead to I think \"sizable\" incremental growth in the near-term. I'm just trying to figure out, you hopefully laid out some of the tailwinds, U.S. chocolate, Cadbury, biscuits, and I think the launch of some products in Japan. As you think about all of these, I guess which is the most important in terms of pushing your sales higher? I'm just trying to get a better sense of maybe the opportunity you see in each of these.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Well, certainly from a magnitude standpoint, China's the world's second largest economy so we feel very good about, very bullish, about the launch of chocolate in China. We have had very strong results from our launch of gum in China. It's over $200 million business today. We only launched it two years ago or so. So that's probably the biggest. But the U.S. is the largest chocolate market in the world, and we think we're well positioned with a mainstream offering in terms of the Oreo chocolate and then a premium offering under the Green & Black's trademark. That will be offered both online and in e-commerce, and we have \u2013 we think those can be sizable additions to the portfolio. So those would be the two biggest on the incremental side. And then certainly, as we enter 2017, we'll share with you our innovation pipeline for 2017, but we've got some very strong contributors there as well.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Irene.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Just two questions, if I could. First, just with respect to mark-to-market, I guess, maybe what drove the timing to make that adjust this quarter as opposed to, like, at the end of the year, let's say? And then, given, I think, the mark-to-market was a headwind of about $50 million on a year-to-date basis, I guess can you confirm that the full year margin guidance would still apply even if the mark-to-market was still included? First question.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah, it does. I mean, it was never contemplated. I mean, we always assumed zero in our guidance for mark-to-market and then you get quarter-to-quarter volatility, and then sometimes year-over-year, obviously, volatility. Year-to-date, it basically creates 30 basis points of favorability by excluding mark-to-market, so it's been a headwind of 30 basis points. The timing, I would say, Andrew, I mean, it's something we've been looking at and benchmarking. I think \u2013 we thought about the timing. The reality was it was relatively minor in the quarter, relatively minor for the year. As we think about places where we're putting hedges on for longer periods of time, it just got to the point where the volatility has increased over time. It has been more pronounced over the last year or so. And it just seemed like the right time to do it.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Okay, thanks for that. And then on gross margin, I guess, margins didn't expand on the gross margin side as much as we had modeled in the quarter.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yep.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I guess with all of the supply chain productivity that's really building and starting to come through, in theory a lot more powerfully, I guess I was surprised by that. And so I'm trying to get a little more clarity on that. Was it just the trade spending that you talked about? Is that still an impact that we'd see in the fourth quarter? And is there any change to sort of the expectation of getting to 42% to 43% gross margins by 2018?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","No, look, I think \u2013 so, it was 30 basis points in the quarter. It's up 110 basis points year-to-date. It will continue, Andrew, to be a big driver of margin expansion delivery for us, and feel good about the supply chain reinvention plans. Net productivity execution continues to be very strong. We gave you a range for how we're executing there. And I would just say we continue to see a lot of runway into 2018 and beyond with the supply chain and gross margins. So there were several areas where we invested trade spending, adjusted pricing, really trying to balance growth in margin, given competitive environment.","Over time, as our algorithm, as we've said, we think we can manage pricing net of commodities to the point with where we can drop through productivity and allow pricing net of commodities to be about flat. But that'll be over time and it won't be linear. It will vary quarter-to-quarter. I think that's what you're seeing. Feel good about the overall margin delivery, offset some of the gross margin challenge with SG&A, and delivered. We're up year-to-date 260 basis points on OI. So we tend to think about it that way. It will vary, it will be a little bit lumpy and we feel good about the execution on supply chain.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just wanted to ask first, if I could, as you think about some of the activities around revenue management this year, I guess without getting into guidance, is the expectation that those will not continue in 2017? So hopefully your growth is more like your categories in 2017?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","That's what we've been saying, Chris. I think that's still true. We are continuing our work on trade optimization and learning more there. I think we still have opportunity there. It will be a little bit of a headwind. SKU reductions and overall pruning, I think, has tailed off a bit, pardon the pun. But it ultimately is one where I think we're in a position where that will be a smaller impact as we head into next year and we'll update you on that in February.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And I may have missed it in your remarks, but I just want to understand, the third quarter is supposed to be a quarter where you had a larger increase in A&C spending, and then less so on the fourth quarter. Is that the way it worked out? Because you also mentioned you were going to increase that in the fourth quarter as well. Just trying to get, like, order of magnitude or how it may be different from what you thought before.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","No, it's playing out pretty much the way we had thought, Chris. We're spending about 9% of revenue, and given the market conditions, we're being quite selective in where we spend that money and certainly within the mix we're paying a lot of attention to making sure that we're spending behind our Power Brands and the places we can we think we can get the best return. And within A&C, we're putting a lot more emphasis on advertising rather than consumer promotion. And within advertising, we're shifting more to digital around the world. So, net, is the mix of that spending is looking a little different. The magnitude of the spending is essentially what we thought, at about 9% of revenue, and you will see that play through into the fourth quarter as well.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","And, Chris, when you look at the magnitude of the white space launches, whether it's chocolate in China or the U.S., or even Japan, I mean, those are places that are going to require some incremental investment as we head into the fourth quarter. So that's one of the drivers as we talk about the incremental investment in Q4.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for the time.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Matt.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Brian, first I just had a follow-up on gross margin. How would you characterize where you stand right now in terms of generating a sufficient level of volume to be able to really effectively realize the full margin benefits of the Lines of the Future? And is the slowing category growth outlook going to be a constraint in that respect as you try and move up toward that 42% to 43% target?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, Matthew, I would just say, it is a challenge, it is something that we, obviously, are dealing with. And you heard me call it out in region performance, and it's affected Latin America and EEMEA, most recently in the last quarter, the volume leverage. But I would just tell you that the supply chain team is adapting the plans. We've pulled CapEx, as we talked to you about in September; that was volume-related out in many cases, redeployed that in additional programs that are more focused on getting cost out and delivering the benefits. So I think it's \u2013 yeah, it's a pressure, but I would tell you that our team is reacting, and we're refocusing the plans where we can see the benefits.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","The other thing I'd say, Matthew, is just like in A&C, we're continuing to distort those investments to the places where we think we can get the best return. So most of our Lines of the Future are for our Power Brands, which, year-to-date, are growing over 3% in excess of our categories. And so, that's the reason why we will continue to disproportionately focus our attention and our investments on those Power Brands, because they are inherently advantaged. And as we then start to produce them on Lines of the Future, they're even more advantaged.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And, Irene, I also wanted to \u2013 sorry \u2013 come back to the issue of price gap management and some of the tactical trade promotion that you've been doing. You've been fairly vocal about U.S. biscuits in Brazil, but are you seeing similar dynamics in any specific markets or categories in Europe and Asia, given that we did see some price deceleration in those regions as well?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","No, I would say, those are the two most pronounced. And again, we're continuing to see the reality that that investment does not necessarily stimulate category growth. And so, over time, we are continuing to invest in the underlying equity of our franchises, even in those markets, because that is really the way to drive long-term category growth. Particularly in markets like our emerging markets, one of the benefits of our supply chain reinvention, aside from recapitalizing onto or capitalizing onto more efficient assets is the flexibility that they give us to be able to make packages of different sizes. And that's been an important tool in our arsenal as we seek to make sure that we're providing adequate value on our brands. So that's how we're managing it. And, again, I think as you see the results, we're starting to see vol\/mix. We're pleased to see vol\/mix playing a more important role and a positive role, both in this quarter and then certainly as we look at the full year.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks again, Irene.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","In the gross margin year-on-year change, you talked about how it looks a lot better on a constant currency basis. Could you talk about what the transactional headwinds have been in there and whether those are expected to persist? And then as a follow-up, how quickly are you expecting to ramp-up distribution on the chocolate in the U.S. market? And how early in 2017 do you expect the broad-based marketing campaign to start? Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take the first part. I think gross margins in general, currency this year has been a bigger impact for us than commodity. That's forced us, in some cases, to price, and that's created some of the challenges we've talked about in a couple of the emerging markets. But I would say, for the most part, it's moderated. The UK continues to be a bit of an outlier with the recent Brexit impact, and we're working our way through that. We're pretty balanced, though, as you look at the UK, as I said, in the second quarter, our exposure on the transaction basis in the UK is balanced, given we have production. Quite a bit of our supply comes out of the UK and is based in local currency.","So for the most part, that's not as significant as you might expect. We do also then buy a lot of our cocoa in British pounds and that as well has created a bit of a cushion for us in other parts of the global business. So that said, cocoa in the recent weeks and even a couple of months has actually inflated a bit in U.S. dollars. And if that persists, that will be a challenge for us as we move forward, we'll have to monitor and manage that as we move into 2017. But I think, for the most part, in gross margin we've done a reasonable job this year balancing the impact of transactional currency and pricing appropriately in key markets.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","As we think about the chocolate support, Alexia, we're just turning on the support in China right now, as I mentioned, we're just shipping the bulk of our inventory into our customers. The U.S. support is actually going to be more into 2017. I'm not going to tell you exactly when because I think our competitors would love to know the answer to that. But it is a big piece of our plan for next year, and an important part of our confidence about the incrementality of the opportunity.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for the question. Brian, you mentioned improving cash conversion metrics on the forward. You guys have been holding me on the line on your free cash outlook for the year. As you mentioned in September, you took down your CapEx outlook and certainly today your EPS outlook implies a more robust net income figure. So I guess my question is, where is the cash leakage on that? Net income's going higher, CapEx is going lower, but free cash flow's kind of flat lining. Why aren't we seeing better conversion on this?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","I think the simple answer, I mean, clearly it's a year where we're maxing restructuring spending. This is the peak year along with last year and next year that will begin to go down, Jason. That's probably the biggest. We have said at least $1.4 billion; I think we're encouraged with the progress. We're a bit above our own expectations on cash conversion cycle year-to-date. So we'll see how it plays out in the fourth quarter. As you know, it's a big load of cash that comes in in the fourth quarter given the linearity of the business. So we'll see. But we're feeling good about it. And as I said, cash conversion cycle's ahead of plan, even our internal plans.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, got it. That's helpful. And one more and I'll pass it on. Just in terms of the tax outlook, it looks like you've kind of tweaked it down a little bit, not as big as maybe I thought it would be at first blush from the release this morning. How sustainable is it or should we be sort of wary of a potential tax rate step-up in the future?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, based on all we know, I mean, we're saying about 20% (39:20) for the quarter. It implies something in the low- to mid- 20%s (39:24) for the fourth quarter. We haven't changed our long-term guidance which is in the mid- 20%s (39:29). And I think that's just, over time, the mix of business evolves and some tax statutes expire that have given us a bit of an advantage. So we'll manage it. You have discrete items. We had a significant number of discrete items in the quarter around the U.K. and Europe and in Latin America \u2013 more than we would typically have \u2013 that drove the lower rate. So nothing's really changed, I would say, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, David.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sorry about that, I was on mute. Just to follow up on promotion spending. It looks like trade investment is having modest volume payoffs, but it's offsetting some of that other revenue management benefits that you're getting to pricing and gross margins. What's been your self-grade on the revenue management that you're deploying, including the recent promotion efficiency? Has it been worth it, some of these reinvestments? And then what should we be looking for in terms of the cross currents to gross margins from that trade spend? Thanks.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, again, I break it into the three pieces. I mean, the SKU rationalization and pruning, and in some ways walking away from very low margin business. Obviously, that's helped us contribute to the margin expansion. It's been an element of that margin progress. Revenue management itself and the trade optimization piece of that, I would say, we're still making progress in the early phases of that. We're focused on 10 markets where the majority of our revenue is. And the majority of our trade spending, we've resourced it appropriately. We're finding opportunities to spend our dollars more effectively. To be honest, we're finding opportunities to actually grow revenue by appropriately allocating those dollars and distorting those dollars. The analytics have proven to be incredibly powerful, and the centralization and aggregation of that data is very powerful.","So I think that will continue to be something that we resource and build into our plans for next year. It is mixed. It will have some pressure on revenue in some markets, and as I said, with the optimization of promotional spend, we can actually see upside in revenue and margin. But as I said in the earlier question, the pruning and SKU rationalization related to supply chain reinvention is, I would say, it's diminishing. It's getting smaller. So as we head into next year \u2013 and you asked about the trend, I think it will be less of a negative impact for next year.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Mostly, David \u2013 facts are a very powerful thing, and so as we go to our customers with the data on ROI related to the spending with them, we have a much easier conversation, a much better story, and we're working together because both of us want to get better returns for the money that's being invested. So it's actually making for a much more robust conversation. And as Brian said, we're really getting a lot of learning as we get into this.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just a follow-up comment is that some companies and consultants are increasingly sharing this dream that better analytics are now coming about that you can shift the spending from lower ROI promotions to higher ROI, and with some lead-time, you may not have that volume trade-off that more blunt shifts have made in the past. I don't know if you believe that, come 2018, say, or by 2018, you could be getting better at this, such that we see net revenue improvement without the volume hit.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, we're seeing that, David. And there, clearly, are some areas where we have low hanging fruit. I would say, the developing markets, the emerging markets which still have a fair amount of trade spend, that's where it's toughest, because the data is hardest to get at. But some of the more developed markets \u2013 what you're saying makes sense, we're going to find areas of distorting spend and moving it to the right places, improves the ROI and could be in that positive on the top-line.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Strycula of UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, and good morning. Question for Brian. I wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the split of margin expansion in the fourth quarter between gross and SG&A, just because the last two quarters we've seen a little bit heavier lean on SG&A for expansion. That question, and then I have a follow-up.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, I guess, Steven, I'd go back. I mean, when we talked, I guess it was at CAGNY, we said longer term the biggest lever from here to our targets in 2018 is really gross margin. We would say that's still true. The work that we're doing, the line of sight we have, the programs in place, getting to the Lines of the Future targets we talked about \u2013 we're at 50 today and we've still got more to do. That's absolutely where we're headed. I would say, in the short-term, the trend you're seeing right now is probably more consistent with what you'll see, that it'll be a mix. It will be \u2013 no one quarter is going to be easy to sort of predict, and we're not going to provide that level of granularity. But I think you'll see more SG&A and a little bit less on the gross margin in the fourth quarter.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And how should we think about the cadence or the growth rate of U.S. or North American business, just given that biscuits were a little bit weaker in the second quarter, feels like it got a little bit better in the third quarter, and we're just lapping a really challenging year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. So just trying to think through how much is self-control, how much is a little bit of new innovation kicking in against a tough comp.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","We actually think, Steven, a lot of it is under our control. Historically, the category has benefited from our innovation and from the muscle of our DSD selling organization. And we're \u2013 we believe that continuing to innovate, support the franchises, and leverage our DSD muscle is going to allow us to get that category growing again. So we've got a sizable amount of continued A&C investment. We're continuing to innovate behind ideas like GOOD THiNS and belVita Bites and Chips Ahoy! Thins, which are driving some very nice incremental growth. And good programming with our retail partners. And so together, we would expect that to help bring that category back to a more robust rate of growth.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Steven.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi...","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","...Irene and Brian. had a question about the gap between your margins in developed markets versus developing markets. You've boosted \u2013 most of the margin improvement has come from North America and Europe, now at 20%, and the developing markets are in the low-10%s and maybe teens, but I'm just wondering, if you think back today versus maybe a few years ago, do you feel like you still have the same pricing power in those developing markets, given the slowdown in macroeconomic conditions? Maybe the competition has gotten tougher, and what do you think you have you to do in order to boost margins in those markets, given also the investment needs for growth?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","So, Rob, we still are getting good pricing, not as much as we were able to in the emerging markets, but the truth of the matter is that our revenue growth in the emerging markets, as Brian mentioned, were up about 2%. About five points of that is pricing. And so we're continuing to get pricing in these markets. As I mentioned earlier, we're looking to be a lot smarter in how we execute that pricing, looking much more to use price pack architecture, smaller sizes, economy sizes to deliver that pricing. And so, we're still getting pricing. The facts are, if you look at our margin performance for our emerging markets, we're getting up to the level of our peers. There continues to be an important component of overhead scale leverage there, so that it's critical for us to fuel the growth there to be able to leverage and amortize that infrastructure.","And certainly in our developed markets, we're \u2013 in Europe, I think we're probably among the top of our peer group. In the U.S., we're getting much more in that top quartile. So, I think our margins, overall, in aggregate we've made sizable margin expansion, 220 basis points in the quarter, 260 basis points year-to-date. And it's coming from a balance of the work that we're doing in both our developed and our emerging markets. And, again, pricing is \u2013 we feel quite confident in our ability to price smartly in these emerging markets, and the results you're seeing reflect that.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","And there's a bit of a structural question around \u2013 as you look at the initiatives, the transformation work, whether it's supply chain reinvention, whether it's shared services, I mean, we sequence a lot of that activity and effort on the larger opportunities in the developed markets. So they're a bit behind in terms of executing on transformation, some of that margin expansion opportunity is still to come. And, as you know, we've invested, in many cases, ahead of the growth and we've chose to stick with those investments and count on the fact that those emerging markets will come back and be a nice lever for us when growth returns.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Irene, I'd like to ask about your vision for profit contribution in the emerging markets maybe a bit differently. I think the year-to-date expansion has been pretty striking and it seems to be maybe evolving a bit different relative to your base plan a few years ago, which rested more on holding margins flat and driving profit through a faster top-line. I mean, assuming the category growth does remain challenged, how are your options now evolving to address the cost base and overheads in LatAm and EEMEA going forward? Maybe follow Asia's lead.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.","Very good question, and that's exactly what our intent is, is a lot of the tools that are our Asian team is using are available in our other regions. We start with EEMEA is inheriting some of the business. We announced that we're breaking up our EEMEA region, putting some of the business into Asia Pacific and some of the business into Europe, and that will inherently give us much more leverage on the Middle Eastern business and the Africa business and the Eastern Europe business. That is a part of that. So that will help actually both Europe and Asia Pacific, and basically we'll see progress there.","With respect to Latin America, a lot of the tools that we're using, the base productivity shifting our product mix, very disciplined focus on overheads are the same tools that we're using and those will continue to be available in Latin America. And we're going to use those as we continue our margin expansion there. So the work that we've done in \u2013 we're very pleased with the progress we've made in Asia Pacific. A lot of it is using the very same tools that we've used elsewhere in the world, zero-based budgeting, focusing on streamlining our overheads, as Brian mentioned, moving to shared services which actually will start to affect the emerging markets more in a more pronounced way as we head into 2017. So we see the opportunities in our other emerging market geographies, similar to what we've done in Asia Pacific. But we're very pleased with the performance in Asia Pacific.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great.

Please go ahead, sir.","Shep Dunlap - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.

You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you, Shep. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to say that 2018 is off to a good start. We have improving top line momentum, as well as continued margin and EPS expansion. Specifically, we delivered an organic net revenue growth of 2.4%, which was underpinned by positive volume growth and pricing. We also benefited from the timing of Easter and Chinese New Year. In addition, several of our Power Brands performed well, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, Oreo, and Milka. Each was up mid to high-single digit.","On the bottom line, our adjusted operating income margin expanded to 16.7%, driven by lower SG&A costs and productivity savings, while the adjusted EPS increased nearly 10% at constant currency. We are also encouraged by snacking category growth, especially in emerging markets, where we generate about 40% of our net revenue. While we certainly have opportunities for improvement, we're moving in the right direction with competitive advantages that set us apart from many of our peers.","First, we have a strong stable of iconic brands. Second, our geographic footprint is favorably balanced with about three-quarters of our revenues coming from outside of North America. And third, we maintain leading positions in snacking, where global category growth trends are improving. With these powerful assets, I remain confident that our company is well positioned to succeed.","As I outlined at CAGNY in February, I believe the key to unlocking more value for shareholders is based on a couple of simple concepts. First, we need to put the consumer at the center of everything we do. That means we need to evolve our understanding of when and why consumers snack and how we best deliver on those needs. And second, we must execute with excellence every day.","Over the past few years, our focus has been on significant margin improvement through restructuring. And as we've implemented changes, we have opportunities to improve how we function on a day-to-day basis. These two simple mandates are critical to delivering our 2018 plan. And they will underpin the strategic framework to deliver further sustainable growth over the long term that we will talk about in September.","So let me now illustrate with a few examples from the quarter, where we're winning in the marketplace. I'll start in Europe, where we delivered excellent results in both biscuits and chocolates, driven by strong volume mix. Across the region, we continue to build our fast-growing chocobakery platform, which is up more than 20%. Chocobakery is a franchise that uniquely leverages our strength, because it lives at the crossroads between our iconic chocolates and biscuit brands. Combining Milka or Cadbury Chocolate with Oreo cookies or Ritz crackers is a consumer proposition that is hard to beat. In addition, our European team executed well on our Easter plans and expanded our gifting and premium platforms in many key markets.","Switching to the UK, our chocolate business grew double digits. And here also, our chocobakery platform continued to shine, supported by the launch of Cadbury Freddo Biscuits. In Russia, our business was up mid-teens, with strong results both in biscuits and in chocolates. In fact, our chocolate business recently achieved the number one position in this growing market. It was fueled by recent Alpen Gold Dark and Milka Dark new product launches, which increased our market share by nearly 3 percentage points.","I also want to highlight the great progress of our Cocoa Life sustainable sourcing program, which is especially important to many of our consumers in Europe. We know that as we grow our business, we can also grow the positive impact we have on people and on the planet, and Cocoa Life is a great example of doing exactly that.","Cocoa Life is a holistic and integrated program that not only has helped to increase cocoa yields, but it's also helping farmers in cocoa communities achieve sustainable livelihoods. By the end of last year, we reached more than 120,000 cocoa farmers in nearly 1,100 communities in six origin markets. And what's more, 35% of our cocoa is now sustainably sourced.","So just last week, we announced that our Milka brand in Europe will join Cocoa Life, with chocolate tablets displaying the Cocoa Life logo starting from August. Milka will now join other brands that contain sustainably sourced Cocoa Life cocoa, including Cadbury Dairy Milk in the UK and Ireland, C\u00f4te d'Or in Belgium and France, and Freia and Marabou in the Nordics, and Oreo cookies across Europe.","In addition to Europe, our emerging markets also performed well this quarter, building on the positive trends from the second half of last year. Volumes increased and we gained market share in several important markets. And once again, India was a standout, with revenue up double digits behind strong volume gains. We also increased distribution across the country and coupled that with improved in-store execution and a number of successful new product launches, such as Cadbury 5Star and Lickables, which all drove market share gains. And the biscuit growth also continued to be strong, which was led by Oreo.","In China, we delivered mid-single-digit growth, bolstered by improved sales execution, a good Chinese New Year, and strong results from our recent Oreo relaunch. In addition, China's e-commerce net revenues doubled in the quarter. This contributed to another quarter of healthy growth in our global e-commerce net revenues. They were up more than 40%.","Southeast Asia delivered its tenth consecutive quarter of growth, up high single digits. It was led by a strong performance in Indonesia, driven by Oreo innovation and route-to-market expansion. And in Latin America, we delivered mid-single-digit growth in Mexico, led by strength in candy, while Brazil biscuits improved, driven by success in our chocobakery business with products such as our new Lacta cookies.","However, these highlights were tempered by our performance in North America. We acknowledge the challenging dynamics in the market, as you're hearing from other CPG companies. But I would emphasize that we are bullish on the long-term strength of our North American franchise, and remind you that it represents only 25% of our net revenues.","The fundamentals in the region got better last quarter, with positive volume growth and sequential improvements in biscuit consumption and market share. In fact, the demand for our brands was strong. That said, our supply chain has had challenges effectively meeting all that demand. And this along with our gum mix and overall trades destocking drove the weaker revenue in North America. As a consequence, higher operating costs are impacting our margins.","I'm pleased to say the North American team is squarely focused on improving execution, and our customer service levels have significantly improved over the past couple of months. I would also note that we are starting to see the competitive advantage that our DSD system provides, and we are increasingly confident in its ability to contribute to share gains as our service levels improve. As we said in our last call, we expect gradual progress in North America to continue over the next few quarters.","With that, I will hand it over to Brian to review our quarterly performance in more detail.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Dirk, and good afternoon.","We're pleased with our top line growth in Q1, as we saw improved momentum across much of our business. Organic net revenue increased 2.4%, driven primarily by volume. Three of our four regions delivered solid profitable growth, with strength in Europe and AMEA. Our top line grew on a reported basis by 5.5%, as the benefits of a weaker U.S. dollar versus the euro and British pound are now providing a tailwind to our growth. Power Brand performance remains the driver of our organic net revenue growth, delivering a 2.8% increase, with strong results from brands like Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, and Oreo.","Continuing the trends we saw in the second half of last year, emerging markets performed well, increasing 5.5%, with a good balance of volume and pricing. Given this represents nearly 40% of our revenues, this is good news for us.","On balance, we're seeing positive pricing for the global business. Increased prices in emerging markets are more than offsetting some negative pricing in developed markets. In Europe, minor price actions have helped contribute to good volume growth. And in North America, pricing is slightly down but consistent with the market dynamics we've seen for the past year or so.","On a regional basis for the quarter, Europe's organic net revenue increased 4.7%. This volume-driven growth was broad-based, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits in the majority of the region. We did see a benefit from Easter phasing that will reverse in Q2, but the business is performing well. AMEA posted growth of 3.6%, with double-digit growth in India, strength in Southeast Asia, and solid results in China, which benefited from a good Chinese New Year and the timing of the holiday. Latin America grew 2.2% behind a mid-single-digit growth in Mexico, strength in Brazil biscuits, and currency-driven pricing in Argentina. North America declined 1.8%, driven mostly by trade inventory reductions and gum weakness.","Now let's review our margin performance. We delivered a 20 basis point improvement in adjusted OI margins at 16.7%. These results were primarily driven by ongoing SG&A reductions. Gross margins were pressured by three key factors: unfavorable mix, primarily driven by gum weakness; higher commodity costs with benefits from lower cocoa pricing expected to positively impact our second half margins; and higher supply chain costs in North America. While the mix challenge will continue, the other two pressures should subside as we move into the second half of the year. These dynamics, along with our strong net productivity plans, give us confidence that gross margins will improve as we move through the year.","On a regional basis, cost execution drove margin improvements in three of four regions. Europe margins grew 50 basis points to 19.2%, AMEA increased by 150 basis points to 16%, and Latin America increased 270 basis points to 18.5%. North America was down 210 basis points to 18.7%, as we incurred higher supply chain costs including freight and logistics inflation.","Now let me provide some category highlights. The snacking category continues to show some encouraging momentum, building on what we saw in the second half of 2017. In fact, growth from snacking was approximately 6%. Adjusting for the timing of the Easter holiday season however, we estimate underlying consumption growth of approximately 3.4%.","Our biscuits business grew 2.7% with strength in France, Brazil, Russia, and China, and positive growth in the U.S. Approximately 75% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category. In chocolate, our global business remained strong, growing 4.8%. The UK, India, and Russia all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Approximately 70% of our revenue grew or held share in this category. Gum and candy was flat, as the gum business remains challenged. About 15% of our year-to-date revenue in this business gained or held share.","Turning to earnings per share, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS growth, up nearly 10% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by interest cost favorability, the impact of share repurchases, and our operating performance. We returned more than $800 million in capital to shareholders in total. We repurchased $500 million in stock and paid approximately $300 million in cash dividends, as we increased our quarterly dividend by 16%.","Turning to free cash flow, although Q1 is typically a negative cash flow period for us, driven by our business seasonality, we delivered positive free cash flow in the quarter. The improved cash flow was partially driven by the timing related to our year-end working capital balances. Our team remains focused on generating approximately $2.8 billion in free cash flow for 2018.","Overall, we're maintaining our outlook for the full year. We're encouraged by our top line progress, as both our categories and our revenue growth are a bit better than we had anticipated coming into the year, but it's still early as this is just one quarter. However, we would say that the cost environment is tougher than we planned. That's especially true in North America, with the rest of our business well positioned on margins. We're still confident that our overall gross margins will improve as we move through the year, and we remain committed to delivering adjusted OI margins of approximately 17%, as well as double-digit adjusted EPS growth.","You'll see in our presentation that we've lowered our view on the expected tax rate to the low 20% range for the year. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect top line growth to be higher than Q1, as we lap the negative impact of the malware incident from last year. I'd also remind you that the second quarter is seasonally more challenged in terms of margins. This year will be also impacted by continued commodity cost headwinds and cost pressure in North America. Given these dynamics, we expect Q2 adjusted OI margins to be sequentially lower than Q1, but in line with our expectations for how the year would play out.","Now, let me turn it back to Dirk for some concluding remarks.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. So, I would say Q1 performance was good. We saw improved category growth and consumption trends, and we had solid performance from our Power Brands. We're optimistic, but it's early in the year. And we still have work to do as we focus on executing on our 2018 plan with excellence.","As it relates to the bigger picture, we feel encouraged about many of the trends we're seeing in some of our biggest markets outside of the U.S. With an international business that represents 75% of our net revenues, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends over the coming quarters.","Before I conclude, I would like to update you quickly on the status of our strategic review. As I've told you a few times, we've taken a fresh outside-in look at everything we do. We want to best position ourselves to generate sustainable value creation in the years to come. We are making good progress with the process, and we remain on target to complete this work at the end of the summer. So we'll share more details with you at that time.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good afternoon, everybody.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. I was hoping we could start, I guess, with North America just because despite modest expectations coming in, it's probably the segment that was still weaker than most had modeled. I was hoping you could provide, I guess, a bit more detail on why, I guess, organic sales would have decelerated sequentially in the region, even though we're almost a year out from the initial sort of malware incident. And my sense that with respect to some \u2013 I think you made a comment around some inventory deloading, I guess that I was under the impression that that was harder to sort of get into a problem with, with a DSD organization, where there's not as much sort of inventory sitting around. So hopefully that'd be the first part of North America.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks, Andrew. Well, before I go a little bit deeper, I would like to say that we feel strongly about our North American business. We think it's well positioned for long-term profitable growth, and the reason that I'm saying that is, first of all, we are the number one player in the biscuit market. I think we have great brands with Oreo, Velveeta, Chips Ahoy!, we do have that differentiation from DSD, and we are improving our supply chain capability and performance, we're including recent investments.","And we have new leadership in place with Glen Walter, and we are quite pleased with how much progress he's making in the operations. We do see the challenging environment. There are retailer pressures, as you know. There are changing channel dynamics, shifting more of the business into different channels, and everybody has talked about this higher logistics cost. But we've seen very positive signs as it relates to the consumer in the market. The spending is strong. The snacking categories have been improving. Our consumption is increasing above the market. And we see no real dramatic change in the pricing environment. So Q1, the pricing change is similar to the rest of 2017.","So first of all, why is the top line growth negative still? The first reason is you have to see with mix. We have a mix between gum and biscuits mainly. And the gum business is still in decline. Secondly, the retailers are decreasing inventories. And the reason why we are also experiencing that is they're switching to automatic systems. So, our DSD group or sales force cannot necessarily influence that. And thirdly, the pricing, while similar in trend, is still going down roughly about half a percentage point.","So, pricing-wise as I said, that's in line with what we've seen in the past years. But \u2013 and we also did some trade promotional spending in a few isolated spaces that had pretty good returns on it. And we're seeing as a consequence biscuit consumption and share improvement, so our consumption is up in the market. We don't quite yet see that in revenue because of what I was explaining.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","So those are largely the reasons I would say that we still are seeing that lag in our revenue.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. One for Brian as a follow-up would just be, I think on the last call, you had mentioned that your expectation would be that overall gross margin would expand for the full year. Would that still be your expectation? Obviously, I think it would be more second-half loaded at this point, but would that still be a reasonable expectation? And if so, kind of what's the key driver there?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","It is, Andrew. We still expect that. We fully expected lower margins in the first half as we built our plans and rolled them out. In the quarter, what I would say the drivers of gross margin were we had some unfavorable mix, and Dirk talked about gum on a global basis. That's one of the challenges, it's higher profitability, as you know. I think that'll continue. That's a headwind that we knew about coming into the year, and it's about what we expected.","Commodity cost is really a timing challenge given the hedge positions we had, given inventory levels in cocoa especially, but also in dairy and packaging. And as you know, we've been raising prices in the cheese business because of dairy inflation. And we'll begin to sort of lap or get ahead of the inflation in the second quarter. And then the higher supply chain costs in North America. And again, as Dirk said, I mean, I think we believe we'll see sequential improvement there as we work on supply chain cost as we get ahead of freight inflation that you're seeing across the business.","So, I'd say the biggest driver is the expectation. And frankly, we know it, because of where we are in hedge positions. But commodities in the second half will be significantly better than the first half, and then again, getting ahead on supply chain costs in North America. And we're making progress there and we feel good about that.","So, maybe another way to think about gross margins, I'd say, on an aggregate total global basis, pricing, net productivity, and volume leverage were contributors to improving gross margins. So they helped gross margins in the quarter. And then the mix and commodity costs were pressures to gross margin in the quarter. And even though net productivity was a help and positive, it was lower than expected because of the North America dynamic. So...","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","...we do see that gross margins should improve sequentially as we move through the year, and for the total year, we still believe they should be up.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks to you both.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, Bryan.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to ask about you had very good margin expansion in Latin America and AMEA. And I'm assuming some of that is because you had good organic net revenue growth. You had some volume leverage, sales leverage. But can you just talk about the factors there that are sort of helping to improve the margin? And maybe as we're thinking about going forward, was there something about the first quarter that was just unusually favorable? Or if you continue to sort of taste that similar sort of organic sales growth, would we expect that type of margin expansion through the balance of the year?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Bryan, I would say in general, volume is helpful in margins, and it was \u2013 it's good to see some volume growth back in the business. I think when it gets down to it, it's really about executing on that productivity, executing on our net \u2013 our SG&A programs across the company, but especially in these markets. As you know, some of our supply chain work has been \u2013 it was initially more focused in the developed markets, in the latter stages, was more in AMEA and Latin America. And you start to see some of that really begin to benefit the business, and we expect some of that to continue. So, I think the volume was good. And obviously, there's a bit of a benefit from Easter and some timing and phasing in the quarter, but that is a help to the P&L and a help to the margin rates.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you. And just one quick follow-up to Andrew's question, consumption in North America was up in the first quarter. Could you just give us a sense for where consumption was versus sort of your organic net decline?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","The biscuit category was up 2.2% in Q1. That's about 1.2% higher than in Q4, and we held share and our consumption increased by 2.5%. So contrast that with our decline of 1.8% in our revenue.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Dirk, I'm sure one of the things that you were looking at in your strategic review is what to do with some businesses that perhaps are not core or may be not contributing to growth. And as we look at gum, it's been in freefall, I hope that's not too strong a term for this company, for years now. It's really only brought up on earnings calls when explaining why North America isn't doing maybe as well as expected. And so it's almost an afterthought, it feels, to at least some of us on the outside. What would it take for Mondel\u0113z to keep this business rather than divesting it? And if it does decide to keep it, what needs to happen to turn this business around, because it feels like it's been a challenge for the company for so many years at this point?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","I'll take it, Ken. I'd say, as you see in the quarter, it's down low single digits for the company. We're not seeing signs of improvement in developed markets. We've tried, obviously, innovation, and we've taken some cost out of the business. We've invested in advertising and consumer spending. Emerging markets, the gum business is actually up high single digits with volume-based growth, and there's some good markets like Turkey, Brazil, South Africa that are contributing to that in a good way. So there are some pockets of improvement that we feel pretty good about.","It is \u2013 as you would know, it's relatively small. It's about 7% of revenue now. Obviously, good profit margins, and I think one of the challenges is, it gives us scale in some important markets. And as we think about the strategic decision or what we might do in the long term, we obviously have to consider that. There would obviously be stranded costs. There's obviously a short-term dilution associated with the transaction.","So, I think it's one where it's obviously going to be one of the topics that we spend some time on as we do our strategic work, but again, it's in the short term. I think you'll see some innovation in a few markets this year. I think we're generally optimistic about some of those. We're taking actions to reduce the cost structure, given the growth profile. And as we've talked about, we continue to shift resources, focus to candy and to mints, which I think are obviously markets that are growing faster and have equally attractive margins for the business. So it's a complex process, and I think it's one that we are working on.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, everybody, so two quick questions. The first one, you mentioned that the snack category is now reaccelerating, which is encouraging. Could you give us some color on where and maybe why that's happening?","And then I guess the second question is, you're expecting a strengthening of the top line next quarter, and yet you've kept the guidance for the full year for organic revenue growth at 1% to 2%. Are you actively expecting a deceleration in the back half, perhaps against tougher comps, or are you just being cautious at this point? We'd just love to hear some commentary about whether there's something in the back half that might make that tougher. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thank you, Alexia. I'll do the first part and then Brian will take the second part of your question. So overall, the snacks category improved by 3.4% in the first quarter, and that excludes the Easter timing. In the second half, the comparison will be a little bit more difficult because last year, we already saw an improvement of the category in the second half. So we are pretty thoughtful about our targets and the top line. We need to see North America stabilize. And as I said, the market there also is showing some acceleration.","As I look at the world as it relates to snacking, I would say that the emerging markets are continued and accelerated. They are now growing high single digits. And then the developed markets also are now low single digits, but also an improvement versus 2017, so we see it a little bit across the board. Europe had some very strong growth, the U.S., as I talked about. We also saw good results in China. We saw India doing quite well, Mexico, as we talked about. So it's sort of, at this stage, a trough developed in emerging markets that we are seeing the improvement of the growth of the snacking market.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Alexia, on the total year outlook as it relates to revenue, I think we are obviously maintaining our outlook for the year at 1% to 2%. I'd say we would acknowledge some potential upside to the top line if the trends that we're seeing continue. As Dirk just talked about, category growth rates and our top line trajectory are both a bit above what we would have expected. But we want to really watch the global category growth as we normalize for Easter and move through Ramadan. And then our North America business, we want to stabilize that as well.","So I think to your question around the second half, I think the second half, it won't be negative. I think we will see positive growth in the second half, and we'll lap, as we said, a little bit more challenging comps in the second half. So in general, we're just being a little bit thoughtful and maybe prudent on the top line, and we'll look at it as we move through the year.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good evening.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, Chris.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I just had a question for you, a bit of a follow-on. In terms of this quarter and the benefit from Easter, how much of that \u2013 can you give us an idea of how much some of that shifts between 2Q and 1Q around that phenomenon?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","For our revenue, it's in the range of about 50 basis points that moves from \u2013 that you would adjust the first quarter growth by.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. And just a follow-up question then on, there was a comment about the timing of SG&A spending. So just a general question about SG&A and the degree to which there are some savings in there. But certainly, that was depressed a bit for any reason in the quarter, so I'm curious about that. And then how you balanced promotional spending and A&C spending in the quarter, was there a move more towards promotional spending versus A&C? I was just curious how that balance went for the quarter.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Look, I think we put some trade promotional spend in play in both North America and in Europe. You would have seen that's one of the contributors to the pricing dynamic. I think we feel pretty good about, as you look at the consumption results in both of those regions, that it seemed to pay back good returns, and we'll continue to look at that.","I'd say on A&C, no real change to our posture. I'd say on the total year, we expect to be about flat. I think it looks a little down in the first quarter, and that's mostly driven by phasing of how we would have booked those costs over the last year in 2017. So I'd say relatively flat on A&C and a little bit more on trade promotional spend, and you saw how it played out in consumption in the top line.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you for that.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","You got it, Chris.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thank you. Hey, Dirk, I guess two questions. One was, I think you made a comment that Glen Walter was making progress at Nabisco and that you were pleased with the progress. Can you give me some more specifics as to what he's \u2013 like the top two or three things that he's focused on? That would be helpful. And then also, I think there's a comment here that delivery and service costs will start to ease in the second half of the year. Can you give me a sense of what's driving that easing of pressure? Thanks.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yes, so it started really with the malware disruption last summer, which threw us off, and we were several weeks without really having a clear view on where our inventory was and how much we were selling to our clients. On top of that, we've had issues in our North American plants as it relates to waste. We were having too much waste, and so they were not really running as expected. Then the third thing that came in there is that we saw, as I mentioned, the demand increasing. So those three factors were the ones that influenced us at the end of last year and also still in the beginning of this year.","We're returning to good service. We're back where we should be. We also have reestablished normal inventory. We did that by incurring extra costs. So things we have to do was increase manpower but also go into more over time just to make sure that we assured the right service, we had the right inventories, and we have solved our system problems.","The issue that we had with our clients at the end of last year resulted in some returns and a charge of some allowances since we didn't provide the right service into the first quarter of this year. And then on top of that, you've seen the higher freight and logistics cost that we talked about. So we're back, but the costs are still there. They're improving. We still need to get our plant performance under control.","So, when I said that Glen is doing well, the first thing that he was focused on is make sure that we get our customer service back in line and that we are delivering what we should be delivering, which is happening. The second thing he is doing is focusing on our performance in our plants and making sure that we get that improved. And the third thing that he is working hard on is to make sure that our plans, as it relates to our brands, are clear, and that we assure an excellent execution during the rest of the year. So those are the three things that he's working on. He's very operationally-oriented, and I can clearly see the progress we're making.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And what's driving the cost improvement on service and freight?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","The cost improvement on service and freight, well, the one thing that we will certainly do is improve our performance and our waste in our plants. The freight and logistics, we are working on negotiating better using private shipment as much as we can and switching to rail, but we will still see an effect of the cost of freight and logistics.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thank you.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great, thank you and good evening.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, David.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Wanted to ask a little bit more about Europe. Organic revenue is up very strong in the quarter, but I don't think you said what the Easter impact was in Europe. I think you answered Growe's question and said it was about 50 basis points to the full company in the first quarter comes out of second quarter. But specifically to Europe, can you quantify that number? And then really where I want to go with this is I want to just understand that 4.7% and how you think about the kind of ongoing growth rate in Europe.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yes. So the organic net revenue growth that we saw in Europe was close to 5%. We saw an Easter effect in there, so I would say that we are in low-single-digit as it relates to our real growth. The volume and mix continues to be quite solid, and so we also continued to gain share in several of our markets. And the reason why that is happening is that we are having solid execution and we're having very good growth opportunities in particularly in two areas. One is this segment that we call chocobakery, which is sort of in between our chocolate and our biscuit brands, and that is growing over 20%, and seasonals, where we are every year executing better on our seasonal range. And so that has driven a margin expansion of about 50 basis points.","Obviously, if you dive a little bit deeper, it's the chocolate category, which is doing or growing better than the biscuit category, although we're very happy with our biscuit performance, too, we've seen quite good volume mix there. That category is now high-single-digit growth. If you exclude Easter, we are probably mid-single-digit, and our share is increasing, particularly in the UK, which is our biggest market, but also in a market like Russia, for instance.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, David. As you would expect, Europe is our biggest region impacted by Easter, and it's in the range of 2.5 points of the growth was driven by Easter.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And that just comes straight out of the second quarter for modeling purposes?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. One last for me, it's just on the inflation. Can you quantify, Brian, your expectation for inflation for 2018? And then, I think I heard you right that you said cocoa would actually be favorable in the back half of the year. Can you marry that up with the spot cocoa market and the very dramatic inflation that we see in cocoa prices?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. So in terms of commodities in general, I mean, as I said, they were unfavorable versus the prior year in the first quarter. Most of that came from higher dairy, higher packaging costs. And as we said, one of the drivers of our gross margin weakness was this dynamic. We've been pricing for the dairy inflation, and again, we get through that as we're getting through the middle of the year.","As it relates to cocoa, our all-in cost for the first quarter net of hedges was up from versus the prior year, so that would be different than obviously what you see in the spot market. And that's driven by hedges that we've had in place from last year, and obviously inventory we entered the year with. We do see the cocoa costs helping in the second half, but it's still a little bit of a challenge in the second quarter given hedges, again, that were put in place last year, so wouldn't necessarily match up with what you see in the spot market. So, it's really all about the timing of when we put hedges on, and we've got pretty much the rest of the year locked, and we know what that is, and we know it's going to be favorable year over year and favorable sequentially.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you, I'll pass it along.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon, thanks for the question.","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hey, John.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Hi, John.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Dirk, I wanted to ask you about chocolate. The market share performance is 70% where you're holding or gaining. I think it's the best you've had dating back to the Mondel\u0113z-Kraft days. So can you speak a bit more to what's underpinning this between normalized price gaps, new distribution, maybe the new innovation? And then with the new innovation, which is presumably at a positive mix, is the portfolio's complexion changing to an extent where you can preserve these market share gains as you go to the next upswing in cost inflation and pricing?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yes, so obviously, Europe is our biggest chocolate market. And in relation to the question before, I've gone through that. So pricing was pretty good for us as it relates to chocolate. The category itself, as I talked about, grew about 11.9%. If you exclude Easter, we think it's probably 5%, and our revenue growth, which, of course, has a lag versus the consumption growth, was around 5% \u2013 4.8%.","So yes, it is true that this is probably our highest maintaining and\/or increasing share, which was 65% in Q4. I would say the reasons. I need to go a little bit around the world to give you the reasons why that is happening. In the UK, we have very strong execution. As I talked about in the previous call, we're sponsoring the Premiership. We launched a new campaign, and we've seen share increases there. So we feel that that is something that is going to continue. We've repositioned the brand, and that seems to be working quite well for us.","If I go to India, which is another big chocolate market for us, where we have two-thirds of the market, our shares are increasing quite strongly there. And that is a mixture of new launches that we've done, something called 5Star 3D or some new varieties on our Silk, which is our premium range. We're also getting some traction on a product we call Lickables, which is a combination of chocolate and a toy. And we're also expanding our distribution there because of the potential that we still have in the traditional trade. So that's giving us double-digit increases.","If I switch to Russia, which is another big chocolate market, there we're also are gaining several share points. That is driven by the launch of two brands of dark chocolate at the end of last year, Alpen Gold and Milka. So just like in the UK and India, I would think that the Russia momentum is also going to continue. And then we have \u2013 and another big market is Australia for us, again, more than 1%, almost 2 share points gain. There, I would say it's driven by strong Easter execution. It's probably not that repetitive. I think we just executed well, and the market there is doing well for the first part of the year, where in general it's a slower market.","And then the other big market that we have but there we are losing share, that's in Brazil, because there's very aggressive competitive promotions. The category is growing largely by price increases, but there we have lost some market share. And that's the only market of the big chocolate markets where we are present that I would say that we are losing share. And in the others that I talked about, I do believe we have momentum and that we will be able to maintain that for the rest of the year.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, John.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","I would just say if you look over the last two years, maybe two and a half years, we've been pretty close to 60% \u2013 70% gaining, holding and gaining share mostly in this category. So once we lap the pricing that was required with the last round of cocoa inflation three years ago, I think we've been in great position and we've seen good momentum in chocolate across the board.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great, thanks for that, and, Brian, just a quick one on gross margin outlook. Is there anything that's impactful for you in 2018 in terms of transactional FX?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Not really for the most part. As you would expect, we have our exposures hedged on the transactional side and most of the year is already locked in. So it's incorporated in our outlook, and I'd say it's relatively minor.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for your time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good evening. I don't want to beat the dead horse on chocolate in Europe in particular, but you mentioned that your cocoa inputs were going to be down the second half. We see commodity prices for cocoa up lately, up significantly or kind of bouncing from the bottom. Are you in a position to be taking perhaps less price than the competition, perhaps not having to lead in your pricing like you did in the past, and perhaps in a good spot with your own contracted costs?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Look, we're not going to get into specifics around what we might do on pricing, David. I think again, we feel like we're in a good position in terms of our cocoa costs as we look at least the rest of this year. I think as you see, we're managing the chocolate business for growth right now. But again, we feel like we've got the right cost position, and we'll manage that as we go through the year, but nothing specific on pricing.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And, Dirk, you've talked about executing with excellence, and I think people have in their mind the U.S. DSD in the wake of the malware issue as an area of potential improvement in the near term. But you probably are talking about some other potential wins there, some other areas of near-term improvement that you have in mind. What other areas would you point to for an opportunity there?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","I would say, in general, it's the shift in focus that we are going to go through as a company, where in the last three, four years, we have been very focused on our margin improvement. And we've restructured, we've closed plants, we've revamped our organization, we went through MBS. And so that takes a lot of energy in a company. And we've done well, but now we're getting to the end of that, and so we are \u2013 as a company, we see the potential now to really start focusing more on the relationship with our clients, the execution in the stores, and so on. So that, I would say, is one of the biggest shift.","As I think about other area that is, for us, possible, one of the areas that I talked about is waste. We have a lot of waste in two areas, in the plants, mainly in North America, but also commercial waste, meaning that we have inventory that we need to destroy sometimes or we don't execute as well on the plans that we had, and that leads to some lost of opportunities. So, that's another area where I would expect us to do much better going forward.","And then in general, in emerging markets, it's a game of gaining distribution and being excellent in thousands of stores. And that is sort of a day-to-day execution, you almost have to do it like an army, and we are \u2013 continue to increase our focus on that. And India, as an example, shows that if we do that well and we compare it with increase of distribution, that we can have quite some progress from that. Those would be three examples of where I see excellence in execution really coming through.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much. Dirk, I just had a question regarding Power Brands versus non-Power Brands, and I think specifically, I've heard you say before as you go through the strategic review like there may be areas and brands where you might want to lean into a little bit per se that maybe aren't your larger Power Brands. And I'm just curious, is that \u2013 I guess the direct question is like why does that logic work if your Power Brands continue to outgrow your non-Power Brands, number one? And number two, if a large amount of the capital allocation we've seen over the last three years restructuring program goes into these lines in the future, why not scale back some of the kind of secondary, tertiary brands and just go all Power Brands?","Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah, I would say by deciding on focusing on the Power Brands, what we've done is we've distorted some of the spending. And so internally, our portfolio now, you've on one hand the Power Brands, which are doing well, but we have also the non-Power Brands, which are probably declining more than they would if they would get a little bit of support. And some of these, and I would probably call it the tail brands at the moment, that category, we can still split up various brands that are really old, and it's difficult to revamp them.","There's other brands, which are usually very important in the different countries around the world that we have, and that because of our focus on Power Brands, we have neglected a little bit. And those brands still have a lot of potential, and what we want to do is reshift a little bit more of the spending of the Power Brands back into these, what I would call, local heritage brands, and where we have done that modernizing the packaging, modernizing the communication, using much more digital, we have seen quite interesting growth. And so as a consequence, we're starting to see a little bit of better growth coming out of that group of brands.","So we're expecting to explore further that direction. It still will mean that we are going to remain very focused on our Power Brands, but we believe that there are ways in which we cannot have the same decline in the rest of the portfolio and get some growth out of some of the brands there. And the overall mix we see is going to be better if we do that.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then a quick one for you, Brian. In terms of the KDP transaction, I think you mentioned before that it should be somewhat accretive. Is that baked into your guidance for this year? Or should we expect accretion from that transaction on top of current guidance, whenever that deal closes? Thanks.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.","Yeah. Look, we said it's accretive in the first full year, which, as we expect that, that would be half of it this year, half of it next year. I would say, it's immaterial to the current outlook. It's not that much of an accretion that you would see it in the numbers, but it is slightly accretive.","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Super.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question and answer session.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations, for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO, and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and today's slides, which are available on our website, MondelezInternational.com.","As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the Cautionary Statements and Risk Factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","With that, I'll now turn over the call to Irene.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dexter, and good morning.","Over the past few years, we've laid out our vision to be the best snacking company in the world. Our advantaged platform provides with us the potential to be among the fastest-growing consumer companies, with substantial margin upside and strong EPS growth, while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. Since we began this journey three years ago in the face of a very challenging environment, we've taken several significant actions to further strengthen our advantaged platform and create sustainable value for shareholders. Our strong results in 2015 reflect our continued progress, with the year playing out essentially as we planned, with very strong margin expansion in our developed markets and more growth coming from our emerging markets.","In aggregate, we delivered top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while generating solid organic revenue growth and improved share performance. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.7%, driven by our pricing actions to recover higher commodity- and currency-driven input costs. As Brian will cover in detail shortly, we're deconsolidating our Venezuela operations, and this will have a material impact on our recent organic net revenue growth, as it does to our global category growth. Adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 38.9%, fueled by world-class net productivity. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 13.7% while continuing to build our advantaged platform through increased advertising and consumer support. And, finally, adjusted EPS increased 19% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong operating gains.","These results reflect the solid execution of our transformation agenda. First, we further focused our portfolio in our advantaged snacks categories. We combined our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world. And the proposed current transaction should further enhance our position in the global coffee category. We also strengthened our snacks portfolio by acquiring and integrating Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in the fast-growing free-from snacks in the U.S.","Second, we continue to aggressively reduce costs. We're now beginning to see the benefits of our supply chain reinvention as we upgrade our manufacturing network and install more efficient and more flexible Lines of the Future. For the year, we delivered net productivity of more than 3.5% of cost of goods sold, or nearly $700 million. That's world-class and another record year. We also reduced overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other tools, and we're beginning to institutionalize our approach to cost management.","These savings enabled us to expand margins and provide the necessary fuel to accelerate growth. During the year, we stepped up A&C investment behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. This enabled us to continue to strengthen brand equities and backstop some of our pricing actions. On the top line, as we made these investments, we've seen improvement in our volume trends, revenue growth, and market share performance as the year progressed. We actively monitored the payback of these investments, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our spending based on actual returns.","On the bottom line, by pricing to recover input cost inflation, we've protected profitability, allowing our net productivity gains to flow through to gross margin. In short, like many smart companies, we're selectively investing through the downturn in emerging markets, with continued investments in A&C and route to market so we can benefit disproportionately as these markets recover. Finally, we continue to strengthen our financial profile. We generated strong free cash flow, lowered our cost of debt, and returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders.","So, as you can see, we made good progress on many fronts this year. I'm indebted to our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment to delivering these results, especially in the face of such massive change.","With that as background, let's take a closer look at our 2015 top line results. For the full year, organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. This included a 90 basis point headwind related to our strategic actions to improve revenue mix. As expected, higher prices were the key driver, contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. While we fully expected significant pricing this year, the impact of the strengthening dollar on inflation in emerging markets, especially in the second half, forced us to price even more. While this helped protect margins, it also tempered our vol\/mix improvement. As Brian will discuss in a moment, our organic revenue growth \u2013 as I said, it adjusted for the deconsolidation of Venezuela \u2013 was 1.4%.","We're especially pleased that our Power Brands grew more than 5%, well above the rate of the overall company, as a result of targeted A&C support. As expected, developed markets, which comprised about 60% of our revenue, declined less than a percent, as we focused our efforts on cost reduction in this slower-growth environment. Emerging markets grew double digits, as we took a more balanced approach by reducing costs and stepping up investment in our brands and capabilities. This allowed us to protect our leading share positions in the near term while remaining ready to capitalize on their long-term potential.","Turning now to our results by region. While pricing was the main driver of our revenue growth, most of the pricing occurred in Latin America and EEMEA. Full the full year, Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by pricing in response to currency-driven inflation, especially in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America was up almost 7%. Brazil was up mid-single digits, as we priced to recover input cost inflation driven by the weakening real. Oreo continued its strong momentum behind increased A&C investment. However, growth in the second half slowed to low single digits as the macro-environment there deteriorated. Looking ahead, we do not expect conditions to improve in Brazil in the near term, and our forecast reflects this.","EEMEA was up 6%, driven primarily by pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of each country's currency. Russia grew high teens for the year, driven by strong growth across all categories, including our largest one, chocolate. Alpen Gold led the way in chocolate, while biscuit growth was fueled by the successful launch of Oreo. However, as in Brazil, volumes fell in the second half as categories slowed in response to weakening economic conditions and price elasticity.","Asia Pacific was up about 2%, with solid growth in China, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. For the full year, China was up high single digits, driven by strong vol\/mix in both biscuits and gum. belVita breakfast biscuits got off to a strong start, Oreo Thins continue to perform well behind distribution gains, while Stride gum was up high teens. However, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the overall economy. As a result, we remain cautious in our China forecast for 2016. India increased modestly, but we're pleased that chocolate grew solidly in the second half in response to stepped-up A&C investments. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up high single digits, and Bubbly is off to a strong start. In addition, Asia's growth was tempered by about a point from SKU reductions, as it was one of the regions most affected by the loss of some short-term Kraft licenses in late 2014.","Europe was down about 2%, including a drag of more than a point from strategic actions to improve revenue mix. Vol\/mix, while still negative, improved throughout the year, fueled by the benefits of increased A&C and narrowed price gaps. For example, Milka biscuits grew mid-single digits across the region, and U.K. biscuits grew mid-teens, fueled in part by our latest innovation, Ritz Crisp & Thin. North America was up about 1%, with biscuits growth accelerating in the second half behind increased A&C and innovation, including Oreo Thins and belVita Bites. Importantly, vol\/mix drove this acceleration.","Turning now to our categories. For the full year, our snacks categories were up about 5.5% and about the same if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. As with our revenue, pricing was the key driver, as volumes remained challenged. Our organic growth was about a point and a half below our categories. That was largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our strategic actions to improve revenue mix, as well as the price elasticity we experienced earlier in the year. Overall, more than 55% of our snacks revenue gained or held share, with solid performance across each category.","Let's take a closer look. The biscuits category was up about 7%, and our revenue was up about 6.5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. About 60% of our revenue gained or held share, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S., as well as solid share gains in Brazil. The chocolate category increased about 5.5%, while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflected the fact that we were the first to price in most of our markets. But as I said earlier, this was essential to protecting the health of our franchises. As expected, our performance improved in the second half, as price gaps narrowed and as we increased A&C support in key markets. As a result, market share steadily improved, with half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share for the full year. That's up from about 25% in the first half.","Lastly, the gum and candy category increased nearly 2%. Our revenue grew 4%, with both gum and candy up low to mid-single digits. Halls grew mid-single digits, driven by strong support behind the new Halls Air campaign that's now been rolled out across Europe, North America, and select markets in AP and EEMEA.","Finally, consistent with our plans, we increased A&C support behind high-return marketing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth and drive share. As you can see on slide 8, our organic growth accelerated sequentially as the year progressed, while our share performance was strongest in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we delivered this improvement while significantly expanding adjusted operating income margin, a true virtuous cycle.","In sum, we're pleased with our overall financial performance in 2015, as well as with the excellent progress we made in the transformation. As a result, we believe we're well-positioned to deliver strong results again in 2016.","Let me now turn it over to Brian, who'll provide details on our 2015 margin performance and earnings growth, as well as on our 2016 outlook.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Irene, and good morning.","Starting with slide 9, you can see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%. As Irene mentioned earlier, strong net productivity was the key driver for this improvement. We're now beginning to see the early benefits from our upgraded supply chain network, including the installation of our highly efficient Lines of the Future. For the year, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point benefit. We also delivered another year of strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 170 basis points to 13.7%, while increasing our growth investments significantly. We continued to drive down overhead costs as a percentage of revenue, leveraging ZBB to identify areas of opportunity and capture the savings. These approaches are now the way we work and will continue to deliver benefits for us as we move forward.","For the year, A&C spending was nearly 9% of revenue, up about 60 basis points. Most of the step-up was in the second half, including a significant increase in the fourth quarter. As Irene discussed earlier, these investments helped us accelerate organic revenue growth and improved our share performance as the year progressed. We're continuing to prioritize our spending to generate the best overall returns.","Now let's look at margin by region. As you can see on slide 9, developed markets drove most of the margin expansion, with North America up 230 basis points and Europe up 190. In both regions, strong net productivity drove significant gross margin expansion, and overheads were down as well. In Latin America, OI margin decreased 70 basis points, largely as a result of cycling the benefit from value-added tax-related settlements in the prior year, while the weakening macro-environment also pressured vol\/mix. But in EEMEA and AP, OI margin increased 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. In both regions, gross margin expansion and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C.","Turning to EPS, adjusted EPS was $1.75 for the year, up 19% on a constant-currency basis. Strong operating gains of $0.22 drove the increase, and the year-over-year change in mark-to-market added $0.06. Below the operating income line, lower interest expense and the benefit from a lower share count more than offset the headwind from higher taxes and dilution from the coffee transaction that closed in July. Including an unfavorable currency translation impact of $0.33, adjusted EPS was flat.","As you can see on slide 13, over the past three years we've returned more than $11 billion of capital to our shareholders, including nearly $3 billion in dividends and more than $8 billion in share repurchases. For 2015, we accelerated this activity by returning $4.6 billion. This included $1 billion in dividends, as well as buying back $3.6 billion of stock, or roughly 92 million shares at an average price of $39.43 per share. As we exited the year, we had about $5.5 billion remaining under the current buyback authorization that goes through 2018.","Before turning to our 2016 outlook, let me update you on the change we're making in our accounting treatment for Venezuela. As you saw in our press release today, effective at the end of the fourth quarter, we deconsolidated our Venezuela operations and we began to account for our investments in Venezuela using the cost method of accounting in our GAAP financial statements. As a result, we took a one-time accounting charge of $778 million to our fourth quarter 2015 reported results to remove all assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan operations from our balance sheet.","On slide 14, we've summarized the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela on our 2015 results. Excluding Venezuela, organic revenue was up 1.4% versus 3.7% including Venezuela. You should also note that removing Venezuela reduces 2015 total category growth to approximately 4%. Our adjusted OI margin excluding Venezuela was 50 basis points lower, as our margins there were higher than our total company average. But the impact on our margin improvement was relatively minor. Excluding Venezuela, we expanded margin 150 basis points versus the 170 basis point increase including Venezuela. Finally, excluding Venezuela reduced our adjusted EPS by $0.10. As we move to our 2016 outlook, please note all of our guidance reflects a 2015 baseline that excludes Venezuela.","With that, let's move to our outlook. You'll see that our approach to 2016 is consistent with our 2015 playbook. We continue to target underlying organic revenue growth in line with our categories. This means prudently increasing investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to accelerate revenue growth and gain share while remaining nimble in how and when we deploy A&C resources across key markets to deliver attractive returns. It also means maintaining our commitment to invest in sales and route-to-market capabilities, so that we're well positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth potential in emerging markets.","We also believe we have further opportunities to improve revenue mix by optimizing trade spending and eliminating less profitable SKUs. While we expect this will be a headwind to our reported organic growth, it strengthens the underlying health of our business and is a contributor to our margin improvement. The challenge will be in striking the right balance between competitive position and customer response so that we aren't simply losing revenue and that the impact is net positive on the P&L and the cash flow.","Our supply chain reinvention initiatives remain on track, and we'll increasingly benefit from the upgraded infrastructure and capabilities that we're putting in place around the world. We'll continue to reduce overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting. Incrementally in 2016, we'll begin to realize savings from implementing global shared services, as we eliminate redundant resources and complete process migration work. Finally, we'll continue to look to price to recover currency driven input cost inflation, so that the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives can flow to the bottom line.","In sum, we remain focused on reducing costs, expanding margins, and building our advantaged platform to drive top line growth. Our overall approach to our 2016 outlook aligns well with the long-term advantages of our snacking categories. But it's no secret that 2016 is expected to be another challenging year. On slide 16, you can see various issues that are affecting all categories, not just ours. Considering this macroeconomic outlook and the weakening trends we saw during Q4 in several of these markets, we're estimating that global snack category growth market will slow to 3% to 4% this year. That's down from the price-driven growth of about 4% in 2015, excluding Venezuela. While headwinds may affect the near term, we continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects for snacking.","Given this backdrop of challenging category dynamics, we expect our 2016 organic revenue growth to be at least 2%. We view this as a prudent top line outlook, given the volatility and recent trends that we're seeing. This includes a 125 basis point headwind from our actions to improve revenue mix by selectively optimizing trade spending and continuing to eliminate less profitable SKUs. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our underlying organic revenue growth to be in line with our forecast of 3% to 4% global category growth.","Now let's look at our margin outlook. For 2016, we expect to deliver on our previously committed adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%. As we said earlier, the deconsolidation of our higher margin business in Venezuela creates an approximately 50 basis point headwind, so we're now likely to be at the lower end of that range. However, our year-over-year margin expansion is expected to be in the range of 200 basis points versus 2015. Said another way, we would have expected to be at the high end of the committed range of 15% to 16% had we not deconsolidated Venezuela.","Overall, we expect the drivers of our margin expansion to be similar to last year. Specifically, we expect strong contribution from our supply chain as we continue to drive world-class net productivity levels. We now have approximately 35 state-of-the-art Lines of the Future currently on stream, and we're clearly seeing benefits hitting the P&L as we ramp up production levels. We also expect to continue to reduce overheads as we execute our ZBB program, as we adjust our organization model, and we realize the first savings from migrating back-office processes to global shared services.","In 2015, as we began to transition key processes, in many cases we maintained duplicate resourcing until we were confident that the migration was successful. As we ramp up shared services and eliminate these redundant transition costs, we expect savings to build, not only during 2016, but through 2018. We also expect to expand margins by improving our revenue mix. As we execute on this plan, we expect our margins to build as the year progresses.","Given the progress we've made, and the clarity of our plans and actions beyond 2016, we're confident in our ability to deliver an adjusted OI margin of 17% to 18% in 2018. On a pro forma basis, excluding Venezuela across all years, the midpoint of this 2018 target equates to an over 400 basis point increase versus 2015, and an almost 700 basis point improvement versus our 2013 baseline.","We expect to deliver this margin target by continuing to focus on three things. First, productivity gains from our supply chain. These are funded and in our plan, and we're now expanding and replicating a model that's working. Second, more overhead reductions from lower indirect costs, savings from our global share services, and organizational efficiency. And, third, improved revenue mix. These improvements will be partially offset by increased A&C support as we further align our share of voice with our share of market.","Turning to our 2016 EPS outlook, by delivering our organic revenue and margin targets, we expect adjusted EPS to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant-currency basis. We expect this increase to be driven primarily by operating gains. Below the line, while we expect a lower share count to provide a modest benefit, this will likely be offset by the impact of the coffee divestiture, as we had two quarters of fully owned coffee business in full year 2015.","So before we take your questions, I'd like to go over a few other items for financial modeling purposes. First, based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate a currency headwind of approximately 6 percentage points for revenue and approximately $0.13 for EPS. We expect adjusted interest expense to be between $650 million and $675 million, or about the same as 2015. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be in the low to mid 20s for 2016, roughly similar to our 2015 rate. And we expect to repurchase about $2 billion of our shares as we deliver on our commitment to spend the remaining coffee transaction proceeds on share buybacks this year.","In addition, with respect to JDE, at the back of the presentation is an updated framework to help you estimate its earnings. As you know, JDE is a private company, so we won't share significant detail on their results or projections. JDE management expects performance to be pressured this year, as a result of their strategic actions to better position the company for long-term success. As an investor in JDE, we remain very confident in the long-term potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for its shareholders. In addition, with our participation in the proposed Keurig transaction, we'll be well positioned in the on-demand segment in North America, while further enhancing our global footprint. We'll update you on its impact to our financials after the closing.","So to wrap up, we delivered very strong results in 2015. In 2016, we expect macro conditions, especially in emerging markets, to remain difficult and potentially worsen, which will weigh on category and revenue growth. As you might expect, and I think you're hearing from others, we're seeing even more volatility in markets like Brazil, China, and Russia, even as we start our first quarter. As a result, we'll continue focusing on driving strong margin expansion and earnings growth; we'll improve our top line growth, revenue mix, and share performance; and we'll return significant capital to shareholders. We'll talk more about our strong cash flow generation at the upcoming CAGNY conference.","We remain very confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda and deliver an adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With our advantaged assets, leadership, and capabilities, we believe we're one of the few industry players with the potential to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two questions for me, if I could. First, if we exclude Venezuela and strategic actions from both 2015 and 2016, looks like you expect organic net revenue growth to accelerate from, call it 2.2% to a little over 3%, even though, I guess, certain key markets have become a little more difficult heading into 2016, and you have said that you're expecting category growth rates to slow. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense of what the key reasons are to expect this organic growth acceleration? Is it the A&C spend? Is it the share progress? Or what's driving that thought process? And then I've got a follow-up.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Andrew, I understand the question. There's a lot going on here. But I think it reflects the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. There's no question that our revenue will improve from probably more like about a 2%, 3% underlying to, as you say, about \u2013 a little over 3% this year. That's fueled by strong A&C support, by continued progress in terms of vol\/mix, while still improving our margins significantly from about 150 points in 2015 to 200 in 2016, en route to about, as we said, 17% to 18% in 2018, which reflects about a 700 basis point improvement over the five-year period. All of that while still generating double-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow. So we think our underlying business fundamentals are quite solid. There's obviously a lot of moving pieces in this challenging environment. But we're doing what we said we're going to do. We think our underlying business is sound, and we think we're well-positioned to continue to deliver strong growth in a challenging environment.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Andrew, it builds on the success. And you can see the trend as we play through the year of -","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","\u2013 improving vol\/mix, revenue picking up, and clearly share performance improving exiting the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it; thanks for that. And then, second, with respect to the 2018 margin target, is this just capturing previously announced plans that you've talked about beyond 2016, or are there incremental actions, I guess, beyond the $1.5 billion target that you've talked about? And, I guess, importantly, what sort of volume picture or outlook is that margin target predicated on?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, it really is just better line of sight to the actions that we're working now to deliver on this target. Good momentum and cost reduction programs as we execute on those plans, supply chain. As you know, those actions continue even beyond 2016 and 2017, and that will continue to generate benefits. So it's really not anything new or incremental. It's the same playbook. And as we've gotten farther into it, we have much more confidence. So \u2013 and in terms of the overall environment, we're not counting on a return of emerging markets to historical growth rates here. I think we're building on what we see today in the world, and that's the basis for this target.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it; thank you. See you in a couple weeks.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Chris.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Just had two questions as well if I could. The first would be maybe for Brian. As we look at 2016, and we're starting to see some of this in the fourth quarter, this benefit to the gross margin coming through from Lines of the Future and supply chain benefits. Should the gross margin be kind of the main driver of the operating margin expansion for the year? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how that may play into it, and how input cost inflation will fare in 2016 as well.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, look, I think it'll continue to be both. As we've said, supply chain ramped throughout the year, and we saw the Lines of the Future really generating more benefits in the second half. We said that all year, and that's really how it played out. That will continue and, as you know, I mean, we've now got success in implementing these Lines of the Future in each of the categories, and it's really about taking that model and implementing it in a broader set of assets around the world. So it's something we're very confident in.","On indirect costs and shared services, obviously ZBB and attacking some of the key cost packages was probably the lowest hanging fruit and some of the earliest benefits. But things like shared services and some of the organizational efficiency work is really a 2016 driver. So, I guess it's going to continue to be both. As you saw the results in 2015, clearly, it was a strong gross margin driven year. But we also made significant investments in A&C. And that's another dynamic that's going to play out, and that affected SG&A. So it's a little bit of both.","And commodity inflation \u2013 look, I think clearly there's some pockets of improved commodity dynamics playing out over the last couple months. But you have to keep in mind that currencies are also a big part of that, and in most cases they're going the other way, especially in some of the key markets for us. So, right now it's not a big driver for us, given that we have to look at both of those together.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And just really kind of related to that, a follow-on to that, if you look at the revenue growth, kind of using the 2% or at least 2% rate of growth, is that \u2013 that's primarily pricing driven? And I know there's a comment about it being pricing driven in the emerging markets. And do you expect volume growth for 2016?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It'll get better, Chris, but, no, it's still going to be challenged because of the strong impact of pricing.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But certainly the overall \u2013 we don't anticipate the overall impact of pricing to be as extreme as it was this past year.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I'll stick with the two-question pattern if I can. First, when you initially provided guidance years ago for an EBIT margin in 2016 of 15% to 16%, you provided a road map, if you would, as part of a presentation, to get there. I think something similar to what you have on maybe slide 12 today. Is this something you might be willing to do again at some point regarding 2018's margin? I'm just trying to get a better idea of specifically which line items grow when, sense of timing, and so forth.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Ken, we'll talk a bit more about it at CAGNY. I would say it's going to look a lot like the road map you have. And I think the things that we're executing today have resulted in the progress we've made thus far, and they're the same things that are going drive us through 2018. It's, as I said earlier, it's not really a new set of initiatives that are going to get us there. We have increasing confidence, and we're going to execute the things that are in front of us. So we'll show you more of that at CAGNY, but I'm not sure it'll be exciting and new, other than maybe some of the revenue mix activity that we're focused on that we both talked about today.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, you'd be surprised by what we find exciting at CAGNY.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","We'll do our best.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then one quick one from me on Europe. If I recall, one of the reasons why 3Q was a little bit weak was because of hot weather, which I think hurt you and some of your peers as well. Maybe it was just my model, but was Europe a little bit more sluggish versus what you expected this quarter? We had thought that maybe volumes would repeat a little bit just given that the weather had normalized a little?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we actually are pleased with the progression that we've seen in Europe, Ken. We did invest \u2013 as we got out of the hot weather \u2013 we did invest particularly behind chocolate as the year ended. And as a result of that, our revenue is still down, but the underlying growth was modestly higher. If you recall, Europe is the region that experienced the greatest impact of our strategic actions. It hit us for about 135 bips, and so -","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In the quarter.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","\u2013 in Q4. So, the aggregate revenue in the fourth quarter for Europe was down about 1.1%; it was almost entirely fueled by these strategic actions. We're very pleased to see our share trends improving, particularly in chocolate, which was the hardest hit because of pricing actions, especially in the U.K. and Germany, as well as we saw improvement in biscuits in France. At the same time, we were driving significant margin expansion, up over 200 bps for the year. So, we're very pleased with the exiting position of Europe. I think they are well positioned from a margin and a profitability perspective now to grow off of that base.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Spillane of Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Brian.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've got two questions, both related to organic sales growth. And the first one is just in terms of the guidance for 2016, just want to clarify, the 2% growth includes 125 basis point drag from the vol\/mix impact from trade optimization and the SKU reduction. I guess, would the trade optimization \u2013 why isn't there a positive? I guess I kind of read that as being that there'd be less trade spending, and so there should be revenue lift from that. So, can you just clarify why it would be like a net negative when there should be, I would have sensed, maybe some net price realization in there? Is it because the SKU reduction is so much bigger, or am I just misunderstanding?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, you're right. It's partly because there's a volume impact as we take these actions. In the case of the pruning, it's about shelf space. In the case of trade optimization, it's about competitive position and customer reaction. And that's why we are so methodical in how we approach this opportunity. So you will ultimately see a net positive as these things play through. You certainly will start to see the benefits in our overall revenue mix, in our profitability, and it's a real enabler to the simplification in our supply chain activity. So you will see the benefits play through, but there is a short-term impact as we take some of these actions.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So it sort of rebases the volume this year, and then there should be a lift off of that in 2017? Is that kind of the way to think about that?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, except that we're taking some additional actions, so essentially it pulls the 90 bips out, and then we're taking out another approximately 125 basis points. The net of that, though, is that we have a healthier franchise, and we think we're well positioned to grow off of that base.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just \u2013 more the \u2013 between now and 2018, as you think about \u2013 as we think about the increased A&C spend that you're planning, how much of it now is going to seeding sort of white space opportunities, or how much of it is just spending more behind your existing products to support the price increases or to stay in front of consumers in a weak environment? Just trying to understand, at what point do we start to see some lift from taking advantage of the white space opportunities? Is that pushed out a little bit because of the environment?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's disproportionately the impact on the base franchise. And, in fact, that's one of the reasons that you saw the sequential improvement as we exited 2015, and we will expect to see continued improvement in 2016. As we've said before, we use investments in white space, we make investments in white spaces somewhat sparingly. We need to establish the franchise, we need to establish a supply chain, often get our manufacturing up and running. And we do have a road map that will get all of our categories to all of our markets over time. But as you think about the investment that we made, for example, in gum in China, that's been a sizable investment. It's paying off quite nicely, but we only do a few of those every year or so. They take a little bit longer to pay back, and particularly in this challenging environment we're being a lot more prudent in terms of those kinds of investments. All that said, as I mentioned in my remarks, smart companies are making the investments in the downturn to be well positioned. And so much of our investment is behind our existing franchises there, and selectively we're looking at white space opportunities.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you. We'll see you down in Florida in a few weeks.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, folks.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for the question. I want to come back to Spillane's line of questioning. First, congratulations on the market share progression throughout the year. I'm quite intrigued by the trade budget optimization stuff. We're definitely big fans of the opportunity in the industry. We've been somewhat cautious in terms of sizing the prize within the broader snacking space, given the expandable consumption nature of the categories, the impulsive nature. And, as Spillane pointed out, your guidance for this to be a net sales drag implies elasticity on that trade spend reduction greater than one. So can you walk us through a little more detail in terms of scale and scope of how you're attacking this and how you're planning to mitigate the risk of market share losses as competitors step in to fill the void?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, Jason, the impact of 2016 is going to be much more related to the SKU reduction than trade optimization. As you know, we appointed Mark Clouse to the position of Chief Commercial Officer. He began in that role early this year, and one of his main deliverables is helping us with trade spending optimization. We're just getting started with that work. And, as I mentioned, it's critical that we strike the right balance between our competitive position and our customer response, making sure that it's a net positive impact. So in the near term, particularly in 2016, the bulk of our strategic actions will continue to be focused on eliminating tail brands and less profitable SKUs across each region, which will have a clear impact in the near term, but as I said before, stage us exceptionally well for the long term.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then one more quick question and I'll pass it on. Latin America, I know there's some comparison issues on the prior year, but even if we stripped those comparison issues out, it was a particularly soft quarter in terms of the margin profile for the business. Anything unique there? Is there something to extrapolate on the forward, or could you talk us through the details there?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, look, in the quarter, a lot of the tax benefit that we had in the prior year was in the fourth quarter, the biggest piece of it. So that's probably the biggest dynamic. I would just say, look, we saw, as we said in the comments, a weakening macro in places like Brazil that challenged us a bit. But the biggest one by far, Jason, is the year-over-year tax impact.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Hey, Matthew.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. I just had a few follow-ups on the increased A&C spending. First, I guess just from a mathematical standpoint, can you clarify where we are on a pro forma basis in terms of A&C as a percent of sales and whether the deconsolidation means we're now a bit closer to the long-term target and we'll be more focused on optimizing the effectiveness of the spend? And then, anecdotally, now that you've been through a few quarters of beginning to ramp up the level of spending, can you talk at all about where you found the reinvestment to be particularly effective, where you've made the decision to pull back based on the payback you've observed?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would say not a whole \u2013 there's not a lot of A&C that was spent in Venezuela. So you can sort of do the math. It does bring the number up a little bit. As we said, we're sort of exiting the year at a 9% sort of run rate. And much of that was ramping as we headed through the year. So it's one of the drivers of the profitability in Venezuela, was the fact that we didn't really have much A&C and we didn't need it in that market. So that's sort of the first part of your question. I'll let Irene take the second.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're seeing our spending is up to about 9% of revenue. It's up about 60 bips. And as we look at where we spent it, we're very pleased with the returns that we're getting. So we invested behind biscuits in the U.S., things like Oreo Thins and belVita Bites. We are seeing significant investment year over year in the fourth quarter as we exit the year almost to 3% revenue growth on our biscuit business. I mentioned the impact on EU chocolate, where we invested behind our franchise, in the chocolate franchise, in particular in the U.K. We see continued improvement in Germany despite the fact that that was one of the areas that we chose to take out some of our less profitable volume.","In addition, there's a number of markets where we backstopped our pricing actions as we priced in response to currency devaluation, markets like Brazil and Russia. And, again, if you look at our share performance and you look at our margin performance, you see the impact of those investments. So we're going to continue to monitor our performance quite closely, but we want to be sure that we remain nimble in our ability to capture opportunities as we see them and continuing to make the necessary infrastructure investments as well as the markets recover.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, and see you in Florida.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Athlos Research.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Good morning. Thanks very much. Just wanted to ask a big-picture question, Irene. If you \u2013 I wonder what makes Mondelez special is this global growth opportunity. And I think as you talk about organic net revenue growth, what people are really sort of thinking is the volume growth opportunity that comes from growing units in all these fast-growing emerging markets. If I look at your four-year growth projection on a volume basis, you're down in what are supposed to be the volume-driving segments of your business, other than Eastern Europe. You're down in Latin America, you're down in Asia Pacific. And while currency's a part of that, macro's a part of it, maybe not your fault, a couple of concerns I have that I'd love your thoughts on.","First, when you see \u2013 first, whenever you trade off pricing and volume, that's a lot easier on the margin structure than having to go the other way, and you do eventually need to go the other way on volume growth to sustain any margin expansions. And, secondly, do you worry in some of these markets where you look at an Asia Pacific or Latin America where you're working hard, doing the right thing to maintain that margin structure that's fair to investors, but you're seeing some unit declines. Do you worry that it kind of reverses that networking effect and you get less usage and less households using the products over time in a way that maybe constrains the five- and 10-year growth of the company? So how are you thinking about that balance? Thanks very much.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thanks. Thank you for that question, Jon. We obviously continue to pay very close attention to the impact of our pricing actions on our volumes. I would remind you that our 2015 vol\/mix was down about 3 points. That's about 1 point from Venezuela, about 1 point from the strategic actions we took, and about 1 point of elasticity, which was mostly in the first half. As we started to make the investments, as we locked in our margins and started to make the investments in selected markets in the back half, we saw a very strong improvement in the \u2013 not only in the vol\/mix trend, but also in our individual franchise performance.","As we look to 2016, our intent again is to make sure that we're continuing to get a positive benefit. We're not going to give you specific guidance for the split between pricing and vol\/mix, but as I mentioned, we are expecting pricing to be less of an impact. But it will continue to be pressured as we see inflation in these emerging markets. I think most importantly, what you need to look to for us is to make sure that we're continuing to make the investments necessary to stage our business for the long term as these emerging markets recover. And so it's a constant monitoring of how we're performing, but we think we're getting the right balance here. But it does have \u2013 it has had a short-term impact, but we're quite encouraged by the results we're seeing in the back half of the year, and we've reflected that in our guidance for 2016.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, Jonathan, we want to be patient. I mean, we believe there is a long-term volume growth dynamic clearly in these emerging markets, and we're making the investments, as Irene said, to ensure that we're positioned for that. But the reality is in the short term, given what's happened with currency and commodities over the last several quarters, it's really driven the dynamic, and it's forced all the pricing through. That's really the driver here.","Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Eric.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Eric.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I guess just a couple of questions. First one on the slide on page 8 that talks about the snack share performance, that's like a running like on a year to date. And wouldn't that imply that the fourth quarter share, given the jump from the third to the fourth quarter, does that imply like the third quarter share improvement was like 65% or 70%?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm trying to follow your math here, Eric. There's no question that our share improvement spiked in the fourth quarter. Much of the investment that we made would have hit in the market in the fourth quarter, and you see that play through on the slide.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, slide 8. Yeah, I mean, as you recall, Eric, I mean, these were in the 45% range last time we looked at it, last time we shared it.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So big jump in the fourth quarter. And we tend to look at it on a year-to-date basis.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Okay, okay. And then CapEx has been running like $1.6 billion. Obviously with currency and Venezuela, your dollars, your net income is going be pressured, but given the weaker volume that we've been discussing, can lower CapEx offset that, so maybe free cash flow is not as impaired by some of these developments?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'll take you through more detail on cash flow. We had a, I would say, significantly stronger cash flow in 2015 than what we had targeted and shared with you, and we'll update you on that as we talk at CAGNY. I think \u2013 look, we'll continue to monitor the environment. I mean, this volume dynamic is something that's affecting how we're spending CapEx. And we've been, I would say, prudent and thoughtful around where we're spending CapEx. And, at the same time, I also want to say we're sticking to the plan, and the reality is that we still have investments to make as part of executing and building the supply chain capabilities to deliver on the 2018 targets we just talked about. So, as we've said, I think 2015 was the peak in CapEx. It'll get reset a little bit as the revenue comes down with Venezuela, but I think you'll see it come down from here, and as we get toward 2017-2018, be it at the levels we've talked about, closer to the 4% to 4.5% sort of range.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then if I could just \u2013 last one, bigger-picture question for Irene. I realize that Hershey \u2013 your businesses are quite different. But Hershey's talked about, at least in the U.S., kind of a much more competitive landscape for snacks and confection, different consumer habits maybe affecting overall how the market works, promotion, et cetera. Is part of the SKU cuts across the globe, is part of that a function of \u2013 and I assume these are some of the local brands that you got via Cadbury \u2013 but is it because the consumers' habits are changing and, like meat snacks or something else are more relevant? Or is it something else that's playing out? Thanks.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we actually feel quite optimistic about the outlook for our snacks in North America. We're seeing good progress, as we said, as we exited the year. The growth rate is in excess of the category growth rates. In fact, we're driving it. We feel very good about our DSD support. We think we're getting good in-store presence; our shares are strong. And we've got a good innovation pipeline. So I think we're well-staged to continue to drive growth in this geography.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think the bigger-picture point on SKUs, SKU reduction, is really about allowing us to focus on the Power Brands and really put more resources against them.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But, as you said, it was disproportionately in the emerging markets because of some of the acquisitions. So, I mean, our portfolio in North America is a lot more focused on the Power Brands than what we're seeing elsewhere in the world.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yep.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. Pass it on.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, Eric.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. I was watching the stock price, and it's down today. And I don't think it's because of Venezuela because I think that's just an accounting change. But I think people are definitely dialing in on the volume and the guidance, the caution about guidance for top line for next year. And I just want to make sure I got my numbers straight. You're saying that the category growth will probably be 3% to 4%. And if you strip out kind of the SKU rat, and you would be, I guess, 3% plus. So right in that 3% to 4%. Did you consider, though, kind of saying that you would be above the 3% to 4% on a normalized basis? Because I think you are making progress in gaining share. Fourth quarter definitely demonstrates that. And I guess the follow-up is can you commit to 55% of your categories gaining share in 2016, just to kind of hammer home the point?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the simple point, Rob, is don't forget that we are growing essentially in line with our categories in 2016, while we're expanding margins by about 200 basis points. And I think it's our ability to drive top and bottom line as one of the things that will continue to distinguish us, and so I think we've got good visibility to the places and the programming and the investment levels that we need to continue to protect our shares and ultimately drive our shares. But, as you rightly point out, in that timeframe, I think we're going to continue to see the balance that we've laid out. Longer term, we would expect clearly to deliver revenue growth at or above the rate of our categories.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, I think, Rob, if we saw more momentum in the markets, and things were a little less volatile, I think we'd have more confidence in being a little more forward-leaning with that, but that's part of what we're thinking here.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So it's prudent guidance in light of the fact that there's a big margin expansion target going on at the same time?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As well as a challenging macro environment.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, yeah.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, as we told you, we're seeing \u2013 even as we look at this first quarter \u2013 we're seeing continued pressure in a number of the emerging markets.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Bernstein.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Alexia.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. So two quick ones. On the SKU rationalization, that's been going on for a couple of years now. Can you sort of \u2013 is there an end in sight in terms of when that's going to be impacting your sales? Will it be particularly heavy in the first half of the year; will it ease off in the back half? That's the first question.","And then the second one is, excluding the advertising spending as a percent of sales, it looks as though SG&A was fairly flat. Can you quantify the impact of the Latin American VAT hit, and if there were any other things in there that are causing your SG&A not to come down? I know that you've done a lot of cost-cutting, big head count reduction, and moved to a global shared services organization in September. It just surprises me that the SG&A didn't move this quarter. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the SKU rationalization activities, look, I think this is \u2013 we're making progress. And I guess what I'll commit is we'll give you a bit of an update in CAGNY on that as well. But it is a key lever as we think about the supply chain. And simplifying our product offerings as part of that activity allows us to get at costs and simplify what we're doing in the plants. And there's lots of examples that we can take you through. I would say we're in the middle of that. I don't know that it's going to be a front-half\/back-half kind of discussion. We're going to continue to work through it and as we do it, we'll adjust the targets and the plans there. But we're making good progress. I'll just tell you that, I think.","On SG&A, really three dynamics, I think, that are probably inconsistent with how people are thinking about it. One is, obviously, I'm not sure everybody fully got the A&C step-up that we're doing here. And that's obviously showing up in the SG&A. We have, obviously, incentive comp that flows through there, and given the strong performance versus targets, that's up year over year. And then currency. I mean, I think those are the three big drivers that would represent \u2013 and I'd probably tell you a third, a third, a third \u2013 in terms of where it is in SG&A. So the underlying performance in overheads, the work that we're doing on indirects, and the broader organizational activities is generating benefits. We exceeded our internal targets on ZBB benefits this year, and we've actually taken up what we're going to do there for 2016 as part of the plan.","Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Alexia.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey. Good morning. I'll keep it real quick in terms of time. My first question is, given the challenges in South America, is there an opportunity to accelerate or reassess any sort of opportunities for cost savings or do anything different given that you have a different environment there?","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Look, I think we're pretty pleased with the businesses we have in Latin America. I think it does \u2013 I mean, there's some slight dynamics around our headquarters overhead in Latin America as a result of now deconsolidating Venezuela. I think it's more a country-by-country look at the dynamics of what's playing out in the Brazil market, or Argentina, or other places given inflation and what we're seeing in volatility. But, again, the fundamental dynamics in those markets, I mean, we like the gross margins, we like our competitive position. They are part of what we're doing on supply chain and ZBB and all the other activities. We'll continue to look at that and adjust targets as appropriate. But I'm not sure anything changes in terms of the big-picture plan for South America.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean, I would say we are constantly benchmarking each of our countries across our landscape, and as well as versus competitors to the best of our abilities. And so I think we've got a pretty good handle on where the opportunities are. And that's essentially been the plan that we've been executing.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. And a point of clarification, just making sure I understand it, your 18% margin does not require you guys to do anything besides hit your volumes in line with the category growth? There's no expectations in there that you should exceed? It's not dependent on any sort of volume numbers that are above the category? Is that \u2013 my understanding of that, is that fair?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on some of the earlier questioning. What are some examples of how the economic weakness is causing you to revisit your marketing plans, if at all, whether it be value packaging or perhaps slowing the pace of new products or the pursuits of these white-space opportunities you mentioned?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think without a doubt it is certainly impacting how we execute our pricing. Depending upon the market, we're using a combination of tactics, whether it's list price increases, trade spending, reduction, price pack architecture both on the low end and the high end. And, quite frankly, that's allowed us, as we've had \u2013 as we've talked before, one of the benefits of our Lines of the Future is it gives us much greater flexibility with respect to packaging, which then allows us to execute pricing in a much less disruptive way to the marketplace. I think it's one of the reasons that you see our vol\/mix improving as the year progressed and as we exited the year. So we certainly are doing our best to make sure that every price, it has as small an impact on the overall consumer landscape.","I'd also say that virtually all of the pricing actions we have taken have been in response to comment to industry cost. And so some of the elasticity impact has simply been the time it takes for some of our competitors to execute pricing actions. And as we've seen those price gaps narrow in markets like Russia and Brazil, for example, or some of the actions we have taken in markets like the U.K. or Germany, we are seeing our shares improve. So we're doing our best to manage the landscape, and it varies market to market. But certainly as we think about some of our infrastructure investments, I'll give you the \u2013 we have a factory going up in Russia, for example. We've moved a lot more slowly in this current environment as we think about that investment as a result of what we're seeing in the macro environment.","Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, David, given the volatility, I mean, we're actively watching these A&C investments and the specific activities and tracking returns. And having the data and the tools and the willingness to adjust them and move money where it's paying off and where we see the long-term benefits is something that I think we're getting better, at and we've got some better processes in place to do that proactively as the volatility is playing out.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","That was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Dexter Congbalay - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning.

Shortly after market closed today, we sent out our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors.","During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","Before we get started, I have one comment regarding the timing of our calls. Based on investor feedback from recent surveys, we plan to hold our earnings calls after market close going forward. We heard from many investors who would prefer not to have the call during market trading. This new timing allows additional time to digest results and provide commentary prior to the next day's market open.","And, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Shep, and good afternoon. As you read news from around the world these days, it's clear that an unprecedented number of economies are facing significant disruption and uncertainty. Slower GDP growth, currency and commodity volatility, the uncertain impact of the Brexit vote, market shocks like the recent demonetization in India, and complex developments in the political landscape, including a backlash against globalization. The impacts from these events are being felt across many companies and industries, and we're not immune. We're dealing with these realities with a sense of urgency: to control what we can and create contingencies for what we can't.","Before diving into our results, I'd like to take a step back to underscore our approach for long-term value creation in today's uncertain world. Our strategy is guided by the belief that the best companies have been and will continue to be those with the brands, platforms, and capabilities to create long-term value for shareholders, by delivering sustainable growth on both the bottom and the top lines.","We continued to improve operational efficiencies throughout our business, expanding margins and focusing on delivering consistent returns to shareholders by growing our bottom line. In fact, over the past four years, we've delivered double-digit compound growth in adjusted EPS at constant currency. Few of our competitors have done that. But we also recognize that great companies simply cannot cut their way to long-term growth, and so we haven't lost sight of the need to invest in our business, to support sustainable top line growth.","While we're encouraged by our results in 2016, we acknowledge that our top line is not yet where we want it to be. Some of this is due to factors outside of our control, some is due to mixed execution on our part, and some reflects deliberate actions we've taken to run a more profitable business.","So with that as context, let me discuss our 2016 performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.47, up 12%; adjusted OI margin expansion of 110 basis points; organic revenue growth of only 0.6%, reflecting the significant impact from India demonetization and selected market contractions. Our Power Brands grew nearly 2%, which outpaced category growth, and we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders.","For the full year, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 24%, at constant currency; strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 230 basis points, fueled by significant net productivity and overhead savings; organic growth of 1.3%, including the impact of approximately 110 basis points from revenue management and India demonetization. Once again, our Power Brands grew above category rates, up nearly 3%, and we returned $3.7 billion to our shareholders.","We achieved these results despite the current market realities. For example, in the UK and India, two markets with good momentum through the first half, extraordinary events like Brexit and demonetization muted the impact of our investments. And in Brazil and U.S. biscuits, two highly competitive markets, our trade spending in the quarter did not deliver the volumes we expected. In Brazil, macroeconomic headwinds depressed demand for biscuits and led to significant down-trading by consumers. And in the U.S., aggressive spending by a key competitor failed to provide any uplift in growth, and simply compressed margins.","From time to time in the short term, we will choose to defend our share in response to specific competitive actions. Over the long term, however, we're far more focused on growing our share and our categories through brand equity, innovation, and price pack architecture. And that's where we're making most of our investments. So despite some puts and takes on the top line, we continue to grow. And on the bottom line, we're significantly expanding margins and delivering sizable returns to our shareholders.","As we've outlined before, our strategy is built on three pillars: investing for growth, reducing costs, and focusing our portfolio. We'll have more time to update you on our progress at CAGNY, but let me quickly give you some 2016 highlights.","Disciplined investing for growth remains critical to our strategy. As Tim Coffer, our Chief Growth Officer, outlined last September, our growth plan is focused in three areas. First, contemporizing our core business to ensure that our portfolio remains relevant to today's consumers. This includes increasing resources and investment behind our Power Brands, our largest and most profitable trademarks, which represent nearly 70% of our revenues. This focus is paying off. In 2016, our Power Brands continued to outpace category growth, led by Oreo, Milka, and belVita.","Second, we're adding to the core by filling in key white spaces, by bringing our Power Brands to growing markets and usage occasions where we're underrepresented today. We're seeing early success from our launches of Milka chocolate in China, and the repatriation of our Nabisco biscuit trademarks in Japan, and we just entered the U.S. chocolate market with Milka Oreo and GREEN & BLACK'S.","We're also addressing consumer white spaces, the most significant of which is the shift toward well-being. GOOD THiNS and belVita Soft Bakeds are two examples from our strong innovation pipeline, and GMO-free triscuit is one of our most recent examples of brand renovation.","Third, we're expanding sales and distribution capabilities to ensure that our products are available wherever and whenever people shop. In the online arena, which is a small but growing channel for snacks, as consumers increasingly choose to shop online, we're building an industry-leading eCommerce snacks business, targeting at least $1 billion in revenue by 2020.","Despite our overall reduction in overheads, we've invested to build a dedicated eCommerce team and to enhance our supply chain capabilities in this space. These efforts are already paying off as our eCommerce business grew more than 35% on a reported basis in 2016.","While we continue to invest to drive the top line, given today's market realities, we've sharpened our focus even more on reducing costs. And you can see the impact on our expanded margins, as cost consciousness has become part of our DNA. Our supply chain reinvention program, now in its fifth year, is delivering strong net productivity, and we still have a long runway of opportunity ahead of us, especially as we put more of our Power Brands on to advantaged assets and continue to leverage our integrated Lean Six Sigma tools.","To aggressively reduce overheads, we've actively embraced Zero-Based Budgeting. Over the past three years, our ZBB initiative has saved over $0.5 billion in indirect costs. We're also building a global shared services capability, which leverages our scale to simplify and standardize key back-office processes. These supply chain and overhead benefits will continue to build over the next couple of years. As a result, we're well on track to deliver our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% by 2018. And we have good visibility to expand margins beyond that.","Finally, we continue to take actions to focus our portfolio, so resources can be deployed to the highest return opportunities. Most recently, we announced an agreement to sell most of our grocery business in Australia and New Zealand, including the VEGEMITE brand.","At the same time, we're strengthening our portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions in growing markets and consumer segments. For example, we've successfully integrated the Kinh Do snacks business that we acquired in 2015, enabling high single-digit growth in our Vietnam business. And in our allergy-friendly Enjoy Life Foods business, also acquired in 2015, we've expanded capacity and flexibility, with the opening of a new U.S.-based manufacturing facility in Indiana. This increased capacity enabled our recent expansion into the UK and Australia.","To summarize, 2016 was another solid year for our company. Despite the significant headwinds, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 24% at constant currency; strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 230 basis points, while returning $3.7 billion to our shareholders.","With that, let me turn the call over to Brian to review our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Overall, we performed well on a number of key metrics for the full year, and delivered solid results in light of the challenging environment that Irene just referenced. While the external environment was definitely more difficult than we planned coming into 2016, we made great progress in driving strong margin expansion and cash flow, despite the weaker top line.","Organic net revenue increased 1.3% for the year. This included the negative impact of 20 basis points from India demonetization and 90 basis points from our revenue management actions, which you'll recall include SKU rationalization, portfolio pruning, and trade optimization. While these actions do temper growth on the top line, they improved the overall quality of our portfolio, allowing us to focus on more attractive and higher-profit opportunities.","Our Power Brands continued to be the primary driver behind our growth, as they finished up nearly 3% for the year, exceeding category growth rates. Emerging markets increased 2.7%, due primarily to currency-driven pricing in inflationary markets, while developed markets grew 0.5% driven by positive vol\/mix. Vol\/mix was approximately flat for the year when excluding the impact of the India demonetization, with the second half stronger than the first. This is also a significant improvement from 2015, when vol\/mix was a negative 2.5 percentage points. For the quarter, organic revenue grew 0.6%, including Power Brands growth of nearly 2%.","We saw good results in a number of our largest countries, including Germany, China, Russia, and Mexico. But overall revenue growth was lower than our expectations, as India demonetization had a negative impact of approximately 60 basis points, and we saw weaker category growth in U.S. biscuits, the UK, and across the Middle East.","Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance. 2016 represented another strong year of adjusted OI margin expansion, as we march towards our 2018 goal of 17% to 18%. Since 2013, our adjusted OI margins are up nearly 500 basis points. Adjusted OI margin for the year was 15.3%, up 230 basis points and in line with our guidance.","We increased adjusted gross margins by 70 basis points for the year, driven by very strong net productivity. We also delivered continued reductions in overheads, resulting from our Zero-Based Budgeting and global shared services. In Q4, our adjusted OI margin grew 110 basis points, primarily through overhead reductions. As we mentioned in our last call, we made incremental investments during the quarter in areas such as white space expansions in U.S. and China chocolate. We saw a small decline in adjusted gross margins, as strong productivity gains were more than offset by short-term trade investments.","Overall, we're pleased with our margin results for the year, and remain very confident in our path to our 2018 target. We continue to run the business in a way that delivers strong margin expansion, while making critical investments behind key growth initiatives.","Let me now provide some color on our performance by region. In North America, we delivered full-year adjusted OI margin expansion of 190 basis points, primarily driven by continued overhead reductions and strong net productivity. On the top line, North America grew 1.2%, fueled by solid vol\/mix results. Biscuits growth was led by belVita, Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, and our Thins platform, which all posted solid results. Gum and candy remained soft from an overall category perspective, but Sour Patch Kids candy continued to gain momentum, posting strong growth for the full year.","In Q4, and as expected, we saw a decline in adjusted OI margins due primarily to increased A&C, including investments in U.S. chocolate. Revenue in the quarter grew 0.4% due to weak gum performance and the competitive pressures in biscuits that Irene discussed earlier.","Europe delivered strong margin growth for the year, with adjusted OI margin up 220 basis points to 18.3%. Productivity and lower overheads were the primary drivers of those gains. Organic net revenue continued to be positive, up 0.7% for both the year and the quarter, primarily driven by vol\/mix. Biscuits delivered strong growth in Germany and Russia for both the year and the quarter, while chocolate turned in solid performances in Germany and the UK for the year. In EEMEA, 2016 adjusted OI margins grew 230 basis points to 12.1%, driven by reduced overheads and solid productivity. Organic revenue increased 0.5% for the year, with growth in Australia, China, and Southeast Asia.","Fourth quarter organic revenue declined 1.2%, including the impact from India demonetization, which was an approximate $40 million headwind across all categories. Although we believe the worst of this impact has passed, we expect headwinds in the first quarter and potentially into Q2. We also saw a decline in the Middle East as the economic recession caused by low oil prices and tightening credit markets persisted.","On the flip side, we saw growth in China from biscuits, as well as good initial results from Milka chocolate, including some favorable impact from the timing of Chinese New Year. Southeast Asia delivered a strong quarter with balanced results across all categories, and continued momentum with Kinh Do. In addition, we saw the expected uplift from our initial quarter of the Japan biscuit repatriation.","In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 220 basis points to nearly 13% for the year, primarily driven by lower overheads, including VAT-related settlements as well as targeted pullbacks in A&C. Gross margins were pressured in the region as we saw significant volume reductions in our manufacturing plants. Organic net revenue increased nearly 5% for the year, led by Mexico and Argentina. Mexico grew mid single-digits, driven by balanced vol\/mix and pricing while Argentina grew double-digits as a result of pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.","Consistent with our commentary for the past several quarters, Brazil remains a challenging market. Government austerity, tight credit conditions, and high unemployment continued to temper consumption, causing consumers to trade down to lower-priced snacking options. We're pleased to see improving results on Brazil chocolate, however, as our price pack architecture efforts continued to gain traction. Although we continue to believe that Brazil will be a long-term growth engine for us, we expect the market to be challenged for the foreseeable future.","Let me now make some comments around category highlights. In aggregate, snacks category growth continued to slow in the fourth quarter, contributing to a full-year rate of 2.3%. Our growth was lower in aggregate than our categories. This was primarily a result of our revenue management actions. Biscuits grew 1.8% with strength in the UK, Germany, Russia, and Southeast Asia. belVita and Oreo posted strong results for the year. We did marginally lose share in our large U.S. biscuits business in a challenging, competitive environment. This resulted in only 35% of our biscuits revenue growing or holding share for the year.","Chocolate grew 2%, driven by solid results in Germany, the UK, and Australia. Despite a decline in Q4 from demonetization, India had a strong year. And although it's early, we're pleased with our results in China chocolate for Q4. Although the category declined overall, we achieved a 2% share and expected continued momentum in 2017. Approximately 60% of our chocolate revenue grew or held share. Gum and candy was slightly negative for the year. Solid performance in Mexico gum and U.S. candy were among the highlights. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share.","Now turning to earnings per share. For the year, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.94, which was up 24% on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven by our strong operating income performance, as well as the impact from share repurchases and lower taxes. In addition, we continue to be very pleased by the performance of our coffee equity investments. In addition to being a highly attractive and value-creating transaction for us, we believe these investments are becoming more valuable as they execute well.","Moving to cash flow and capital return, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash flow in 2016, which exceeded our outlook. Our teams continued to make excellent progress in working capital, and we believe we're now approaching best-in-class performance here.","As we've said in the past, our improving margins, lower CapEx, and a decline in future restructuring charges will position us well to deliver on our 2018 free cash flow target of approximately $2.8 billion. Q4 also capped off a strong year for capital return. For the year, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders, representing more than 220% of our net earnings. We believe this is best-in-class among our peers. During the quarter, we returned more than $1.1 billion through repurchases and dividends. For the year, we repurchased approximately $2.6 billion of our shares, and our buyback actions reflect more than a 15% reduction of shares since the spin.","Now let me share the key elements of our 2017 outlook. As Irene mentioned, our priorities and strategy remain unchanged. And as we look at the global landscape for 2017, we do expect continued economic and geopolitical uncertainties, especially in the emerging markets, but also in places like the U.S. We've built our plans for 2017 assuming that the category environment remains consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter. We believe this is an appropriately conservative stance. Even in this slower-growth environment, however, we expect to deliver another year of strong margin expansion and exceptional EPS growth. Specifically, we expect full-year organic net revenue to grow at least 1%. This outlook is built on a category growth rate as we see it today, and includes both the benefit of new white space launches, as well as our continued revenue management efforts.","I would also note that based on the timing of Easter, the Chinese New Year, continued effects of India demonetization, and the strength of our first quarter in 2016, we expect flat to slightly positive growth in the first quarter. We expect adjusted OI margin in the mid 16% range. We remain highly confident in our margin expansion execution. This outlook is based on continued progress in overhead reductions, strong net productivity, while supporting investments in our key growth initiatives and high return A&C. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our target of 17% to 18% in 2018, and continue to see improvement opportunities beyond that.","Finally, we're expecting double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. This would give us a double-digit CAGR over five years. We know of few other companies in our space that are delivering that type of performance.","I'll now turn it back to Irene for a few closing comments.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Simply put, I firmly believe we're well-positioned today and for the future. Our industry has been undergoing a period of unprecedented change and heightened volatility, and we expect this to continue in 2017. Challenging times like these demand decisive actions with a focus on creating value, both now and for the long term. Our aggressive cost management is making us nimbler, more efficient, and more productive. At the same time, we're making smart, strategic investments in our core franchises that will pay dividends for many years to come. We're clearly seeing some green shoots of growth in the brands, channels and markets where we're investing.","Of course, not everything will show results immediately or work as well as we planned, but we're not afraid to experiment and innovate in this tough environment. In fact, we believe that's the only way to create momentum in a rapidly-changing world. While we believe it's critical to manage for the long term, we're also very focused on creating value for our shareholders today, regardless of headwinds. And we've done that.","What gets me really excited, though, is this: when the macro picture improves, and we're confident that it will, the foundation we're laying today positions our company to leverage the investments we've made over the years to deliver differentiated growth on both the bottom and the top line.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. The floor is now open for your questions. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good evening, everybody, and thank you. Two for me, if I can. First, as you talked about your organic sales growth, a little bit lighter than usual, you discussed some of the headwinds. I guess, Irene, if you were maybe to size some of those headwinds, whether it's India, which you already did size, as I appreciate that, for us, competition in the U.S., global economic issues, which would you say were the most challenging in this period? And were there anything that came in, on the flip side, maybe better that you expected on that top line?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, Ken, I think we pretty much sized the main impacts without a doubt for us, given our strong presence in India and particularly our strong presence in rural India. Demonetization was a particularly significant impact. And as Brian mentioned, we expect it'll continue probably into at least through the first quarter, if not into a little bit of the second quarter.","The other one really that was different than perhaps \u2013 a little tougher than we had expected was the strong promotion spending that we saw in both the UK and the U.S. There's a lot of trade spending dollars. It didn't do very much to drive the category and, in fact, all it did was sort of margin down the business. And again, we chose to participate in that to defend our shares, but that's not the right way to build the business for the long term. And I think as our customers experience the reality of that spending, we're going to be able to get back to a more disciplined focus on innovation and brand marketing and price pack architecture. So I would say those probably were the two biggest.","Without a doubt, we continue to see a shift toward well-being products, and we are committed to participating in that shift. We saw strong performance from some of our own products like GOOD THiNS, like belVita, but we'll share with you at CAGNY our focus on really accelerating that growth, because that's where the consumer is going. So I think, without a doubt, the top line's not yet where we want it to be.","I would say, though, in answer to your second question, there are some dynamics underlying the aggregate numbers that make us feel confident that we're going to start to see some improvement as we move ahead. The first is simply the quality of the revenue. We've told you that, over time, we were going to migrate from a very price-driven revenue profile to one more driven by vol\/mix. And as you saw coming out of this year, we went from about minus 2.5% contribution of vol\/mix last year to almost flat this year, and as Brian mentioned, we saw some nice improvement as the year progressed. We're very pleased with the performance of our Power Brands. They're 70% of the revenue today. Over time, as they continue to grow faster because that's where we're making our investments, we should see that growth pick up and they will be a larger portion of our overall portfolio. But they are growing faster than our categories and we expect that that will continue.","As I mentioned, well-being products are performing well, and over time we've made a commitment that by 2020, half of our products will be in the well-being space. They're performing well, and you will see that continue to have a contribution. I feel good about the white space launches. We talked for a long time about the fact we were going to launch China chocolate, and you saw us launch chocolate in the U.S. We're feeling good. Those are early days, of course, but we're off to a good start there.","And then last but not least, obviously we're seeing a fairly significant channel shift in a number of our markets, particularly the U.S. and China, and we've invested quite significantly in eCommerce and we're very pleased with the early progress in that space. We're up about 35% year-over-year, and we're hoping that that's going to represent a $1 billion business for us over the next couple of years. So net-net, we're not quite where we want to be on the top line. We're very pleased with the strong bottom line performance that we delivered. But we do see some green shoots underlying those aggregate numbers.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful and thank you for all that. One quick follow-up for me: Some of your peers have quantified the benefit of the accounting change to stock-based comp on their earnings guidance this year. Just curious, to any degree, are you expecting this to help your earnings this year? Or is it too small to really think about?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","I would say, Ken, it's in our outlook that we've provided. It's relatively small and, as you know, it's kind of hard to predict, but it's in there.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hi, Bryan.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just one question related to the margin outlook for 2017. Brian, can you talk a little bit about sort of where your outlook is for commodity cost inflation? And also, I guess, with revenues still sort of below average, just what kind of drag you're seeing from, like, volume deleverage? Just trying to get a sense for \u2013 even though you're sort of guiding to the mid 16% for margins, it just seems like there are still some headwinds there that you're fighting to get there, and I'm trying to get a sense for what those are.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, Bryan, I would say commodities is a bit mixed. I mean, everybody have seen cocoa prices come down. And clearly, we will ultimately benefit from that. Obviously, we have a hedge program that cushions that and takes some of the volatility out. So we don't necessarily get it right away, and it'll play its way through. But there are other things that are up in that portfolio of commodities that we buy. So I would say it's a mixed bag and it's not necessarily as big a driver as it's been over the last few years from a commodity standpoint. That said, there's still markets where we have to price, and that's one of the key elements that's going to drive our performance as we move into 2017. So I think that's the fundamental view on commodities.","I think when you look at overall margins, we are assuming a similar environment as to what we see now, and we've sort of, as you would expect \u2013 I mean, it's been a weaker volume year than we would have hoped, and we've delivered very strong productivity with all the work that we've done despite that. So we've built a plan to deliver on our 2017 commitments, assuming that we have a similar environment from a top line standpoint, and not much help from volume. It will be continued focus on the programs that are taking overheads and shared services, and we have to do a better job on trade optimization. Price pack architecture will be part of that that drives through our margins.","And then we told you last summer that we're moving some dollars from CapEx, which were initially focused on capacity and driving growth. We've moved that into more restructuring, so that gives us more confidence and a bigger portfolio of programs that help us drive the margins in an environment like this. So I think we're adapting to plan and adjusting to an environment that has lower growth.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, I guess, is that part of the visibility beyond 17% and 18% margins, once you get a little bit of volume back into the model, that ought to drive some leverage that isn't there today.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Absolutely right. I mean, it changes the whole equation. If we were to get volume leverage on this thing, given what we've done with margins, it's a pretty powerful engine.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel Capital.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, Chris.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Maybe just to follow on Bryan's question there, just to be clear, do you expect then \u2013 I heard you talk about some pricing in some markets that's going to be sporadic, it sounds like. And how would that balance against volume growth? Do you expect volume growth for the year in 2017?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","I think it feels a lot like what we saw this year, Chris. The pricing we need to do \u2013 I mean, there are some selected markets where it's rather extreme where we've seen devaluations in Egypt and Nigeria that has forced us to act very quickly with some significant pricing. But the rest of it \u2013 a lot of it will come from things like price pack architecture and revenue management. It won't be like we saw in 2015, which was broad-based across many markets. So that's just part of the equation that we've got to drive this year and I think we're in reasonable shape in terms of executing those things heading into the year.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just a question for you on the gross margin. As we consider the supply chain savings coming through as well as some continued overhead cost control, can you give an idea of \u2013 I thought the savings would accrue more so to the gross margin in 2017. Is that true? And the gross margin was a little weaker than I thought in the fourth quarter, perhaps that's more volume and revenue-driven.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","It is. I mean, gross margin has been and it'll continue to be a key driver, as we think about the margin expansion and the commitments we have. Supply chain execution has gone well. It does set us up for productivity as we move over the next couple of years. So, gross margin will continue to be important. And if volumes come back, it obviously is a much more significant driver.","As you look at the fourth quarter dynamic on gross margin, we had very strong productivity, so I think the underlying performance was very good. We had a couple unplanned items. Obviously, the lost volume in some of these markets: India, Middle East, Brazil. We saw a few markets, as we said, that had extreme currency devaluations where you really can't price fast enough to catch up. And then the trade spending. I mean, those were the dynamics that played out across the gross margin line as you look at the fourth quarter. So it'll continue to be a driver. You can't count on it every quarter. It's going to be a little bit lumpy. But we feel confident in the initiatives that are going to drive gross margin expansion.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So, for the year, could it be up in line with your operating \u2013 the expected operating margin expansion? Is that realistic?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, I don't want to get into the individual line. We want to be held accountable for the OI margin expansion and we've got good plans to get there across both overheads and gross margins.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good evening, everybody.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I guess, two questions, one just to finish up this gross margin conversation. I guess, the target I think that was thrown out maybe at CAGNY about a year ago was in 2018 I think gross margins of 42% to 43%. I guess, at this stage, it sounds like at least in this current volume environment, maybe it's slightly below that, maybe the SG&A piece around overheads and whatnot just picks up a little more steam as you lean in a little more heavily on that. Is that generally what you're sort of trying to get at? Or should we not abandon the 42% to 43% just yet?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. Look, I think we'll talk a little bit about it at CAGNY this year. But it's clearly a different volume environment than we would've thought about, as we laid that out. So we'll give you a little bit of a sense for how we're thinking about that. I think you can have confidence that we have multiple paths to get there and we're chasing initiatives that are going to drive gross margin and overheads and the SG&A line.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, Irene, I guess, a question that's relevant for Mondel\u0113z, but maybe a bit broader also and it's kind of relevant for the group as a whole. I'm trying to get a sense of, at what point, I guess, do sort of multi-year margin targets that not just Mondel\u0113z have put out, but others, maybe become a bit counterproductive. Maybe if those margins ultimately come on a sales base that maybe is much lower than planned. I guess, at some point, how do you balance the, hey, should we push out a margin target in order to make sure we kind of stabilize our sales base the way we need to. I'm just trying to get a sense in a broader sense of how you think about that.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","I do think our balance between top and bottom is one of the things that distinguishes us. I think we are uniquely well-positioned because of the nature of our portfolio, strong brands, a strong geographic footprint, strong routes to market with a good infrastructure, all of that is why we continue to make investment even in this challenging environment. So, without a doubt, we have pulled back a little bit. We've been pretty clear with our investors as to where those pullbacks have been, but we're one of the few companies that is delivering significant earnings growth while at the same time continuing to make those investments. And I think that is something that will continue to differentiate us, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","See you in Florida.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","See you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","See you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thank you and good evening.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, David.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I wanted to ask about your thoughts here on this border-adjusted tax proposal. What do you assess that on your operations? And then kind of related to this, how much margin improvement is in your forecast from your Mexican\/Salinas operations for the 2018 margin goals?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. David, I mean, we obviously spend a lot of time talking about this. It's hard not to see it play out. But it's very difficult and I think in this discussion a little early to speculate on what it would mean to us in terms of the impact of a border adjustment tax. As you know \u2013 I mean, we are a very global company. We've structured it successfully in a way that allows us to run it efficiently and serve our customers, consumers around the world, while delivering strong returns. And this has enabled us to create a competitive and, I would say, advantaged global tax structure and low cash taxes as part of what we do in delivering our results.","So, to directly really respond to the specific question, I would just say that we do import from Mexico and other parts of the world into the U.S. Our imports represent a minority of our U.S. revenues and profits. And as I said, we're not going to do anything to adjust our operations or plans until we really know what the policies are going to be, and they're much more concrete. So, I mean, we're very involved, we're watching developments. We've got a voice in this process of providing feedback. And to the extent that we face higher costs for imported products, we'd obviously need to look for ways to cover these costs, adapt our supply chain model. And we do that over time.","So, in terms of how much incremental benefit associated with Mexico or Salinas, we are, I would say, fairly well utilized in that facility at this point. And we don't have right now at this point additional plans to move any additional production to Mexico. So I would say it's contributing. You've seen the results in North America in terms of our margin expansion. Obviously, that's part of it. And we have \u2013 it's important to note, we've made significant investments in our U.S. assets as well and we continue to make investments here. We've invested over the last few years over almost $0.5 billion in our existing U.S. manufacturing footprint in U.S. plants. So it's a mixed bag. And that has, David, contributed to the margin expansion as well. We've seen great margin expansion from the U.S. plants as well.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So bottom line, would you say it's fair, though, that both Brexit and border-adjusted taxes kind of throw out some big questions about how it'll impact the company. But just right as of yet with no actual definition as to exactly what's going in, you can't really assess it right now, so you stick with your 2018 margin targets. Is that where we are?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, look, I think it's a very global business with \u2013 for all the positive things that come from that, I mean, we've got exposures to some of these questions. We're watching the developments. We'll manage our way through it. And we will adjust as appropriate as we move forward. And we'll keep you posted as we learn more.","David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good evening, folks.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you for letting me ask a question. Just a couple housekeeping items for me. I apologize if I missed it. Undoubtedly, I did miss it. But can you give us your expectation for all-in revenue growth in fiscal 2017?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Well, we gave you organic net revenue of at least 1%, is what we said, Jason.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, no, I heard that. But there's FX and there's some other moving pieces.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What were your guidance \u2013 in terms of net sales, what your guidance is predicated on?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. The other thing we provided in the release would have been 1% headwind from currency on the top line.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thank you. Sorry for the nuance question.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yep.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And the other housekeeping item, the VAT tax benefit, I think you mentioned that in your prepared remarks in terms of LatAm contribution to margins. How big was that?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","We disclosed it in the third quarter. I think it was disclosed as about $35 million. We had an additional smaller amount in the fourth quarter. So I would say it's \u2013 we've had this over the last couple years from time to time. And it contributed in the LatAm business, I would say, about 80 basis points on the full year in terms of their profit. 80 basis points in terms of the \u2013 versus prior year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay, thank you. As promised, I was going to keep it short with the housekeeping. I'll pass it on.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good evening, everyone.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, Alexia.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Just two quick ones. Firstly, you alluded to promotional spending intensifying in the U.S. during this last quarter. I wasn't quite sure whether the idea was that it wasn't very effective and everybody's given up on it at this point, or whether it's likely to continue. That was the first question.","And then the second one, I guess, linked, ad spend and consumer advertising spending, how much was that up year-on-year in the fourth quarter? What was the margin headwinds and how much more have you got to go in 2017 versus 2016? Thank you very much.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","So I would say it wasn't particularly effective, but that doesn't mean everybody will stop. So I can't forecast that. What I will tell you is we certainly are going to be a little bit more disciplined as we think about how we want to spend our money. Again, we did not see the kind of returns that we had hoped for and, in fact, it basically took our spending away from some of the other longer-term equity-building activities. So you're going to see us continue to migrate our spending. But I would say our customers, at the end of the day, if it doesn't grow the \u2013 if the spending that goes into it does not grow the category, I think our customers over time will look at other tactics as well. In terms of A&C in the fourth quarter...","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, I'll take it. I would say, Alexia, for the total year, essentially flat, at slightly above 9% I think as we've talked about. In the quarter, it was slightly down. I mean, we made some conscious decisions while we did invest in some key markets in the key white spaces. You think about India, you think about what happened in the Middle East, you think about some of the other markets where we saw challenges, we did pull back intentionally. So about flat for the year. As you know and we've talked about, we continue to mix towards digital, which has created for us more room and is cheaper obviously than traditional. We've benefited from some ZBB work here and we've also continued to distort to the Power Brands. So moving A&C and spending it in the right places I think we've gotten better at that. But in general, about flat.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And for 2017, pretty much the same?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not going to provide specifics. I would say probably slightly up is the overall framework.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you. I'll pass it on.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you. I wanted to dive a little bit more into biscuits in the U.S. because this commentary came up in third quarter that competition had intensified and it sounded like Mondel\u0113z intended to do something about it. And with the Nabisco brand, you're obviously a big category leader. So what steps did you take to respond? And why do you think it didn't pan out the way you hoped for in fourth quarter?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, Rob, I would say we have made terrific progress in our U.S. biscuit business in terms of margin expansion over the last couple of years. If you look at North America, it's up 540 basis points, and that's almost largely the U.S. And that's been our primary focus. And at the same time, over these last couple of years, we've been able to continue to grow our share. This last year, the net of it is that we had a lot of moving parts going on in terms of our transformation activities, and I would say with hindsight, some of the optimization that we did, for example, in our DSD selling organization had more of an impact on the execution than I would have liked. And so we did see some impact in the short term. And as I mentioned in an answer to some of the earlier questions, we have seen a very challenging retailer environment, which has really caused a lot of promotional spending, which hasn't necessarily helped the overall category.","Looking ahead, we have some very strong programs in place in 2017 and, frankly, a lot of those began as we exited the year. We're going to continue to invest in price pack architecture. As I've talked about it, as we got our supply chain \u2013 most of our supply chain activities behind us, we now have the capability and much more flexibility to offer a variety of pack sizes for our products. So, for example, we've got a family pack at one of our key customers that's doing exceptionally well. It took us a while to get that pack out the door. We are continuing to innovate, particularly in the well-being space. I mentioned GOOD THiNS and talked about the fact that you'll see a lot more of the items that we have coming in at CAGNY in a couple of weeks. And we're continuing to increase marketing investment behind programs with good ROI. We've got a very significant program behind our Oreo business this year, as well as a number of our other core franchises.","So some of it was a messy fourth quarter that turned out to not play out quite as well as we had hoped, but at the same time, I think the business is well staged with one of the strongest innovation pipelines and the strongest price pack architecture capabilities that's going to allow us not only to address occasion opportunities, but also to penetrate some channels that we haven't been as strong in.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. It's late. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Rob.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for questions. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Two quick questions for me. The first would be for Irene. Just on the non-Power Brands part of the portfolio, that's down 1.9% in the quarter. Can you kind of speak to whether the market share losses are more pronounced in this portion of the portfolio relative to Power Brands? And are we seeing just an under-investment in those pocket of brands right now because of where emerging markets stand today? Just any kind of forward-looking strategy about how we think about, that would be helpful.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yes. Simple answer, Steven, is yes, Power Brands actually performed better in terms of overall market share. In fact, we actually grew share in Power Brands. So, some of the decline is coming from the non-Power Brands, but I would tell you that global Power Brands did exceptionally well. Our regional Power Brands was a bit of a mixed bag this past year because many of them are prominent in the emerging markets. So you think about a brand like Lacta chocolate in Brazil, for example, that given the macroeconomic conditions did not have a particularly strong year. So we did see some of these regional brands perform a little bit less well. But our focus going forward is to continue to distort our spending behind these Power Brands. They have the best margins. They've got the best growth trajectory. And that will allow us to continue to offset some of the declines in the other brands.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then a follow-up for Brian. Brian, did you comment on what the SKU rationalization drag is going to be for 2017? And then lastly, should we think of equity income from JVs as up slightly from last year? Thanks.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. In terms of equity income, I would assume we're planning on relatively close to what they did this year, maybe a little bit better, not significant improvement. They're facing into green coffee inflation, especially in Robusta. So it's a bit of a challenge that they're working through. And, Steven, what was your first?","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","The SKU rationalization drag for 2017.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Oh, SKU rationalization, yeah. All I said and what we'll continue to say, it's smaller than we would have had in 2016 and we're not going to specifically break it out.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Great.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining Mondel\u0113z International's fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.","Shep Dunlap","Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out two press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors.","During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks, Shep, and good morning. Q3 was a good quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Organic net revenue 2.8% fueled marginally by the strength of our Power Brands improving momentum in emerging markets and strong performance in Europe. We estimate that our top-line results included a benefit of approximately 60 basis points associated with recovery from the malware incident as we recaptured some delayed shipments from the end of Q2.","Of course, we had some challenges in the quarter from hurricanes, earthquakes and the India GST, but they netted out to a very small number. On the bottom line, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted operating income margin expansion and double digit adjusted EPS growth. We're pleased with the underlying growth drivers. Our Power Brands grew 3.8%, significantly outpacing the category with Milka and Cadbury Dairy Milk in chocolate and Oreo and belVita in biscuits performing especially well.","Emerging markets grew 4.8% including positive volume growth. Key markets have fueled revenue growth included India, Russia and Mexico. We think sequential acceleration in emerging market category growth consistent with our view that these markets are generally improving and we\u2019re well positioned to win as conditions continue to improve. Developed markets grew 1.6%, led once again by Europe.","Our performance in chocolate was strong across nearly all of our largest markets in the region. For example, in Germany, we expanded market share on a year-to-date basis with distribution gains and the solid performance of Milka. And in the UK, our Cadbury sponsorship of the Premier League also drove strong share gains. Our growth strategies continue to gain traction. We're contemporizing our core by distorting resources behind our Power Brands and by upgrading the well being credentials of our portfolio.","Our belVita brand continues to be a standout. It\u2019s growing mid single digits globally driven by our base breakfast biscuits as well as impactful line extensions like belVita Protein and belVita Bites. RITZ Crisp & Thins with all the taste and half the fat of the leading potato chip is taking share and exceeding our expectations. We\u2019re also increasing our presence in convenience stores. Thanks to our more flexible price pack architecture. And we successfully launched a new savory snack brand, V\u00e9a, during the quarter. We're off to a good start as we ramp up distribution.","We continue to make good progress as we fill geographic white spaces. Milka Oreo chocolate in the U.S. is performing well and we recently expanded our offerings to include Milka Oreo mint. The repatriation of our Nabisco brand in Japan is also going well as we recently launched Oreo THiNS and new RITZ sandwich biscuits. And in China, our Milka brand has established a solid beachhead in the chocolate market in its first year.","Finally, we continue to drive sales and channel ubiquity for our iconic brands with especially strong progress in e-commerce. Across the globe, we delivered net revenue growth of more than 40% fueled by key markets like China and the U.S. In fact our U.S. e-commerce net revenues have grown more than 70% year-to-date and our China e-commerce business grew at twice the growth rate of the online market. These strong results reinforce our belief in the importance and future potential of e-commerce as the key snacking channel and we've taken the necessary steps to capitalize on that opportunity.","Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me comment briefly on North America, which is our only region performing below expectations. We're pleased to have returned North America to positive growth in the quarter and we're making progress in addressing the challenges we\u2019ve discussed previously including recovery from the malware incident. Importantly, we're encouraged by the momentum on some of the strategic initiatives that I mentioned earlier including Milka Oreo chocolate and the rollout of our pipeline of wellbeing innovations and renovations.","Additionally, we continue to see our direct store delivery system as a competitive advantage and expect the benefits of this system to play out more clearly in the coming months. That said we have more work to do for this region to deliver its full potential. We look forward to the arrival of Glen Walter next month. Gradually just named as the North America Region President brings an impressive track record of building brands and driving growth in North America and internationally. His operating and sales background has prepared him well to lead our North American business.","As we hand the reigns over to Glen, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Tim Coffer, who graciously served as Interim President over the past six months in addition to his role as Chief Growth Officer. Tim and his team has significant strengthened the business fundamentals and positioned it for future growth.","Let me now turn it over to Brian to provide more detail on the financials.","Brian Gladden","Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our results in the third quarter, which played out roughly as we expected. Organic net revenue was up 2.8% driven by strength in Power Brands, emerging markets and Europe. As Irene mentioned, we've benefited from the positive net impact of 60 basis points related to the recovery from malware related shipment delays in the second quarter. However as we said to expect on our last call, we also experienced some additional malware related disruptions in the third quarter in certain markets and that negative impact was most pronounced in North America.","Overall, we estimate that the year-to-date negative impact from the malware incident was approximately 60 basis points to organic net revenue or just over $100 million of lost revenue across the business. Importantly, we're now confident that the issues are substantially behind us and we're back to pre-incident levels of service and operation stability. Emerging markets grew nicely at 4.8%. Our geographic footprint has always been one of the most compelling strengths of our long-term vision for profitable and sustainable growth. And we continue to see positive momentum in many of these countries in terms of macro conditions, our share performance, improved category fundamentals and good balance between vol\/mix and pricing.","Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance. We continued to improve margins with another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion. Adjusted OI margin was 16.9%, an increase of 130 basis points driven by ongoing overhead reductions with improved performance across all regions outside of North America. Our efforts in ZBB, supply chain reinvention and global shared services continue to deliver results and we see more opportunities in front of us. Adjusted gross margins declined 60 basis points. Although we delivered improvements in volume and solid net productivity, these benefits were offset by inflation in dairy costs and select investments and trade spending.","We are pricing in our cheese business to offset the dairy inflation and should be more balanced as we enter 2018. On the trade spending, we increased spend in a targeted way in North America as part of our DSD initiatives and in Russia and France where we're seeing good growth and strong returns. We continue to feel good about our mid-term gross margin opportunity for a few reasons.","First, we're delivering strong net productivity at around 3% on a year-to-date basis; improving volume trends, which we saw this quarter, will also provide cost leverage as we move forward. Second, we're starting to see the transactional benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar in some markets. So, it's still early and there were always be some markets that are exceptions, but this is a good trend for us. In total, our gross margins are up approximately 300 basis points since 2013 and we see continued gross margin expansion as an important component of our 2018 margin delivery. So we feel good about the adjusted OI margin performance and remain on track to deliver a mid 16% outlook for the year. We also remain committed to our 17% to 18% margin target for 2018.","Let me now turn to our regional performance. Three of our four regions delivered good results building on the underlying trends from the first half of the year. Europe delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion with an increase in adjusted OI margin of 70 basis points to 19.4%. Strong net productivity and ongoing overhead reductions drove the improvement. Organic net revenue increased 3.2% including a benefit due to the recovery from the malware incident. Our Power Brands in this region continue to perform well driven by solid vol\/mix growth.","As Irene mentioned, our European chocolate business delivered strong results in nearly all of our large markets while both the U.K. and Germany turned in good performances in biscuits including Oreo, which was up double digits. Our growth was also fueled by our chocobakery business, which generated double digit increases in Q3 driven by new product launches including Milka brownie and Cadbury Roundies.","Our EMEA region delivered strong growth of approximately 3%. Similar to last quarter, Asia Pacific performed well while the Middle East was mixed as challenging economic conditions continued though we are beginning to see easier compares. Adjusted OI margin increased 80 basis points to 13% driven by lower A&C spend as we selectively pulled back in markets like the Middle East where we\u2019ve seen lower ROIs and overhead reductions.","Our India revenue grew double digits as our chocolate franchise grew share behind ongoing momentum in our core successful new launches such as Fuse and Silk Oreo. China returned to growth in the quarter. Our Biscuits business improved as we launched low single-digit growth, as we delivered low single-digit growth led by our Oreo relaunch. In addition, our e-commerce investments continued to drive solid share gains. Our gum business also grew share while milk and chocolate was inline with expectations.","In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 200 points to 17.7%, primarily driven by lower overhead costs and improved net productivity. Organic net revenue grew 5.4%, which includes a positive impact from the recovery of malware-related shipments. Mexico continued to deliver solid growth, driven by strength in candy while growth in Argentina was led by pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.","In Brazil, improving dynamics in chocolate drove a fourth straight quarter of growth. And as we've said, our Biscuits business continued to face headwinds from price gaps and downtrading. In response, we're making appropriate adjustments to increase the range of our portfolio. Overall, Brazil was up low single digits in the quarter. Turning to North America. Organic net revenue grew 1%. These results were driven by an increase in U.S. Biscuits, partially offset by lower gum revenue. As I said, malware-related disruptions continue to present challenges. The good news is that we now believe that these issues are substantially behind us.","As Irene mentioned, we still believe the DSD model provides us with a number of competitive advantages. While the persistent malware-related issues impacted our ability to capture the initial market share opportunities in the quarter, we remain confident that we will see incremental share gains as we move to the next few quarters. Despite the challenges in North America, it's encouraging to see the improved trajectory in our revenue performance and some recent improvement in category growth.","Now let me spend a few moments providing some highlights by category. Snacking category growth improved incrementally on a year-to-date basis, now at 1.8%, but our overall share results were mixed. Our Biscuits business was essentially flat, driven by strength in key countries such as the U.K. and Germany, offset by year-to-date weakness in the U.S., which was partially driven by malware-related issues early in the quarter. Approximately 30% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held in this category. As our DSD initiatives gain traction, we expect to see improvements in this metric.","In chocolate, our business grew mid-single digits, driven by strong results in India, the UK, Germany and Russia. The U.S. chocolate expansion also continued to be a solid contributor to growth. Approximately 65% year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category. In fact, our chocolate business has gained more share this year than any other competitor in the market.","Gum & Candy declined mid-single digits as gum category weakness persisted, most notably in the U.S. Only about 20% of our year-to-date revenue in Gum & Candy gained or held share. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, our focus is on stabilizing our share within the category while migrating our portfolio toward candy and mints to meet consumers' refreshments needs.","Turning to earnings per share. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.57, up 12% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by our strong operating income growth. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth on a constant currency basis for the full year. We also continued to reward our shareholders with strong return of capital. In the quarter, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As you know, we recently raised our dividend by 16%. As our long-term free cash flow improves, we're targeting to grow our dividend faster than adjusted EPS.","Let me review our outlook for the year. We now expect an organic net revenue growth of approximately 1%, given the large \u2013 larger-than-expected magnitude of the lost revenue related the malware incident. We still expect to deliver adjusted OI margin in the mid-16% range and double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We now expect no currency impact for the year. And with respect to free cash flow, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2 billion for the year.","In summary, many of our global markets and categories are improving, and we remain focused on driving improved top line performance while maintaining discipline around operational efficiency and margin expansion. We're encouraged as we see macro trends that have been headwinds over the past several quarters turn more favorable, including improving GDP, global consumer trends and accelerating category growth in emerging markets and more favorable exchange rates in both developed and emerging markets.","In addition, many of our recent growth investments are delivering solid results, including in well-being, in white space expansion and in penetrating other channels, especially e-commerce. As a result, we remain confident that we're well positioned to deliver sustainable growth on both the top and bottom lines over the long term.","Now let me turn it back to Irene for some concluding remarks.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks Brian. For the past three months, we've been preparing for a smooth transition as Dirk Van de Put takes over as CEO next month. Dirk has already been engaged in our 2018 financial planning process, and over the next few weeks, he'll be spending time getting immersed in the business as he begins working with our management team, our board and other key stakeholders. And of course, we expect our strategic planning process will be a key focus for Dirk in the first half of 2018.","It's hard to believe that earlier this month marked the 5-year anniversary of Mondelez International. I'm very proud of the company we built and the shareholder value we've delivered over that time. I'm pleased to see the macro environment and the underlying business momentum beginning to improve, and I'm confident that Dirk and the team will build on this momentum to take our company to the next level. It's been a privilege to have created and led this great company and a pleasure to have worked with all of you over the years. I especially want to thank my partner, Brian Gladden, and the rest of my leadership team as well as my 90,000 colleagues around the world for your passion, your hard work and your tireless commitment to our company in the exceptionally challenging environment over the past few years. Through it all, you kept your eyes on the prize, and I truly believe the best is yet to come.","With that let\u2019s open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thank you.","Ken Goldman","Hi thank you. And Irene, thank you for your help over the years and best of luck to you ahead. I get the feeling that you'll have a more active retirement than most retirees out there, knowing you. So again, thanks again.","I wanted to ask two questions if I could. You talked about your commitment to your margin target for next year, but you also talked about the process of strategic planning still being underway. So Irene, if I could ask you sort of put on your Chairman of the Board hat right now. And knowing Dirk, what are his thoughts in terms of the margin targets for next year? Is there much of a risk, in your view, of him tweaking the data a little bit? Sometimes, new CEOs come in and want to set the bar a little bit lower. So that would be my first question is sort of what your thoughts on that.","And my second question is and I think you sort of highlighted this a little in your optimism about the environment, but how do you feel, in general, about the environment for you in 2018 and in terms of the sales line? And do you feel like you'll need to invest more in gross margin to kind of hit your sales numbers or is the macro trend going to be enough? Thank you for that.","Irene Rosenfeld","So first of all Ken, I\u2019m sure you'll have a chance to engage with Dirk over the coming months. He's actually going to officially start on November 20. He's been involved in a number of areas, as I mentioned, particularly the development of the 2018 plan to ensure a smooth transition. So we start there. Brian continues to confirm our margin target for 2018 between 17% and 18%. But certainly, our strategic plan will be a key focus of Dirk\u2019s in the first half of the year.","That said, we fully understand that the margin targets are very much top of mind, and I can assure you that Dirk fully appreciates the importance of margin delivery to our overall algorithm. So I think in the spirit of you've got to wail until he gets here, I think we can give you as much assurance as that.","Brian Gladden","Ken, I would just say obviously to deliver on 2018, the plans and actions are underway. I mean, it's not like we can decide that in January and deliver. So there's been a lot of work and Dirk has been very engaged in that process. We also gave you some clarity so we're not giving guidance today obviously for 2018, but we've confirmed the margin target and we've talked about cash flow. We still feel good about $2.8 billion of cash flow for next year. So may be those are two hints as to where we're headed.","In terms of the trends that we're seeing in the environment, maybe just a few comments and we've talked about most of these. But the global economy's consumer sentiment, generally improving in most markets. Emerging markets favorable and obviously, that's good for us, given our exposure but I would also say that Europe feels pretty good. It's about 40% of our revenue and it's solid and stable and growing.","Category trends, yes, I'd say they've stabilized a bit and some recent improvement over the last couple of months but maybe a little too early to start the call that yet but not a bad trend. North America packaged food trends, I think that will continue to be a challenge, and that's a place that we're planning for that environment to continue. Commodities and currency, I guess I would say they appear to be, for us, relatively stable year-over-year and how you think about that in aggregate. We obviously have favorability in cocoa but we're all set with pressure in things like packaging, and dairy and transportation even. So maybe some overall tailwind there but we're planning for relatively stable. And then maybe the last piece, just as we think about tax \u2013 tax rates, probably roughly the same in 2018 as what we would see in 2018 short of getting some clarity on what U.S. reform looks like.","So maybe a few pieces of insight as we think about the environment and how we're thinking about 2018 without really giving you the guidance at this point.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hey good morning everybody, or good afternoon, I mean and best of luck to you Irene.","Irene Rosenfeld","Thanks Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","So a couple of questions. First, I guess as a follow-up to Ken\u2019s question, first just gross margins in the quarter were I guess down versus last year, but operating profit margins expanded. So just in terms of how the P&L shaped, how is that relative to what your expectations were I guess going into the quarter. Meaning, I guess were gross margins in line better or worse than what you were thinking?","Brian Gladden","Look, I think they were a little bit tougher. As I said, higher input costs specifically very fast have been challenging over the course of the last several months here. And we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re now in the process of raising prices, just can\u2019t really raise them fast enough. And then the trade spend, I think we were thoughtful and knew we were going to make some of those \u2013 some of those decisions to spend some of those dollars.","But look, I would just go back to mid-term reality around gross margins. We\u2019ve delivered 300 basis points improvement, it\u2019s about half of the expansion that we\u2019ve delivered over the last few years. And we\u2019re executing pretty well, I mean our execution was as expected around net productivity and the COGS reduction program that we have. So I think the one out layer was really very fast and how we sort to have to manage that across the cheese business.","Bryan Spillane","And then I guess my second question. Just if emerging markets in Europe continue to get a little bit better as we\u2019re looking out, I guess into 2018 and 2019 maybe, can you just talk about how much flexibility there is to invest behind that in your current plans. And I guess if volumes actually start to grow is \u2013 how that affects leverage and maybe the margin expansion. We\u2019ve been also focused on cost reductions to drive margins, but could you get sense that there\u2019s some volume growth, just how that might affect the margins and margin expansion?","Brian Gladden","Yes, Brian. I mean that\u2019s obviously we saw the early stages of some volume improvement a lot of it was driven by Europe in the quarter. But obviously that helped us a lot as you think about volume absorption, plant leverage and the capacity equation in the manufacturing world. So I think that\u2019s going to be \u2013 as we think about next year and look at the trends, it encouraging to see some of that volume improvement. And we feel good about the that the underlying dynamics in emerging markets.","That is \u2013 we've been distorting to Power Brands. We've been distorting to some of these markets that have seen improvements and India is probably the best example where we\u2019ve been able to put some additional spending up against growth, and I think we\u2019ve seen very good returns for that. So it\u2019s part for the course in terms of our strategy. And I think you\u2019ll see us react as these markets get better be able to put some additional spending supply.","Irene Rosenfeld","We also don\u2019t underestimate the impact that the volatile commodities as well as the strong dollar had in terms of our pricing actions, which then put a lot of pressure on volume. So one of the reasons the macro environment improvement is encouraging, is it\u2019s going to allow us to temper a lot of those actions, which should also in turn help volume in addition to the other actions we\u2019re taking.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital.","Andrew Lazar","Good afternoon.","Brian Gladden","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Irene, I was hoping maybe to get a little more perspective from you \u2013 particularly as you head off into whatever you\u2019ll do next, really on the state of the industry. I guess you\u2019ve worked on many different brands and categories, multiple capacities for various companies. And I think even your tenure. I guess my question is, is this time different, because if one listen to many of the headlines about the death of brands and private label taking over and all the rhetoric from retailers and so on. I guess one would be like to think that this time is different even of the industry\u2019s weathered many disruptive forces before and seemingly always found ways to thrive. So I guess, I was hopefully to get perspective there to bolder actions need to be taken. And I know it\u2019s a broad question, but you\u2019ve sat it kind of the nexus of many of these forces for some time and I mean your unvarnished perspective would be valuable?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes, I think as we \u2013 as I have witnessed the evolution of the industry they have been cosmic changes every couple of years throughout that tenure, whether you think about the advent of the supercenter, you think about the rise \u2013 the beginning of the rise of e-commerce. We have seen many different trends and those companies that have been successful have seen those trends coming and have address them.","So I don\u2019t think this is radically different, I do think the speed of the changes is perhaps more itself more pronounced than we might have seen in the past. But I have great confidence as we look ahead particularly to what we\u2019re seeing going on the consumer front, the customer front, and the channel shift that we\u2019re well positioned. But I do think companies have to take those cosmic changes quite seriously, and have to adapt accordingly. But I don\u2019t believe that this is a radically different set of circumstances than we would have seen in the past. They\u2019re different, but we\u2019ve seen a fairly sizable evolution in our industry over the last decade and the winners have adapted to it accordingly.","Andrew Lazar","Yes, okay. Thanks for your thoughts and all the best going forward.","Operator","And your next question comes along though Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Good evening everyone.","Brian Gladden","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","First of all, thank you Irene for your help over the years, and all the best with whatever comes next. Couple of questions. I\u2019m personally on the trade investment that you\u2019ve called out this quarter is pressuring the gross margin. Could you give us a little bit more color on where by geography and by category those might have been steps up? And do you expect those to accelerate going forward?","And then the second follow-up question is really around North America. It feels as though there hasn\u2019t been the big push behind the North American chocolate launch, you mentioned that in the prepared remarks. But we had a really seen a big marketing campaign, I don\u2019t believe yet. And similarly with the [indiscernible] taking advantage of Kellogg\u2019s system again you alluded to that being things, that yet to come. Could you just comment on whether we really are going to see some meaningful step ups there? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.","Brian Gladden","I\u2019ll take the first part on trade spend. As I said, the first place that you would have seen that was North America we made some decisions to put some trade spend to work as part of the conversations that we\u2019re having around the DSD transition. I would say given the malware issues we haven\u2019t quite seen that payoff yet, but we feel good about the payback on those decisions and that\u2019ll play out as we said over the next couple of quarters. The others were really European markets, Russia would be one, France we put some trade spend in play and again we feel like those are high ROI decisions. We more or less moved advertising and consumer promotion spend into trade, and we\u2019ve got good payback for that and you would see that in the shared data in those markets.","Irene Rosenfeld","As we think about Alexia, as we look to the balance of the year. As we said, we have \u2013 we think we\u2019re pretty well positioned to begin to capitalize on the opportunity in North America. We have significantly put the malware issues behind us as Brian mentioned. We are starting to see the hard work of Tim Coffer and his team has done to stabilize the business and improve our execution. We saw the fifth category turn positive for the first time this year. And we\u2019ve got a number of investments some of which you\u2019ve mentioned that are starting to come into the marketplace. They launch at the end of July. They\u2019ll be the protein is now fully in the market and doing well. Our Ritz share continues to grow behind RITZ Crisp & Thins. We\u2019re pleased with the momentum on U.S. chocolate. We\u2019re up to a great start there both in terms of velocity and repeat rates.","So we have a number of the elements that are starting to come together and we are quite optimistic as we look to the fourth quarter and then out into our 2018. Obviously Glen Walter\u2019s arrival will be an important catalyst to build on all of this momentum. But we are quite optimistic as we look ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from long line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Great, hi, everyone. And Irene best of luck to you as well. I just had one more follow-up question on North America. The message still seems to be pretty cautious on the near to mid term outlook, but as I look at results in the third quarter, sales improved quite a bit sequentially, and we\u2019re probably essentially in line with our expectations, and maybe a bit ahead of consensus despite the fact that you have these additional malware headwinds. So I guess, I\u2019m just wondering, is that a reflection in the short term of comps or was there any acceleration in shipments around the innovation pipeline. And then if you move through the process of shelf resets in the biscuit category, can you give us a sense for how that process tracked versus your expectations?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes. So the year-over-year comparison should not have been \u2013 the year ago should not have been a factor. We are truly starting to see our execution come together, obviously we were flying blind in \u2013 on some of our inventory for some of our products over the course of the summer time. But as we exited Q3 most of those issues as we said are substantially result. We are seeing retailers begin to reset their shelves. We\u2019re seeing our displays in share of shelf increasing and we should see that play through as we\u2019ve said in our biscuit shares for the balance of the year. So we are not particularly bullish on the near term North American market. But we do believe that our business within that environment should start to pick up.","Matthew Grainger","Okay.","Brian Gladden","Yes, I think it\u2019s little early and we\u2019re seeing some improvement in the overall category trends in there in North American U.S. biscuits. But I think it\u2019s a really early to declare that that\u2019s headed in the right direction.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great, thanks. And just I guess one more question on biscuits on more of a global scale. Obviously there were some malware related issues in North America. But the market share trends in terms of gaining in holding did weekend sequentially, is that principally a reflection of that malware shifts are there any other areas of market share pressure globally maybe just sort of hotspots from pricing perspective that would have showed up in the quarter?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes. No Matthew, really that the major pressure on the biscuit \u2013 our global biscuit share was North America, in fact if our U.S. biscuit had held share, our biscuits would\u2019ve been growing at around 80% would have been growing. So it\u2019s all about the turnaround in North America. And as we\u2019ve said we have good confidence that we will start to see that improve?","Brian Gladden","And the lost revenue related to malware, the majority came that\u2019s truly stuck is what consumptions within North America and in U.S. biscuits.","Operator","And your next question comes from the Steven Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good afternoon. Two questions. The first one be for Brian. Can you help us understand the implied fourth quarter revenue acceleration, X the shift specifically giving some better textures so what\u2019s driving the underlying baseline improvement, you call out emerging markets I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything else that you\u2019ve put upon a point on, and I got a question for Irene.","Brian Gladden","Yes, look I think there\u2019s reasonably good momentum in the majority of the emerging markets. I would call out two unusual to give us a little bit of help in the fourth quarter. The first being the year-over-year impacted demonetization in India. And then the second would be inventory trade stock levels especially in the Middle East where we had some adjustments. So I think those are two things that give us a little bit better number and in terms of reported results. But the momentum in general is good and that we see continuing.","Steven Strycula","Okay, great. And then Irene, if you had another two or three years in your current role, who would you think would be the largest payback or quickest payback on investments that you could have out there for your business, would it be greater sales force internationally in emerging markets what would be the quickest and large payback on your investment?","Irene Rosenfeld","You know I have I actually think as we see the economy recovering around the world, I think we\u2019re seeing very good payback in both our developed and our emerging markets. So I would have told you a couple of years ago that the big return would have come from emerging markets. As we've watched the challenges in those markets over the last couple of years, that's been less evident. And at this point, we're getting a very nice return on our investments in Europe. And as North America comes back, we expect to see that as well. Those are our highest margin markets in the world and so that's a great place to invest. But at the same time, we are seeing our category growth come back quite dramatically in the emerging markets. And so that's \u2013 we're being quite planful in terms of thinking about where to invest there. So actually, the recovery of the broader macro environment will benefit both our developed as well as our emerging markets looking ahead.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good evening. Congratulations, Irene, on the retirement, and thanks for everything over the many, many years. Two questions for me. First on the DSD. To be clear, did you guys say that the malware issues were what really prevented the DSD team from executing even better during the third quarter? Was that the correct takeaway to link those two issues together?","Brian Gladden","Yes, it really came down to our ability to serve and customer service and interoperations. And the results were somewhat challenged by the carryover impacts from malware. So yes, I think as I said, we're substantially past that. We're back to service levels that we would expect in the business and we're going at it now.","David Driscoll","Okay. And then just following up on this. If the DSD folks are in the store several times a week, have you seen shelf space gains maybe here in October? I know it's outside your quarter but have you seen shelf space gains in October versus what you were in say, July?","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes. I mean, as we were talking about, as we see our retailers resetting their shelves, we're picking up some shelf space as well as we're increasing our displays. And again, those are the actions that we think will help us as we look to the balance of the year in North America.","Brian Gladden","That should turn into share gains.","David Driscoll","Okay. Last question just on the earnings guidance. So double digits didn't change, but looks like your revenue comments is a little weaker. So then can you put some quantifications on these other things? always going to hate modeling at midnight on this company. So foreign exchange, interest expense. Is the basic message here, revenue is a little bit softer than you thought? Things are still pretty good, but basically everything's a little bit softer? Or are these other items, FX and interest expense, enough to offset any of this revenue change within the guidance?","Brian Gladden","David, all I would say is that the real driver of the revenue \u2013 the change in revenue outlook is the year-to-date impact of malware. So as we put all that together, it resulted in about $100 million of lost revenue for the year that we're not going to get back. And that's the pressure that causes us to adjust the top line outlook. Everything else is consistent with what we said and I would say consistent with the trends that we've delivered year-to-date.","Operator","And your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer","Thanks and congratulations. Best of luck, Irene. A question on Europe. You mentioned some promotional pushes in France and Russia, and those seem to be paying off or at least those targeted ones. And you mention the environment generally feeling better. Could you do your best to break down what is working better for you there? And perhaps tease out what is consumer versus the competition in your pipeline because obviously, you're seeing some spending work better for you than it has in years past. It's been a difficult market. And then what factors, out of all these, make this feel sustainable if you think this turn indeed feels that way.","Irene Rosenfeld","Yes. I would say, David, it's \u2013 we certainly did have a couple of tailwinds that made the quarter exceptionally strong in terms of a hot summer a year ago. And we did see a situation with the competitor in \u2013 early in the quarter, a recall of a competitor product that was helpful. But fundamentals are good. And we're seeing very strong category growth. We're seeing strong share, very strong vol\/mix. And we believe a lot of that is driven by programming. I alluded to the Premier League tie-in that we have in the UK. has been a sizable factor in driving our shares there. We've been very pleased with our strength in Germany. We've had a very strong performance there. Our chocobakery business is doing very well as we have repatriated the Burtons license in the UK. and across Europe. So there's a lot of actions that we are taking that are driving our strong performance that we would expect will continue.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi good evening and best wishes, Irene, in your retirement. I want to start \u2013 I just have two questions. First would be you quantified the effects from the malware incident on revenue. And I'm just curious how that's kind of flowed through the P&L. So what effect has that had on gross margin or operating margin? Could you give a little more color around that if you haven't done already? I may have missed that.","Brian Gladden","We didn't. It's had a minor impact on gross margins as we would have lost some volume leverage related to that. But you can assume it came out at roughly average gross margin rates and then maybe a little bit of volume leverage leakage. We also, as we've talked about and you'll see in the filings, have adjusted out the direct costs that relate to the incident, which year-to-date for the two quarters is now in the range of $50 million. But those are related to the incident in terms of improving our infrastructure and restoring and in some cases, manufacturing distribution logistics related to that.","Chris Growe","Okay. And just a follow-up question. As you think about the operating margin improvement that's occurring currently and you expect for next year, SG&A has been lower than I expected. And you've talked about overhead control, I think, across most of the divisions today, if not all. So I'm just trying to understand if there are other incremental restructuring activities that are taking place to achieve this operating margin expansion you expect both this year and next. Or is it just part of the natural kind of the benefit of previous activities that you've undertaken?","Brian Gladden","Well, we're still, Chris, in the middle of the restructuring program and that will continue through 2018. We've still got additional programs that we're funding as we speak and then are still executing to deliver. So it's still continuation of the same key programs with ZBB and shared services and all of those activities. So yes, we've still got more work to do there. We've still got funding to do that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Rob Moskow","Hi, thanks for the question and best wishes to you, Irene. I wanted to ask about China only growing low single digit. You did execute a relaunch of the product \u2013 of the Oreo product there. I was hoping for something a little better, considering a lot of other consumer staples companies have been reporting stronger growth. Is there an obstacle to getting back to high single-digit or double-digit growth in China?","Irene Rosenfeld","First of all, it's early days on our biscuit relaunch so we're encouraged by the early signs. And we are looking forward to continued performance there. Our chocolate was down a little bit year-over-year because we would have the benefit of the pipeline a year ago. So in aggregate, that was a bit of a headwind for us. Our gum continues to gain share. We're feeling very good about the performance there. So I think net-net, China continues to be a strong market \u2013 will be a strong market for us as we look ahead. And we are pleased to see the early signs of \u2013 that it's returning to growth, but again, there were a couple of variables in the quarter that dampened that overall performance.","Rob Moskow","Okay. And a quick follow-up for Brian. Brian, your tax rate guidance is pretty wide. The implications for fourth quarter are very wide. Do you think you can get us to closer to what you expect in fourth quarter and then maybe interest expense as well?","Brian Gladden","Yes. I mean, there's always puts and takes, Rob, I mean, there's always discrete items that are playing out. And you can see what our estimated tax rate for the total year is. It's in the range of 23%, 24%. So I \u2013 and that's probably the best I could do, given all the discrete items and the volatility around that. On interest, I think as we said coming into the year, we had a little bit of conservatism in that I think as you can see from the results, we're tracking a little bit below the guidance we gave you, which was $500 million. There are some other income items that were favorable and have impacted that. But the $500 million I would still say there's some conservatism at that number as you play to the fourth quarter.","Operator","And we do have time for one more question. And your final question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. First Congratulations, Irene. The value you've created for shareholder since you took over at Kraft has really been impressive so congrats for that. Two questions if I may, first on top line and then one on margins. First on top line, excluding some of the malware stuff, I think you implied if we look at the implication, the front half of the year was growing 30, 40 basis points. And underlying, you've accelerated to something closer to 230 basis points in the third quarter, which is very encouraging. But if I look at your market growth and your market share charts, it suggests the markets certainly ticked up but your shares ticked the wrong way. So it's hard to flip what we're seeing reported results in terms of the acceleration with what you guys are showing on the slide, so I was hoping you could help me bridge that gap.","Brian Gladden","Yes, so we set the category is growing in the range of 1.8% and reported year-to-date revenue growth is in the range of 80 \u2013 1.8% at snacking so that's not going to tie to total but that's just snacking and the categories snacking as well. So if you look at that, there's about 100 basis points difference. The largest piece is going to be malware. And as I said, that's 60 basis points year-to-date. And then you would have basically 40 basis points tied to year-over-year trade stock changes, and that's a combination of India, GST, Middle East destocking and we talked about. And then a bit of North America where we built some trade stocks last year and returned to more normalized levels this year so that explains the difference.","Jason English","It doesn't really explain acceleration now. So your categories ticked up. So we're categories ticked up if you just run the simple average, they ticked up from around 1.5 in the front half to 2.5 in the third quarter, simple average to get to the 1.8%. You accelerated, by far, greater margin with market share rolling the wrong way. So that's what I'm trying to foot, because if I look at category growth and market share, I would say this quarter shouldn't have looked any different than the front half of the year but clearly, it did, which is encouraging to see. I'm just trying to really understand the underlying component, so we can gauge durability of that turn.","Brian Gladden","Yes, I would just say, Jason, that we have seen categories pick up, I would agree with that. I think we've seen our business improve a bit better. A lot of that is a bit confusing because of the malware timing of first half versus second half. I think we've seen stabilization in North America that's improved. And our shares have not been dramatically different. If you look at the total year, we did, in U.S. Biscuits, mostly because of malware, turn to a losing share position, which impacts the metric that we're sharing with you, which is the holding and gaining share. So I think it's reconcilable. We're improving a bit faster than the market in the second half of the year.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations of Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir.","Shep Dunlap","Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors.","During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","In today's call, Dirk will give you an overview of our results as well as progress update against our strategic priorities. Then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We will close with Q&A.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon, everybody. Six months after the launch of our new strategy, I'm encouraged by our performance and the progress that we're making. Our new strategy leverages our unique differentiators. We are a global leader in snacking. We are not in general food. We have an expansive global presence with nearly 75% of our sales outside of North America.","We have large and powerful global brands and well-known local brands that resonate with consumers. And we've built a culture of cost discipline, which provides a strong platform to leverage future growth. And our teams are rallying behind are clear and focused strategy to accelerate growth and create value for our shareholders.","Our new strategic plan built on these fundamental advantages and it's focused on executing on these three strategies to create a more consumer-centric organization. The first strategy is about accelerating our topline growth, the second, about driving operational excellence, and the third, about creating a winning consumer focused culture. The combination of these three leaves us well positioned to create sustainable long-term shareholder value.","I am pleased with our latest financial results, which demonstrate clear progress against these strategies. These results reinforce my confidence in what we can achieve with a consumer-centric mindset and with our people in power to act with speed and agility. We started 2019 with a strong quarter.","In the first three months, we delivered against our key financial metrics. Our topline growth accelerated to 3.7% with a good balance of volume mix and pricing. Our emerging markets grew at 8% and we continue to build on our momentum created with our strong execution.","India, China, Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico and Africa all performed really well and Brazil returned back to growth. Our developed markets showed sustained growth at approximately 1%, supported by Europe and a continued improvement in North America.","We also expanded gross profit dollar growth of 4.5%, and we achieved OI increase of more than 4%. Now this enabled us to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth for the quarter. We also continue to improve cash generation with free cash flow of $200 million, while we deployed over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.","So let me share with you some more details and examples. Our first strategy which is consumer-focused growth is driven by deep and proprietary insights about snacking behaviors and occasions. The first focus area within the strategy is to extend our brands into broader snacking territories.","A couple of examples from Q1. We've talked about chocobakery, which is a growing gross category opportunity globally. And this quarter, in India, our team expanded our presence in this space with a new Oreo cookie which is dipped in our Cadbury Chocolate. The result is a premium offering, which helped us gain biscuit market share in this key market.","Another example is about parents wanting a playful child's treat. So we launched Cadbury Little Treasures in the UK, which is a portion controlled amount of chocolate, combined with a series of collectible toys. The launch was very strong, exceeding our expectations and helped us to increase overall Cadbury Dairy Milk sales in the UK.","The second focus area of our growth strategy is to make the most of our portfolio by investing in our global and our local brands. A great example here is specific biscuits, which is an iconic historical brand in China and absolutely loved by local consumers. It is also quite uniquely adapted to Chinese taste.","In this quarter we expanded the brand into rice wafers, a new segment beyond the core of the brand and it's performing really well. Our local brands in total contributed solid growth to this quarter which is an important reversal of the previous trend.","I also want to mention that our global brands grew faster as well at mid single-digits. We had strong growth across most global brands, but I want to call out Oreo, our biggest brand which grew double-digit, which is quite remarkable and also Cadbury Dairy Milk, another one of our big brands which grew high single-digit.","The third focus area of our consumer growth strategy is the activation of our new marketing playbook. This is driven by new and proprietary consumer insight. This is allowing us to refine our campaigns and capture more growth as consumers change how they engage with the brands they care about.","The first example here, is our new global Oreo campaign, where we used our insights to deliver highly effective local adaptations. In China for instance, we took the broad global concept of staying playful and made it culturally relevant, connecting Oreo with traditional Chinese occasions. As a result, we've grown China Oreo sales double-digit.","Another example is in Brazil where a new campaign for Trident called Chew2Relax made use of consumer insights to reposition the gum brand, driving a strong consumption recovery and help us regain share. The fourth focus area within our consumer growth strategy is about innovation, where we're changing to an agile innovation approach.","This focus is on testing ideas in small launches, capturing learning and then scaling them across more markets. An example here, which we are particularly proud of, is our first quarter launch of PataMilka in France, which went from idea to market in six months.","What we've done here is taking the Milka chocolate brand and expanding it into the broader snacking category of spreads, which is a big opportunity in a country where chocolate spread is a key part of afternoon snacking rituals. And we applied an agile reproach or approach, which had a record time from idea to market.","The last focus area within the growth strategy is reaching the consumer wherever they are, with points to a stronger expansion of our presence in alternative channels, but also geographical white spaces. A great example here is a continued expansion of our distribution in the traditional trade in Indonesia. This approach is helping drive double-digit sales growth in this promising developing market.","A second example was in our South Central Europe business. This area includes countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, but also Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Croatia. All these countries together add up to more than 50 million inhabitants. The team here expanded our presence in the impulse channel in a major way. Through investments in route-to-market and sales capabilities as well as A&C and price pack architecture. All this led to solid double-digit growth of the total business in the first quarter.","So now, switching to our second strategy, which is aimed at translating our consumer-centric growth model into incremental sales and margins, by focusing on improving execution across all elements of our business. This operational excellence strategy can come in the form of sales execution, for instance, where we leverage our customer supply and logistics capabilities to deliver outstanding in-store presence and availability.","As you know, a particular focus here is North America, where we are making important improvements to our supply chain, as well as leveraging the power of our direct-to-store distribution model. This has helped few results; including low single-digit consumption growth and feature and display conversion up double-digit, particularly behind the recent launch of the Game of Thrones themed to Oreo pack. This pack was displayed prominently ahead of the new season airing in the U.S.","We've also continued to benefit from our investments in our plants. We talked to you about Curitiba in Brazil at the CAGNY Conference. Another example would be our Suzhou plant in China, where our world-class efficiency has helped to drive strong volume growth in that market.","Turning to our last strategy, which is our drive to nurture a winning growth culture. The changes we are making have given our teams a renewed sense of energy, purpose and passion. This is helping them uncover more opportunities to grow. As I mentioned before, we have launched a nimbler more empowered business unit commercial organization with the right incentives to drive growth.","As a result, our commercial organization is better positioned to meet consumer needs, move fast and act entrepreneurially. We are also accelerating training across our business, focused on growth capabilities and growth mindset. And we're also launching more agile project based working systems across our different functions.","Under these newly empowered themes, we are already seeing benefits, like accelerated and more efficient investment in A&C and a better split of our investment in local and global brands, as well as higher sales and faster innovation.","Another initiative in the evolution of our culture is to drive step change innovation by creating an internal and an external network. The creation of our snack futures innovation and venture hub which aims to unlock snacking growth opportunities around the world is off to a great start. We have made minority investments in Uplift foods, which is focused on prebiotic functional snacks, and we also invested in a healthy snacking company called Hu, with a portfolio of vegan and paleo chocolate and biscuits.","Finally, I want to talk about our purpose, because our three strategies are inspired by our company purpose of empowering people to snack right. Snacking made right relates to many aspects of our business, but not in the least to the impact we have on the world. The journey to empower people to snack right starts with how we source our ingredients. And this is an important focus for me as the leader of this company.","I was fortunate recently to meet farmers and stakeholders we partner with in Ghana and Ivory Coast, as part of our Cocoa Life Sustainability Program. I witnessed firsthand how we are working everyday to strengthen the supply chain for the future and to empower farmers to achieve sustainable livelihoods.","I am proud to announce that we will accelerate our sustainable Cocoa Sourcing Program. So we commit that by 2025, 100% of the Cocoa we use in our chocolates globally will be sourced through our Cocoa Life Sustainability Program. That is an increase from 43% today. This is a huge milestone for our program, our team and our company. And also an important step toward further securing sustainable growth for Mondelez International.","So in summary, I feel very confident that we have the right strategies in place to capitalize on the opportunities we see in snacking and in our markets. Particularly with our strong emerging market position, and I'm also very pleased to see that we are executing against those strategies in a way that is bringing tangible improvement in our topline growth, our operational excellence and in our culture.","Our first quarter results demonstrate that we've got momentum as we head into this year of investment. Our categories are performing generally well in our brands both local and global are benefiting from increased investment in advertising, creative and innovation. All of this is very motivating for our teams in the markets. I think they feel empowered and trusted and ready to perform.","So let me now turn to Luca for more detail on our Q1 performance.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. It was a strong first quarter and start to the year, as we built on the progress we saw in the later part of 2018. In quarter one; we delivered strong organic net revenue growth, solid increase in gross profit dollars, double-digit earnings increase and positive free cash flow. We also returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders. Growth was broad-based as we posted positive results across each region and business unit, driven by another quarter of balanced volume and pricing.","It is important to note that the vast majority of Easter shipments happened in Q1, generally eliminating phasing impact between Q1 and Q2. Adjusted gross profit dollars on a constant currency basis grew more than revenue in Q1, similar to Q4, and we continue to make critical investments to our business, in order to support our long-term strategic initiatives, across brands, go-to-market and innovation, consistently with our plans for the full-year.","Organic net revenue increased 3.7% for the first quarter. This increase was driven by solid execution across our business and continued momentum in emerging markets, where we posted growth of 8% with a good balance of volume and pricing. Excluding Argentina, emerging markets grew 6.5%.","We delivered strong results across the Board, in India, China, Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico and Africa. In addition, Brazil returned to growth this past quarter. We also delivered solid performance in developed markets, supported by growth in Europe and continued steady improvement in the North American business.","On a regional basis, Europe once again demonstrated another quarter of solid execution as it delivered revenue growth of 2.7% lapping the strongest quarter last year. This growth was volume driven and broad-based with solid increases across chocolate, biscuits and candy. Russia grew double-digits, while Germany and the UK also delivered solid results.","AMEA grew 6.1% due to strength in several key markets and growth in every business unit. India once again delivered a quarter of double-digit growth powered by a strong market environment and great execution in both chocolate and biscuit.","China grew mid single-digit behind great results in both biscuits, as we grow both global and local brands and gum, where our stride proposition continues to gain traction with consumers. Southeast Asia posted mid single-digit growth with good results in biscuits and chocolate.","And Africa also grew with chocolate, candy, beverages and gum all posting growth. Latin America grew 8.4% due in part to Argentina. Growth excluding Argentina was low single-digit. Mexico delivered mid single-digit growth and Brazil returned to growth in Q1. As a result of trends in chocolate and solid results in biscuit. We are encouraged by the progress we made in Brazil and expect steady improvement throughout the year.","North America grew 0.5% in Q1 due to continued momentum in the U.S. Biscuit business, partially offset by gum and halls declines. We delivered biscuit share gains across nearly all channels, driven in part by strong performance and execution behind our Oreo brand. We made improvements in service levels in the quarter. That said, there is still work to be done to drive better consistency. We continue to expect progress in 2019, albeit not linear with overall modest growth for the year.","Now let's review our profit performance. In the first quarter, we grew adjusted gross profit dollars, nearly 5% on a constant currency basis. This increase was driven by continued productivity, volume leverage and pricing. Gross profit growth offset partially by additional SG&A, drove OI dollar expansion of more than 4% on a constant currency basis. This translated into adjusted OI margin of 16.7%, which is flat versus the previous year and consistent with our expectations.","During the quarter, we made some additional investments in A&C, route-to-market and Innovation, in line with our plan. In addition, we also lapped a favorability in indirect taxes matter for the previous year and incurred expenses related to the resolution of some legal and indirect tax matters.","On the regional basis, gross margin expansion and continued cost execution drove profit dollar improvements in three of our four regions. Europe grew adjusted OI dollars by 8% due to solid volume leverage. ","AMEA improved operating income dollars by nearly 17%, due to strong volume-based growth and productivity. Latin America OI dollars declined by approximately 19%, mostly due to the prior year impact of an indirect tax matter in Brazil.","Finally, North America, which increased adjusted OI dollars by nearly 9% on a constant currency basis, due to pricing, net of cost and improved service levels, which more than offset logistics inflation.","Let me spend a moment on category highlights. Our three snacking categories continue to demonstrate solid growth rates, growing on a year-to-date basis by almost 3%. This builds off the momentum of last year and reinforces our confidence that we are participating in an attractive space with the right geographical footprint.","Now moving to shares. Overall, we had or gained shares in 60% of our business. Our biscuits business grew 3.4%, approximately 80% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including our three most sizable businesses: U.S., China and France.","In chocolate, our business grew 5.9%, approximately 35% of our revenue grew or held share including Russia and Brazil. It is important to note that we over indexed in Easter versus many competitors. So we would expect share performance to improve next quarter.","Gum and Candy growth was down slightly, reflecting weaker results in the U.S., mostly due to Halls. About 30% of our revenue in this business gained or held share including strength in China gum and Mexico candy.","Now turning to earnings per share. Q1 EPS grew approximately 13% on a constant currency basis. This growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results as well as by share repurchases and low taxes rates.","I'll now move on to our free cash flow results. We delivered positive free cash flow for the quarter of $200 million, which was in line with our plans. We continue to execute well on our working capital metrics and net income conversion.","In terms of capital deployment, we returned $1 billion in capital to our shareholders in the first quarter. This included approximately 650 million in share repurchases at an average cost of $44.20 per share and $380 million in dividends.","Moving to the outlook. We are maintaining our organic net revenue growth target of 2% to 3%. We feel good about the quality of the topline results for Q1 and the growth across all the regions. Yet, while we are encouraged by the strong results, it is still early in the year.","We are also maintaining our view of adjusted earnings per share growth of 3% to 5%, although we delivered double-digit growth in the first quarter, we did get some benefit from a few items that were below the operating line, including tax and interest that are not expected to contribute in the same way in subsequent quarters.","We have also been clear that this is an important year of investments for brands, sales and innovation to drive more sustainable topline growth over the long-term.","With that, let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar","Good afternoon, everybody.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Andrew.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi. Maybe we'll just pick up on the organic growth piece. Obviously as you mentioned, it's just the first quarter, but I guess with the strong start to the year on the organic topline, maybe why is 2% to 3% still the right number for the full-year and particularly as pricing seems to be coming through nicely.","And as part of that were there any things that maybe were on discrete benefits that you can help quantify to organic growth in the first quarter, whether that's \u2013 you had mentioned a bit of a benefit, I think from Easter and perhaps anything related to like a Brexit inventory build and things of that nature?","Luca Zaramella","Yes. So I'll start by saying that we are clearly very pleased with the way Q1 played out, and it builds a little bit on the momentum we saw in the second half of 2018. I think it is also important to taking a look at the results to realize that those were really good quality results.","I think the teams around the world did a great job and I'll let Dirk talk maybe a little bit later, but this clearly adds to the conviction of the long-term potential of Mondelez and the merits of the strategy we put together and we presented to you.","We were very clear that in 2019, we really want to solidify the progress we saw toward the end of last year. And we believe we really need to see these growth rates above guidance for at least another quarter before we revise our outlook.","I want to remind you that this is an investment year and some of the investments we're making are for the benefit of the medium to long-term as well. So it will take a little bit of time for those investments to positively affect our revenue. And we clearly remain optimistic about our outlook, but as we've said many times, we want to be also thoughtful given some of the uncertainties that might post risk throughout the year, clearly Brexit is one of those. We also have some share losses and we need to address those in the remainder of the year.","To your specific question, at the time of guidance last quarter, we said that there would be a 50 basis points positive impact due to Easter in the second quarter because of timing. Realities after that guidance we sat down with the trade specifically in the UK and we decided that ahead of the potential Brexit exit that line, which was March 29, it was better for either one to put the Easter stock in the trade itself which we did.","So in terms of year-over-year, Easter happens to be neutral in terms of shipment on the quarter. So there is no timing effect. And so I think it is in relative terms, a clean quarter. Again, we're very pleased with the way we see the markets performing. But as I said, it is still early in the year to call up the guidance at this point.","Andrew Lazar","That's really helpful. Thank you for that color. And then just very quickly, Dirk, the better overall volume result even light of the pricing is notable. So I guess where are we in the process of the shifting mindset for more of a cost focus to a growth focus. And I guess how responsible is the new compensation scheme that rewards the volume growth component specifically? Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Thanks, Andrew. Yes, one of the key elements of our strategy was to create volume growth, which we haven't had for quite a while for a number of reasons. I think you are only growing as a company, if you're volume is going up, i.e. that you're selling more product to more consumers, but also because it gives us overheads leverage. We have installed capacity and to use that every extra ton we put through the plants comes at relatively speaking, lower cost than the previous one. So we try to help our teams to think differently about this.","First of all, there was the incentive plan, which we did a number of changes and not in the least, we started to reward our teams for volume growth. There's also a better balance between topline and bottom line growth in our incentives. We also push down incentives in the sense that before most people would be rewarded our region was performing, we now have people being rewarded at the business unit level. So it is more of a direct impact.","Before we used to have 60% of their results based on financial results, we've moved that up to 80%. So there is a more direct relation there and we also made sure that our long-term incentives are very performance based. So for sure that has played a role, a big role, I would say in these results.","The other one that is really helping in the sense is the fact that we are focusing more and more on dollar gross profit growth, and that makes you think a little bit different on how you generate that versus a percentage of gross profit. And so that means that volume also through that sort of thinking is being stimulated. So overall, yes, we are at close to 2%, 1.7% volume growth in the quarter. That's pretty good and we want to keep it like that because we can clearly see the benefit.","Andrew Lazar","Thanks everyone.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","And your next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe","Hi. Good afternoon.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Luca Zaramella","Hi.","Christopher Growe","Hi. I had a question for you, if I could start on pricing that was obviously quite strong in Latin America and you discussed the benefit from Argentina in the quarter. Just curious, does that continue across the year so that the continued kind of boost to your price realization for the overall company?","Luca Zaramella","Yes. Look, we are very pleased with pricing and the balance we see with volume mix. As I described pricing last year, we clearly focused on a couple of parts of the world, one was our developing markets, which Argentina is a component. I think there is a little bit higher pricing this quarter, than we saw on average last year. But the simple reality is Argentina in Q1 is lapping last year, a relatively benign inflation and ForEx. So the devaluation ramped up in the second part of the year. We moved to higher rates of inflation in the second part of the year in Q2 as well.","But the second one about Argentina is we are striking a better balance between pricing and volume, so the volume component is better than we have seen last year. So all in all, I think Argentina will continue growing at the rate that is not going to be necessarily the Q1 rate.","But excluding Argentina again, when I look at developing markets that grew 8.5% in the quarter, give or take, excluding Argentina, we are looking at a 6.5%, which is clearly building on the great momentum of last year, and the good news is that that growth rate is comprised both of volume for the vast majority and pricing. So we are very pleased.","The other one is North America, where last year we had positive pricing. As I said last year, we used pretty much all the pricing levers promo, price pack architecture and line pricing. We announced toward the end of last year, a price increase in the U.S. We are pleased with the way it is going into the market.","And again, when we look at biscuits, which is the biggest category we have in the U.S., and we look at consumption, nice numbers in terms of category growth between volume and pricing and importantly with share gains. So we will continue to see pricing for the remainder of the year. I think Argentina and the impact associated with it will come down in the quarters to come.","Christopher Growe","Okay. Thank you for that. I had just one other quick follow-up, basically as you put in place \u2013 a more of a focus on the local brands over the power brands, I just wanted to understand, and it sounds like Luca you had said maybe the level of investment this quarter was what you expected in relation to that strategy. Is that something that's taking effect right away? Is there a pipeline of new products that has to be developed? Is there a more marketing to be done there? Just wanted to understand how that manifest itself in this situation as you kind of transition your focus as well for some of the local brands?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. I'll take that one. Yes. So the first element there is that we are increasing our investments about $150 million this year that largely goes to A&C. And if I would split that between local and global brands that is more going to local brands than to global brands. We are also investing in route-to-market, India, Russia, China, South Central Europe. If we see there, there is more sales people, more trucks on the road, and we're also investing in R&D.","The R&D investment is probably taking a little bit more time, but increasing our A&C investment in our brands and giving a little push on our local brands that is really having an immediate effect, and also the route-to-market of course immediate effect. But we do still believe that the big benefit of that extra investment still has to show up, so we want to see an acceleration in the return we get on it.","And overall, I would also like to say that we don't see this as a one-off year where we do this. Our overall thinking is that as we invest more this year, we will get higher topline growth, which will lead to a solid gross profit growth and then we more or less flow half of that to the bottom line and reinvest half of that into our A&C and so on. So we see this continuing getting ourselves into a virtuous circle. And that would mean that every year we increase our investment.","Christopher Growe","Great. Thank you very much.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Your next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","I had a couple of questions related to the balance sheet, I guess. The first one, Luca it looks like total debt in the quarter was up sequentially by about $1 billion, and yet even interest expense came in more favorably. So I guess one question related to that is just, is there anything timing related that drove the debt higher in the quarter and then just I guess the disconnect between interest expense coming down, but debt going up?","Luca Zaramella","Look, I'll start by talking about the interest cost. I think on the interest cost Q1 at $80 million, it came quite frankly a little bit more favorable than we thought. The reality is we are still benefiting particularly year-over-year from additional net investment hedges that had a positive impact. We are quite pleased with the rates we have in terms of all the interest costs.","I would just want to remind you that we have $4.5 billion of euro denominated debt that is partly coming due in the second part of the year. That debt is at zero cost, actually negative cost for part of it, and we will renew that with a longer tenure, we will incur in additional interest cost. So yes, maybe the interest cost guidance of $450 million is a little bit on the conservative side. But I think again, we have to see how the year plays out. I think there has been a little bit of fluctuations around the interest rate.","On the debt, it is true the debt went up. I don't think it went up, I'm looking at net debt, so including cash that we have some additional cash compared to the end of the year. And the reason being that there is particularly in Q1 some seasonality due to Easter falling later, receivables went up a bit. So we have a little bit more liquidity in the system.","But the top of that went up pretty much because we renewed some debt. We have as you know, still relatively low cash flow compared to the yearly projection, so $200 million in Q1 versus the $2.8 billion that we are going to generate in the year. And then we took the opportunity to buyback shares as I said at $44 million. So between share and dividends, we paid a little bit north of $1 billion. So debt went up a bit. I think in terms of leverage, we are in the ballpark of the number we had at the end of last year. So I think it is pretty much timing.","Bryan Spillane","And so I guess, as we're thinking about the timing and relative as we're thinking about net debt for the full-year, absent something that we don't know about like an acquisition or someone along those lines. You're not expecting net debt to really increase for the year?","Luca Zaramella","Maybe it will increase a bit again in line with EBITDA, I would say, so but I wouldn't expect leverage to go up again. We are committed to the credit ratings we have. We just got reaffirmed as one of the agencies reiterated the rating. So we feel good where we are. I think you should project the same situation as of the end of last year.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Just one more related one. There has been some stories about the potential for Mondelez being interested in Arnott's and obviously I'm not passing a comment specifically about that, but just a deal that size seems large relative to what you described in M&A. So maybe either Dirk or Luca, if you could just remind us how you're thinking about M&A, both in terms of strategy, but more just size? How you're thinking about what types of size of deals you'd be looking at?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. As we have stated, our preference is for bolt-on acquisitions, looking at the different white spaces that we have around the world. As you go around that you look at biscuits, chocolates, or gum and candy markets, we still have areas where we are not present or not big enough and that will be our preference to sort of filling our geographical landscape.","We have the same in existing markets where in certain channels or there are certain areas in our categories like health and wellness premium, digital businesses that we would be interested in. But overall, we do not expect those to be big deals.","In the case of Arnott's, it's Australia, it's biscuits, it's quite sizable business. It fits in that white space thinking. It's obviously a process that's still ongoing. It's probably a little bit higher than what we would originally start when we thought about acquisitions. But at the same time, we have very clear expectations in the term of returns and in term of leverage, and we want to stay very disciplined buyers. So as long as it fits into the framework that we've set into our strategic plan, we will do so. But if it falls out of that we will not make a deal.","Bryan Spillane","All right. Thanks, everybody.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Bryan.","Operator","And your next question is from Steve Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula","Hi. Good afternoon.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Steve.","Steven Strycula","So two-part question. First for Luca. Just to on an apples-to-apples basis for first quarter, I know you have Argentina, Brexit, and Easter to Andew Lazar's question, would you say if we kind of take those three pieces into consideration, the underlying organic sales number was close to about a 3 percentage point number?","Luca Zaramella","Again, the way I commented on Brexit it was, we decided to put it Easter into the system ahead of a potential exit or even hard Brexit. So in terms of shipments, I wouldn't attribute to Brexit any impact year-over-year. It just happened that Easter this year fell in Q2, and we decided to put selling into the system in Q1. So, Q1 2018 versus 2019 no material changes.","I think as I said, Argentina is a little bit higher. We gave you the number between developing markets with or without Argentina. The relevance of Argentina in the quarter is a little bit higher than last year. We expect that to turn down. So I would say, look in shipment terms, I think it is really a clean quarter now. I think you saw the categories, particularly around chocolate, where we have some challenges, part of it is due to timing. We need to work on the shares.","And as I said, if you're trying to see if there are opportunities in terms of topline for the year, I would say, great start to the year. We are very pleased. As I said, I would like to see the second quarter above guidance for us to be able to call guidance out for the year.","Steven Strycula","Okay. And then a follow-up for Dirk. Dirk you recently did an interview with a German newspaper and admittedly my German isn't so fresh. So I was hoping you might help bridge a few comments or add some transparency as to what you meant when you were describing some of the opportunity set for a big global brands relative to home-grown brand, and then to wrap up, your comment on the monetization potential for the coffee assets in that paper. Thank you so much.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. Well, the two comments were not that new. I think the first one as it related to brands was that I have \u2013 and I think the rest of the management team in the company's shares that believes that the days of the big global brands that cover all areas and under which you can do everything and that will lead to significant growth, that's not necessarily what the future looks like. We can see the phenomenon very clearly with the insurgent brands in the U.S., which is translating in sales a little bit around the world.","So the comment was related to my opinion that we need to keep on growing our global brands. And as we explained, we are very happy to have our two biggest brands growing almost both of them double-digit is quite good. But at the same time, we believe local brands more and more will have a significant role to play. They are closer to the local consumers. They feel more connected to it and so the comment was meant to say, we believe our strategy is the right one.","On the coffee assets, the comment there was that they asked me, what was the future of our coffee assets in the business? I said that for the time being, we\u2019re very happy. We've got different investments. We're seeing good growth. We are happy what the management teams are doing there and they still have some good potential.","On the longer-term, the comment was that obviously we divested or partially divested our coffee business. We are not running it anymore. And over time, we will exit those assets. We don't know when, but clearly it's something that is in the plan. Those were the two comments.","Steven Strycula","Okay, thanks. I'll pass the line.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay.","Operator","And your next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi. Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Luca Zaramella","Hi Ken.","Kenneth Goldman","In North America, there was a fairly significant gap between your takeaway as reported by Nielsen in the quarter and your actual North American sales. I know you addressed this a little bit, but I'm just hoping for a little bit more color in your view what the biggest reasons were for maybe the reported numbers coming in a little bit more below takeaway then what some of us expected?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes, yes. And I don't know, which takeaway numbers that you are looking at, but you probably are comparing our biscuit takeaway numbers to our overall net revenue numbers...","Kenneth Goldman","No, I mean including everything. It's still a little bit lower.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. It's still a bit lower. I would say our takeaway overall would be around 2% and then the net revenue is 0.5%. Clearly biscuits are doing very well for us. We have a good category growth. We're increasing our market share, and we clearly see that in the consumption.","We do have as much smaller part of our business is related to gum and candy, and in the first quarter we saw a slowdown in those two categories, particularly in candy, we think that's only driven by Easter falling later into the year this year. We think that's going to come back in gum as been always a little bit under performing. So that's clearly a challenge as I bridge. They are not growing at the level that the rest of the consumption is growing.","Particularly hard hit was halls in the quarter, because of the cold-season not being very good and also that we have some more pressure from vicks competitive activity. The other factor that you need to take into account is that the retailers still are lowering their stock levels and that shows up in our net revenue, but doesn't show up in the consumption numbers. So that's clearly something that plays a role for us.","So those are largely the biggest factors, there is potentially also a little bit of non-measured channels that don't show up in the consumption numbers that you see, which we're not growing through the same rate. So that also causes that difference between the two. Those would be the big reasons, but we were able to perfectly make that bridge between our net revenue that we're seeing in consumption.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay. Thank you very much for that. That's helpful. My follow-up will be quick. In terms of the destocking you've seen which certainly isn't limited to Mondelez. Any idea when we can expect a little bit of a slowdown there? I mean, there can't be destocking forever, and yet it seems to be happening for longer than what maybe some companies were anticipating?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. So first of all, some of the rollouts were not the whole country at the same time. So that certainly plays a role. Then also the systems are now \u2013 so the rollouts were spread over more than one year.","The second effect that you have there is, it's an automatic system, and as that automatic system sees for instance our gum sales go down that will lead to lower stock levels de-referencing some of our SKUs, and so that sort of has an extra effect in the year, as our sales will start to go up. That will probably lead to a slight increase of our stock levels in the trade over time. So we do believe that this difference between our net revenue and the consumption we see will disappear in the coming months or quarters. And that it will be more reasoned out.","Kenneth Goldman","So, just to follow-up and make sure and I apologize for having the call little bit. But just to make sure I understand, if your takeaway numbers in Nielsen are disappointing in a certain category, the customers will automatically order less, I didn't \u2013 I knew that was something in there, but just want to make sure that that's what you're sort of suggesting?","Dirk Van de Put","They don't order unless they will \u2013 yes, in a way they do, but they will lower their stock level, because if the sales go down, they need to have less stock. So you see an effect from that to...","Luca Zaramella","What Dirk was saying, yes, is that in gums specifically, we see a little bit of trade reassessing their stock position and as consumption goes down in our SKUs. They adjust stock down. So it was just refining to gum for that comment, I assume.","Dirk Van de Put","Yes.","Kenneth Goldman","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English","Hey, good evening, folks. Thank you for the question.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Luca Zaramella","Hi Jason.","Jason English","I've got two questions. First a quick one, is your business going to be affected by the price controls implemented in Argentina? And if so what are the implications there?","Luca Zaramella","I think you know the answer to that question is, at this point, no. I think as the new relatively new President came into play, actually all price controls were removed. I think the exchange rate environment is in terms of ability to move money out of the country and to remit money at growth, as being better than in the past. So the simple answer is, no. We don't have price controlled categories at this point in time, but we don't know clearly what lies ahead.","Jason English","Got it. Thank you. And then my second question. I totally appreciate and respect your focus on gross profit dollar growth. But I'm still trying to make sure that I understand my margin bridges. And I was a bit surprised that we didn't see a bit more margin strength this quarter, given the sequential acceleration of pricing, given there is still pretty easy comp that you're cycling against here in the first quarter.","Can you walk us through some of the puts and takes that you're seeing there, whether in terms of inflation and productivity and maybe some mixed drags between gum weak or you pushing into local brands or investing et cetera?","Luca Zaramella","Yes. Look, I think it is clear that we are trying to move the mindset from gross margin percentages to gross profit dollars or from that matter from high percentages to high dollars. I think the gross profit line was in line with expectations and grew 4.5%, which is ahead of revenue we added 30 basis points of gross margin.","As I dissect the business on the gross margin line, quite frankly, we are very pleased with what we're seeing in three regions out of four. There is Latin America that is facing some pressure and last year we did over strategies for ForEx that were absolutely exceptional, and we are lapping quite positive ForEx rates in Latin America in Q1.","But with the exclusion of Latin America quite frankly, I see strength across all the other three regions and volume leverage is coming into play. Pricing, net of cost is positive and clearly we deliver productivity.","Below the line or below gross profit we invested in A&C, route-to-market in R&D as we've said. But and we also deliver cost savings in the operator line, so underlying savings both in gross profit and overheads is quite good in line with expectations.","We happened to lap a little bit of one-time as last year for some VAT related benefits that we got into the P&L. And as I said in my remarks, we are also \u2013 we have made accruals in Q1, in relation to some legal matters and again indirect taxes.","So the year-over-year impact is round about $40 million. So when I exclude these items, I think the P&L that we deliver in Q1 was great. On Latin America, I wouldn't be at this point overly concerned. We achieved what we have in plan and as Brazil specifically speaks out for the remainder of the year, we should be benefiting from better leverage as well there. So you might be a little bit below what you had in mind, but it is in line with what we had internally and importantly I see three regions on solid ground.","Jason English","Very good. Thank you. And congrats on the strong start.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","Hey, guys.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi.","Dara Mohsenian","I wanted to get a bit more detail on the pricing environment in Latin America, and in some of the key markets ex-Argentina, because it was a big sequential improvement in trend. So did Brazil and Mexico see some sequential improvement in Q1 versus Q4, and maybe just detail the competitive environment you're seeing there particularly in Brazil.","And then from a volume standpoint, we're still seeing declines in Latin America versus very healthy growth you're seeing in other emerging markets around the world and a lot of progress we've see in some of the other regions. So just curious on if we should get more of a balance between volume and pricing going forward in Latin America, and your ability to accelerate volume growth there like we've seen in some of the other regions? Thanks.","Luca Zaramella","Yes. Maybe I'll start with the volume part of the question and Dirk can give you a little bit of flavor around both Brazil and Mexico and what we're seeing. Yes, look, Latin America as historically shown negative volume. I think if you look at the volume mix this quarter it happens to be a little bit better than what you have seen in the last few years.","Remember that we used the full array of pricing tools to pricing the marketplace. So one component of volume is downsizing and there is an impact, specifically in Brazil around that. But all-in-all, I think you should expect also for the remainder of the year a little bit of volume pressure.","Having said that, I think there should be sequential improvement. In Argentina, as I said in one of the previous questions, volume came in better than last year. We are striking a much better balance between volume and pricing.","And I think this move to gross profit dollars and the opportunity we have to optimize reliable consistent and repeatable volume growth. I think it is quintessential to them all. So I think all-in-all, we are also pleased with the volume dynamics we are seeing overall in Latin America and hopefully we see an improvement in the remainder of the year.","On the Brazil, Mexico, Dirk if you want to...?","Dirk Van de Put","Yes. So, one observation on Latin America was that all our business units grew at the same time. In fact, all our business units around the world had growth. So that made the quarter quite appealing to it. To talk a little bit more about Brazil. We feel that Brazil is on an uptick. It's improving. It's not totally stable yet. There's certainly a number of macro uncertainties that are still there. But overall, we saw the business return back to growth, which we felt good about.","As we look at categories, the chocolate category was in slight decline, but that of course includes the impact of the late Easter. And in terms of our Q1 revenue, our chocolate grew high single-digits. One of the successes there was the launch of a product called Bis Xtra, under our Bis brand and there was a new type of wafers, covers with chocolate that's doing very well there.","As it relates to the gum category, we saw high single-digit revenue growth. This was driven also, sorry, the category was growing and our revenue was growing, largely driven by Trident and Trident launched a new campaign called Chew2Relax and that had a significant impact.","And then also powdered beverages is very important for us, and where we also see the category getting back to growth, which was not the case last year. There we lost a little bit of share. In the past year and we are starting to recover, but we still have some recovery to do.","So overall in Brazil, I would say surprising situation because that was the origin of your question is relatively healthy. It's not as big as it is in Argentina and largely in line with our expectations. By the way, the overall effect look of Argentina on our result, I think compared to last year's growth was 0.2. So there is an effect, but it's not that dramatic I would say, as you might expect.","And then maybe to talk about Mexico, a little bit. Mexico, we see a very good situation. We are growing mid single-digits and pricing is relatively mitigated there. Also so, I would say if you look at Latin America where the pricing is higher than it has been in the past years is largely in Argentina, the rest looks largely in line with expectations.","Dara Mohsenian","Great, thanks. It's very helpful.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard","Good evening, everyone.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, Alexia.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Hi there. So two quick ones. First of all, on the A&C spend. How much was it up this quarter and how much are you expecting it to be up to the full-year either in percentage terms or dollar terms? Is it going to accelerate from here or was there a big burst this quarter, and then it slows down?","And then my second question, just coming back to the beginning of the Q&A, you mentioned that one of the reasons that you didn't want to raise guidance for the full-year. It's early and there are clearly some risks on the horizon and Brexit is one of them. Is that the main one or there are other uncertainties out there that you're keeping an eye on? Thank you and I'll pass it on.","Luca Zaramella","Yes. Thank you for the question, Alexia. So on A&C, it was up in Q1. We're not going to start giving you details by A&C spending, but as particularly we look at working you can see which is dollars we spend behind initiatives online or Television, etc. That was up quite a bit year-over-year. I expect that increase to continue for the remainder of the year. And actually the overall A&C spending is going to sequentially increase in the quarters to come. Nothing that wasn't expected, it is baked into the guidance.","To your second question, yes, Brexit is clearly unknown at this point in time and it is the biggest risk that that we know of. But as I learned many times in my life, I mean sometimes the unexpected comes as well. And so there are a few elections around the world. I don't know the outcomes of those yet, but there might be some uncertainties.","Again, as I look at the categories, they are displaying solid growth in many places. We are fairly pleased with developing market. Having said that, given it is just one quarter. We decided to keep guidance the same.","Alexia Howard","Perfect. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you, Alexia.","Operator","And your last question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citi.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good evening.","Dirk Van de Put","Hi, David.","Luca Zaramella","Hi, David.","David Driscoll","I've got a couple of questions here that I wanted to ask. Just going back on Bryan's question about the debt, can you just go over how much of that euro debt has a negative interest rate? What is that negative interest rate? And when do you actually refi it? I'm still struggling with the $80 million interest expense in the quarter and how we get to this $450 million? And then you made the comment, well maybe that's a little bit conservative? Can you help me figure out how conservative?","Luca Zaramella","Look, just let's get the number straight on the debt. The net debt that we had at the end of last year was round about $17.3 billion. Okay. And it was the total leverage of 3.3x on EBITDA. At the end of Q1, net debt inclusive of cash, which I said increased around the world because of seasonality, specifically around Easter. It was $17.8 billion with the leverage round about 3.4x. So those are the numbers.","On the interest rate and the cost $80 million is clearly a number that if you multiply by four doesn't get you the guidance we gave on interest rate. Having said that, there is an impact on net investments hedges, and particularly year-over-year that impact is going to subside.","And then it was not uncommon particularly on short tenure debt to be able to borrow money in Europe at the negative interest cost. I'm not going to give you the details of what that these, but it is negative, so we are getting paid for that. And as we renew that debt at current rates, we are going to incur a cost and not last, we are going to increase tenure of the debt we are going issue for \u2013 in the second part of the year. So that is causing a little bit of \u2013 I mean such cost headwind that we have projected this year.","As I said, I believe we are going to be a little bit better than the $450 million, but I think again, it is still early in the year given some uncertainties. Remember we have multiple interest cost components in the year. We have short-term borrowings that we do around the world. There is the net investment hedges.","There is CP, commercial paper. The free cash flow came in better in Q1 than last year. So there is upside most likely. I think it is early for me to quantify it. I wouldn't expect to \u2013 a massive number here though in terms of upside.","David Driscoll","That's very helpful. On the phasing of the investments this year and I think it's around $150 million. Did the first quarter, more or less get its proportional share, did 25% of that $150 million go into Q1, then I'm really just trying to get a sense here for the pacing of these investments. Previously, I think you guys had said that you did expect it would be rather even throughout the year, but now that we've got one quarter in the book, so then you could update us on that one.","And then Dirk, I had one final one. You were about to bite on this one earlier in the questions. But I'd like you just to talk about that for key growth in the United States, the 6.5 points of volume growth that we're seeing in the Nielsen data and just the sustainability of that kind of take away and what's driving in. It's pretty special obviously it's in cookies and not in the other portions of the U.S. business. But I'm still just curious as to what's driving it in the sustainability of that cookie growth? Thank you.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Well, as it relates to the investments, it is evenly spread if anything, the first quarter was probably a bit lower than its fair share. So, it is not that we have an extraordinary spending in this quarter and now with tempers down, I would say we are expecting as Luca said the sequential increase of the spending as we go through the quarters.","As it relates to what we are seeing, yes, obviously that's not captured in our consumption numbers that you see. But you're referring to a report that I think came out recently. We do see quite some substantial increase of consumption. I would say there in biscuits in North America, that I think that's sort of a particular situation, we have Easter was in \u2013 is in those numbers. So that's going to have an effect. We also just ran a very successful promotion on Oreo, The Games of Thrones edition, which is a one-off.","So I'm expecting as those big effects sort of passes that consumption will go back to the normal 3%-ish that we're seeing. But yes, we clearly have seen in April, a big boost in consumption and we are quite happy about that.","David Driscoll","Congratulations and thank you, guys.","Dirk Van de Put","Thank you.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you.","Operator","And I'll now turn the call back over to Dirk.","Dirk Van de Put","Okay. Thank you. So as I said at the outset, I feel good about our performance in this first quarter and the progress we are making as the strategic plan. We are encouraged by this strong start, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments and keep on funding our future growth.","We want to continue to invest for the long-term to support our brands, our sales, on innovation and our quality. And we think we are entering into that virtuous circle that we're talking about to build this sustainable momentum and keep on creating value for our shareholders for many years to come. So thank you for the time. Thank you for your interest in the Company. And talk to you in about a quarter.","Luca Zaramella","Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"14823":["Mondelez International, Inc.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondel\u0113z management and the question-and-answer session.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z. Please go ahead, sir.","Shep Dunlap - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out two press releases and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com\/investors.","During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.","Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Shep, and good morning. By now, I'm sure you've seen our two press releases, and you're all Googling furiously. So before we discuss our second quarter results, let me take a few minutes to talk about my decision to retire and our plans for CEO succession. In 2006, when I became CEO of Kraft Foods, it was about to become an independent publicly-traded company.","We were a U.S.-centric conglomerate with a vast portfolio of undersupported brands in a wide variety of categories. Over the last decade, we took a number of bold actions to create today's Mondel\u0113z International, most notably the acquisition of Cadbury; the spin-off of our North American grocery business, which created the new Kraft; and the creation of the world's largest pure-play coffee company.","As a result, we're now the leading snacking company in the world with 85% of our net revenue coming from snacks, market-leading positions in each of our categories and more than 70% of our revenue coming from profitable Power Brands, a presence in over 165 countries and nearly 40% of our sales in faster-growing emerging markets.","Importantly, over that time, we enabled the creation of tremendous value for our shareholders, including over $120 billion through share price appreciation and dividends, and total shareholder returns that have significantly outperformed our peers.","It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve as Chairman and CEO of this great company. I truly enjoyed working alongside my colleagues around the world to achieve our bold ambitions and create value for our shareholders.","As I announce my retirement today, let me emphasize that I've never been more confident in our plans and in our momentum as I prepare to turn the reins over to my successor, Dirk Van de Put, currently President and CEO of McCain Foods. Over the past few years, our board has been engaged in a thorough multiyear succession planning process. This included a comprehensive global process that considered numerous highly talented internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased with the process that resulted in the choice of Dirk. We're confident that we found the right leader to steer our company to the next stage of our journey to sustainable growth.","Dirk is a truly global executive, a seasoned CEO, who's had deep experience in the food and beverage industry at leading CPG companies with presence in emerging and developed markets. He's lived and worked on three continents and has proven his ability to drive growth on both the top and bottom lines.","Under Dirk's leadership since 2011, McCain Foods has grown net sales by more than 50%, three quarters of which was organic, and EBITDA has grown double-digits for each of the past six years. Importantly, he achieved these strong results with a values-based leadership style and a steadfast focus on people.","We look forward to his bringing this experience and a fresh set of eyes to build on our margin progress and accelerate our growth. I have no doubt that Dirk together with our strong leadership team will continue to achieve even greater success in the years ahead. And of course, I'll be cheering loudly from the sidelines as a sizable shareholder.","Dirk will become CEO effective in November, and I look forward to continuing to serve as Chairman of our board until the end of the first quarter next year to ensure a smooth transition.","With that context, let me thank all of you for your support and commitment to our company over these many years. Brian and I look forward to introducing you to Dirk as he comes on board.","So now, let's talk about our second quarter. It's difficult to discuss our Q2 results without first saying a few words about the malware incident of June 27. Despite tremendous efforts by our teams to continue to operate the business, manufacture our products and serve customer needs, given the timing of the attack, we experienced meaningful disruption in our ability to ship and invoice during the last four days of the quarter.","As a result, our Q2 organic net revenue growth was negatively affected by approximately 2.4 percentage points, slightly less than what we estimated in our July 6 press release. While we're not yet back to normal, we expect to recover the majority of these delayed shipments in the third quarter. Brian will discuss this in more detail in a few minutes.","Despite this unfortunate incident, our underlying performance in Q2 was largely in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of the malware incident and the India Goods and Services Tax, organic net revenue would have been roughly flat, and three of our four regions performed well.","On the bottom line, despite the impact of the malware incident, we continued to deliver strong adjusted operating income margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth at constant currency. What's more, we feel especially good about our strong and growing cash flow, which enables us to fully fund our growth initiatives and deliver compelling capital returns.","In the second quarter, we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we announced today that our board has increased the quarterly dividend by 16%, reflecting the strength of our business and our improving free cash flow.","Going forward, we're now planning to grow our dividend in excess of adjusted EPS growth. While Brian will provide details on our performance by region, I'd like to say a few words about North America, which continued to be challenged.","As we discussed last quarter, we're actively working to improve the trajectory of our U.S. business, and the team is executing with a sense of urgency. While the Q2 numbers were soft, we are seeing some green shoots which give us confidence that we'll see improvement in the back half.","In particular, we're optimistic about our robust pipeline of well-being innovation and core brand renovation, our white space chocolate expansion and gains in displays and shelf space as we capitalize on our competitor's transition out of its DSD network. So in summary, our underlying performance in the first half came in largely as expected, and we continue to expect improved top line growth as we progress through the second half. As a result, we've maintained our full year outlook.","Let me now turn it over to Brian to discuss our Q2 performance in more detail.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Before I get into the quarter, let me provide more details on the malware incident and where we currently stand in our recovery.","On June 27, like many other companies, we were globally impacted by an unprecedented malware incident. For the last four days of the quarter and into the third quarter, we had limited ability to ship and invoice customers in many markets. Thankfully, our teams managed to keep many of our manufacturing facilities running, which was a critical accomplishment. We executed our business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact of the incident and minimize business disruption with a focus on consumers and customers.","Over the past four weeks, we've worked tirelessly to restore our systems and recover from the disruption. Although we've now restored the majority of our affected systems, in a few cases, parts of our supply chain have still not fully recovered, and we anticipate some impacts in our third quarter. We'll also incur some additional one-time costs related to the incident during the second half.","In terms of our results, the malware incident had a negative impact of approximately 240 basis points to organic net revenue, or about $140 million. We expect to recover a majority of the delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter, and we've made good progress in shipping these orders during the month of July.","We did, however, permanently lose some revenue due to shorter supply chains, mispromotions and lost consumption in some markets. That said, we do not believe the incident has had any long-term impact to our customer relationships or market share. We're pleased with our execution during this crisis and believe that our business continuity plans were effective in minimizing the impact to our customers and to our ongoing financial results. As you can imagine, we are conducting a comprehensive review of the incident to determine any potential opportunities to further improve the security of our global systems environment.","Currently, we do not expect the required investments to be material to our results. This event has underscored the resiliency of our team and their ability to pull together in the face of adversity. I'd like to thank our teams for their tireless efforts to put us back on track and ensure that we're focused most importantly on our customers and consumers.","As Irene stated, our second quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, absent the malware incident and the transition impact of the India GST, which were a combined headwind of 260 basis points to our top line growth.","Excluding these items, our organic net revenue growth would have been essentially flat. The impact of these incidents masked solid results in a number of areas. For instance, our global e-commerce net revenues continued to grow strongly, up 30%.","In Europe, we executed well overall and especially in our chocolate business. And several of our emerging markets are stabilizing and have an improving macro outlook. We're delivering solid results in countries such as India, Vietnam and Mexico, where market fundamentals are improving, and our momentum is strong.","Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance. Q2 marked another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion as we continued to aggressively reduce cost. Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 90 basis points. Our progress was driven by improved SG&A as we continued to execute our Zero-Based Budgeting program, which delivered cost reductions in both overheads and advertising spend. We expect our advertising and consumer promotion spending will be about flat for the total year as we move some spending to the second half.","Adjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points as continued solid net productivity and better pricing were offset by unfavorable mix and higher input costs, especially in dairy. We continue to see gross margin improvements as a key enabler to delivering our 2018 margin expansion commitments.","For the first half, adjusted OI margin was 16.3%, and we remain on track to deliver our mid-16% outlook for the year. I do want to note that we decided to adjust out the incremental costs associated with the malware incident in the quarter, representing about $7 million. As I said, we will incur additional one-time costs in the second half as well but do not expect them to be material at this point.","Let me now turn to our regional performance. We continue to see solid trends underlying the results in three of our four regions. Europe posted another strong quarter of margin expansion with an increase in adjusted OI margin of 220 basis points to 19%. Strong net productivity, lower A&C costs and continued overhead reductions drove the improvement. Organic net revenue declined 0.7%, including a negative impact of 220 basis points due to the malware incident. Despite this impact, Europe delivered solid vol\/mix growth in both chocolate and biscuits, and our chocolate business performance was led by Germany and Russia.","Our Europe business continues to demonstrate solid operating performance, and we remain encouraged by additional growth opportunities, including in chocolate bakery and chocolate seasonals.","In our large and diverse EMEA region, we continue to navigate through a mixed environment. Our Asia Pacific business delivered solid results while some of our markets in the Middle East continue to be challenged.","Adjusted OI margin increased 230 basis points to 15.6%, driven primarily by lower A&C spend, continued overhead management and a property insurance recovery. In markets like the Middle East, we've selectively trimmed A&C spending where returns have been challenged.","Organic revenue declined 0.7%, including a negative impact of 90 basis points from the transition impact of the India GST and the malware incident. Despite those impacts, we delivered strong results in India and Southeast Asia.","Our India business grew mid-single digits despite the impact from GST. Excluding this headwind, growth would have been double-digit. Chocolate continued to be strong as we executed our plans, and the overall market conditions remained good.","China posted a small decline, driven primarily by soft category trends. Our gum business continued to grow and take share, and Milka chocolate performed in line with our expectations. We expect our biscuit business trajectory to improve as we relaunched Oreo this summer with both improved packaging and a new product formula.","Difficult economic conditions in the Middle East continue to pressure category growth, but our year-over-year comparisons are easier in the second half. In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 530 basis points to 14.3%, primarily driven by improved overhead costs and lower A&C spend, as we continue to adjust our spending levels to match the market dynamics in countries like Brazil and Argentina.","Organic net revenue declined 0.5%, including a negative impact of 280 basis points from the malware incident. Mexico delivered solid growth, driven by strength in candy while Argentina implemented pricing to offset currency-driven inflation.","Brazil remains challenging due to continued economic weakness. Our chocolate business delivered a third consecutive quarter of growth and solid share performance, while our biscuits business continued to face difficult price gaps and consumer down trading.","Consistent with our discussion during our first quarter call, our North America results were challenged in Q2 as overall category growth was even lower than our tempered expectations. Adjusted OI margin declined 250 basis points to 19.2%, driven primarily by benefits in the prior year related to an asset sale.","It's important to note that of all of our regions, the North America region was most impacted by the malware incident, driven by the lower trade stock levels associated with DSD. As we've said, this is also the market where we had the majority of our lost consumption due to the July 4 holiday timing.","Organic net revenue declined 8%, including a negative impact of 410 basis points from the malware incident. These results were driven by U.S. biscuits, as well as declines in gum. As Irene mentioned, we're moving with a sense of urgency to address the issues we've identified and feel confident this business will return to growth. We continue to expect to see improved results in the back half of the year.","We have a strong second half innovation agenda in North America. This includes our new V\u00e9a snacks and non-GMO Triscuit crackers, both of which launched in July as well as belVita Protein, RITZ Crisp & Thins and GOOD THiNS, which continue to gain share. Our white space Oreo Milka chocolate candy is also gaining momentum with healthy velocity and stronger peak rates as we expand distribution and capacity.","In addition, our DSD-driven share gain plans are now beginning to play out as we'd expected. As our competitor began to transition out of its DSD system at the end of Q2 and our major customers reset their shelves, we're now capitalizing by gaining displays and share of shelf. We expect this to be a key growth driver in the second half and into next year.","Now, let me spend a few moments providing some highlights by category. Snacking category growth was 1.5%, which was generally in line with our full year expectation. We're pleased that our shares have stabilized and were roughly flat for the first half. You should note that these revenue growth numbers include the negative impact of the malware incident.","Our biscuits business posted a revenue decline as solid performance in the UK, Japan and Germany was offset by weakness in the U.S. Approximately 80% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share. In chocolate, our business grew 5%, driven by solid results in Germany, India and Brazil. We continue to see good momentum in U.S. chocolate, which is now benefiting from increased capacity coming out in the second half, as well as Milka in China, which continued to perform well. Approximately 60% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category.","Gum and candy declined approximately 7% as the gum category continued to experience significant weakness, especially in the U.S. We're planning for continued category declines while working on initiatives to stabilize share and shift focus to our strong, growing and highly profitable candy and mint platforms. About 45% of our year-to-date revenue in gum and candy gained or held share.","Turning to earnings per share, in Q2, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.48, up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by our strong operating income growth. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the full year. As you think about your models, let me remind you that our results now exclude the impact of our French confectionery and Australian cheese and grocery business divestitures that closed in April and early July, respectively. These items were detailed in an 8-K we issued last week. These businesses account for approximately $530 million in revenue and $0.06 of EPS on an annual basis. The divestitures improve our growth rates while we're moving quickly to remove stranded costs associated with these actions. In Q2, we returned approximately $900 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","As we receive cash for our two recent divestitures, we're increasing our full year expectation for share repurchases to between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. In addition, we raised our quarterly dividend by 16% and are now targeting to grow our dividend faster than adjusted EPS as our improving free cash flow generation enables us to continue to fully fund our critical growth and transformation investments while also deploying more capital to shareholders.","Now to our outlook. Overall, our outlook is unchanged for the full year. Our organic net revenue growth target remains at least 1%. We expect adjusted OI margin in the mid-16% range as well as double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. As you think about your models for the next two quarters, remember that Q4 is seasonally a higher revenue quarter and will be higher than Q3 even after the impact of the additional malware incident related shipments. You'll note that we're absorbing the dilution from the two divestitures, but we're also adjusting our outlook for interest expense for the year, and the two items roughly offset one another.","And with respect to free cash flow, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2 billion for the year as we see lower CapEx, improved margins and good working capital efficiency.","With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a few closing comments before we take your questions.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Brian. Throughout my tenure as CEO, the world and our industry have undergone unprecedented change. During that time, we anticipated the emerging challenges, adapted accordingly, and in the process, created significant value for our shareholders.","I'm proud to leave this company far stronger than the one I started with. I'm indebted to my 90,000 colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly to deliver their commitments each and every day in the face of many challenges. Looking ahead, I'm confident that our long-term value-creation strategy continues to position us to win and that the future for our great company is, indeed, very bright.","With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations to you, Irene.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thanks, Bryan.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, my question is just related back to the North American biscuit category. I guess everything you see is that snacking in general is still growing, yet the category is sort of lagging snacking growth in North America. So Irene, can you sort of just give us some more color in terms of where you think the category is missing? Is it not channel diverse enough? Is it losing share to other snack options? Just trying to understand really why the category seems to be lagging overall snacking in North America.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. Bryan, we talked about this at CAGNY. And frankly, we've been looking at this for quite some time. I think it starts with the fact that we're seeing price deflation and erosion in promotion effectiveness in a number of markets but particularly acute in the U.S. And I think you probably have heard that from many of our competitors.","In response to that, we are progressing our revenue management activities to continue to find those places that we're getting the best return, to work with our customers to understand the ROI of some of the various promotional practices that are going on. And frankly, I do believe that U.S. food deflation will begin to stabilize later this year.","The second one is that we are seeing continued shifts toward health and well-being products. And again, as we've talked on a number of occasions, we're taking significant steps, both in terms of renovating existing brands with things like organic Triscuits, belVita Protein, RITZ Crisp & Thins as well as totally new products like V\u00e9a, which we just are in the process of introducing into the marketplace. And we believe that will help to not only improve our share position, and it's a big part of our back half share recovery, but we also think it will ultimately stimulate category growth.","And then lastly, there is a piece that is non-measured channels. Again, primarily e-commerce, which in snacks is a fairly small piece of the business, but it's also natural food stores and other places where the consumer is shopping and once again, it's one of the reasons we have chosen to focus our efforts so much as we complete our supply chain reinvention on having the flexibility to introduce different package formats and different package sizes so that we can be present in whatever channels the consumer is shopping.","So net-net, we are seeing continued category declines. And in fact, as Brian said, it got a little bit worse in the second quarter, but we have great confidence as we look to the back half of the year, particularly a number of the actions that we're taking that will start to see that category recover.","Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Irene, congratulations as well from me on your decision.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Thank you.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Two quick questions. First just the first one around Dirk, I know he doesn't start till November. Mondel\u0113z, obviously, has a 2018 margin target. You've got an expectation that margins can further improve in the years thereafter.","I'm sure any new CEO candidate is going to do their due diligence around the certain targets that are out there, whether they be revenue or margin oriented. But I mean, could we have confidence, I guess, that Dirk is sort of fully bought in, if you will, and supportive of the kind of margin targets that are already out there? Or do you think there's still a need for a new CEO to come in and do his or her own sort of more in-depth analysis in the seat, and that those things are all potentially subject to change? And then I've just got a follow-up.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Well, I think there's no question. It's too early to speculate on what Dirk might do as he gets fully on board. But what I will say is, he's very familiar certainly from having done his own due diligence about what this company's progress has looked like, and what our aspirations are. And quite frankly, as I said, one of the reasons that we selected him as our leader is the fact that he has a very proven track record of being ambidextrous, as I call it, walking and chewing gum, top line and bottom line, and it's actually quite an impressive set of results.","So he's a seasoned CEO. He knows well the challenges that one needs to make on the top line and the bottom line. And again, he's got a proven track record in that area. So, I have great confidence that he will come in here. Obviously, he wants to learn and form his own opinions, but I feel quite comfortable with the targets that are laid out.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, just to follow back up on North America biscuit, obviously the competitor DSD transition is one of the things that you pointed out that will help improve biscuit trends in the back half of the year. And you mentioned some incremental display and shelf gains.","Now that we're a little further into this process, I was wondering if there were any maybe more specific metrics you could share along those lines. Because I guess when it was initially announced, Mondel\u0113z was certainly pretty excited about the potential opportunity. And maybe it's just me, but it seems like more recently, some of the commentary from the company has been a little more along the lines of, well, we'll see if we get a benefit. If not, we can always rethink things, too. And I'm just trying to think maybe it's more the way I'm reading into it than it is reality. But any color you can share around some of the metrics about the type of gains maybe you'd expect might be helpful there?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Andrew, we feel every bit as confident and optimistic about the opportunity that our competitor's exit presents us with. For competitive reasons, we've been reticent to get into a lot of the specifics, but I will tell you we are seeing early success, and part of the challenge is we've been talking about this for quite some time. They announced six months to nine months ago, and we told you what we were going to do, and now we're actually about doing it. So, we have every confidence that we will pick up incremental shelf space, incremental displays, and it will be a key contributor to the trajectory change on our North American business in the back half of the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","And I think, Andrew, as you look at some of the July data, it will be a little messy because of some of the malware shipment timing issues. But again, at the individual retail or account level, we feel very good about the progress.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","I guess the other point is, Andrew, it is an expensive capability, and so we want to be clear with our shareholders that we will be prudent as we continue to leverage this asset to make sure that it's giving us a good return. So that's the context in which you might have heard us refer to that.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel Capital.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, good morning.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I wish you well, Irene, in your retirement as well. In relation to revenue growth, as I think about the organic revenue growth, the improvement required in the second half of the year, I guess, I wanted to understand where you're seeing some strength in the business? I heard you, Brian, mention some better emerging market performances kind of shaping up there. I'm just trying to understand where you're seeing that improvement that will help us get a better feel for the second half improvement in revenue growth?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. Look, you're talking globally?","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Globally, and I realize that the malware incident, you have some benefit in Q3. I get that. I was thinking more about the underlying business, if you will, and how it's improving.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, look, there's no question as we think about the second half. So you can do the math on what we need to do in the second half to get to at least one. That's still \u2013 we need a good second half. The malware incident has created a headwind, and I would say it does make that target a little bit tougher as we talked a little bit about some of the third quarter challenges. But I'll give you a few reasons to believe that we feel good about the second half.","Three of our four regions are actually executing well and don't really need a significant change in trajectory as we look at the second half. The second thing is we will ship through the majority of the Q2 malware shipments. And again, July, we did the majority of that and feel good about that. We also, as Irene talked a bit about North America, we have good confidence in North America having a much better second half, and it's about the DSD opportunity. It's about the pipeline of health and wellness opportunities that we're pursuing, and it's about the execution of the team as we've had leadership in place there. So, those are really the drivers that I think we feel good about it.","There's the V\u00e9a, the Triscuit and the share gains that we'll have, and we think that will also help the category growth in North America. And then in general, I think as you look at the second half, we have easier compares. You got India demonetization. You've got some of the weakness we saw and trade stock dynamics playing out of the Middle East that I think will help us in the second half as we look at compares. So look I think we feel pretty good about the opportunity to have a much better second half, and those are the real drivers.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I just had one quick follow-up question for you. I did hear a number of divisions where A&C spending was down. In some cases, it was you're kind of rightsizing to the opportunity in a given market like in Latin America. Is that the trend then we should expect or as you think about reinvestment back in the business, maybe not so much just all A&C, but how is that A&C trending in the second half of the year?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, look. I think we expect \u2013 it was around 9% for the first half, which is slightly down from where we were in the first half of last year, but roughly in the range of where we've been as we look at the last six quarters or so. For the full year, I would say we'll be approximately flat. So, we will have a little bit of timing and more A&C spending in the second half. We continue to distort that spending, obviously, to Power Brands and to markets where we're seeing the growth opportunity, and therefore, we've taken it out of some. Digital mix continues to be a priority. We're projected to be at 30% of our spend on digital. We still think that makes lots of sense. And again, as I said, given the innovation initiatives that we have in the back half, that will drive some of the spending that we have lined up for the second half.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","You got it, Chris.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, and Irene, best wishes to you from me as well.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Irene, it's a little backward looking of a question, and you highlighted many of your accomplishments over the years, and clearly, you've helped create a lot of value for shareholders. But everyone has decisions we wish we could change. I always find it interesting to sort of ask outgoing leaders. As you look back on your career running Kraft and Mondel\u0113z, are there any choices that stand out that you made that maybe with 20\/20 hindsight you would have done slightly differently? I always find that informational.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. No, I think it's a great question. Actually as I have had a chance to reflect on the last decade or so, I'm quite proud of a number of the things that happened. I think the portfolio decisions probably are kind of at the top of the list. I'm proud of the pivot that we made in response as we launched the company, the pivot that we made to more aggressively go after cost and improve margins.","And I think in hindsight, I think perhaps we could have gone after the costs a little faster that would have helped us to be able to have the fuel to invest in our growth a little bit sooner. But I actually think that one of the things that I'm most proud of is having been able to balance the long-term and the short-term and the flexibility to pivot as we did in 2013, 2014 as we jump-started ZBB and supply chain reinvention and our Mondel\u0113z Business Services to allow us to deliver the margin expansion. So, I think my regret is that we haven't fully realized the potential on the top-line, and I have every confidence again as I hand the reins over to Dirk and we look at his track record that, that is the last piece of the puzzle here.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And then a quick follow-up for me. Can you talk about the board's decision? I know you mentioned what Dirk's qualifications are, and certainly, he's had a good bit of success at McCain, but can you talk about the board's decision to go outside the firm to identify the next CEO? Typically, there are internal candidates at the senior level who are interested in these kind of jobs. So how do you think about that? And frankly, how is the team and the board managing the morale of the top internal candidates who maybe, to be frank, are slightly disappointed right now?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. Over the last couple of years as I talked with the board about my plans and my timeline for retirement, they put in place, as you would expect, a very thorough multiyear process. And in that process, the board considered both internal and external candidates, and there was a very talented pool of both internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased with the choice of Dirk and for all the reasons that we've laid out, and I feel quite confident that he will work hand in glove with our senior leaders to deliver on the commitments that we've made.","Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, everyone.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Wishing you all the very best for the next chapter, Irene. Thank you. Can I ask about the gross margin outlook? It feels as though the gross margin progression has been pretty flat recently, I guess, certainly this quarter. The commodity outlook, I mean, dairy's obviously a problem at the moment. Will you get some relief at some point perhaps on the cocoa side?","And then can you talk specifically about the pricing environment? Particularly here in North America, we're hearing that a lot of the retailers are getting pretty aggressive on pricing, pushing private label. I know that's not a huge issue in confectionery, but it may be in cookies and crackers. So maybe just a few comments on the gross margin outlook, and I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Sure, Alexia. Yeah, I mean, gross margins were down slightly in the quarter, and that's sort of the trend we've had over the last few quarters. The net productivity, the supply chain reinvention work is executing well. We're delivering strong net productivity. So that's not the challenge.","I would say, clearly, we lost some volume leverage in the quarter as it related to the malware issue, and the pricing dynamic, pricing in general was positive, and the reality is most of that was driven by some of the inflationary economies like Argentina and Egypt, Nigeria. Those are big, big drivers where we had significant pricing.","There's a couple of places where we have seen trade spending and incremental pricing challenges. You call out the U.S. I would just say in the U.S., that pricing has been more or less tied to some of the DSD opportunities as we position to gain some market share and take shelf space. Obviously, that's part of the equation and just something that we had expected to do. So we've been appropriately investing there.","So again, I would just close by saying I think gross margins will continue to be a key element as we look at the margin expansion. And again, we have a full portfolio of programs we're driving around productivity that we expect will deliver over the next multiple quarters here.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And the commodity outlook, does it get better in 2018?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. Clearly, we've seen cocoa drop, but as you know, it's more than cocoa in the portfolio. Dairy has been a challenge. Even cocoa butter has been a challenge, wheat and sugar. There're some other things moving the other way. Right now, in the first half of the year, commodities were a pressure, and they were a pressure versus what we even had in our plans.","As we go to the second half, not significant changes, as we're mostly hedged for a lot of those commodities, and dairy, as I think you know, there's not a lot of liquidity, and you can't really hedge that exposure. So as you head into 2018, based on what we see right now, there's a bit of relief. But obviously, you have to work through the pricing dynamics, and it's a complex equation.","Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, folks. Congratulations, Irene, for your pending retirement. I hope you have ample time to enjoy it in the years ahead. I guess I want to come back to the top line growth and what you're highlighting for category growth. You're footnoting a lot of brick-and-mortar data with Nielsen, which I think we all know is sort of imperfect. If we marry it with Euromonitor data and try to replicate your analysis, it yields a different conclusion, that your end markets are growing something closer to a bit north of 4%, which is slower than historical context, but a lot better than the bit north of 2% that you reported last year.","I mean, there's flaws in both data sets. But as you contemplate what's not captured in Nielsen, do you think Euromonitor may be a more accurate prediction? Or structurally, do you really think your categories are slowing so much so rapidly? And what does it mean for the long term?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","So Jason, I think the growth is closer to 2% than it is to 4%. I'm not quite sure how you've put those numbers together. And it is slower than certainly than the rates that we would have seen a number of years ago. But I think we've set our expectations properly. I think we've got a good sense of category growth. We've been focused disproportionately on our share growth. I'm delighted to see our shares stabilizing as we come out of the second quarter. And we are very focused on our pipeline of innovation and renovation to help to continue to drive our overall share performance. So I think in the foreseeable future, we're probably looking at category trends in the approximately 2% range, and I think we have a real opportunity to drive our share performance within those categories.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","But we are, as we've talked about, disproportionately moving investments and building route-to-market capability and distribution around channels that are growing faster. So acknowledging that there are some unmeasured channels that clearly may provide more growth is something we've done and clearly, putting some investment there is part of our strategy.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sure, sure. But it sounds like thinking about the path to eventual reacceleration, it's a path to 2% now, not a path to north of 4%. I mean, tell me if you disagree with that. And then secondly, I'm looking at the same chart you showed in the first quarter. First quarter category growth down 2.5%, this quarter up 1.5% on a year-to-date basis, suggesting that this quarter actually had a pretty dramatic snap back in category growth.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","If you recall, Jason, the issue in the first quarter was the timing of Easter, so...","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Consumption for Easter was \u2013 yeah.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Year-to-date, we're approximately at about 1.5%. So that smooths out the impact of Easter.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","We said (45:59) in the first quarter was somewhere closer to 1%. So it's 1% to 1.5% is about what we're seeing pretty consistently.","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","But, let me bring this back. We continue to feel very strongly with snacking categories, we'll grow faster than the rest of food that we will grow faster than center of the store categories because we are more impulse driven. We've got good demographic trends as a tailwind as we think about the fact that people are traveling farther to work, more women in the workforce, et cetera, which is causing people to snack more often.","And so the combination of all of those factors together should give us a nice tailwind, particularly the emerging market is really the key to getting the aggregate category growth closer to the levels that you're talking about is really to see the emerging markets come back, and slowly but surely. We're starting to see that, in markets like Brazil, for example, they're still well below historical rates.","So as we see the emerging markets come back, our strong footprint in those markets, our strong brand positions, together with the actions that we're taking should allow us to disproportionately continue to grow our share and the categories in the face of the broader macro trends.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, thanks for the question. And best wishes, Irene. Hey, Brian, I think when we met a couple of months ago, you said that you had a whole war room set up to try to plot a strategy for the second half for Nabisco and DSD, but I was hoping you could give us some numbers on any kind of distribution gains that you've achieved? You mentioned it qualitatively. But is there anything you can help us with when we watch the Nielsen data come through as to what kind of ACV to expect or just roughly how many customers you've made gains with?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Rob, it's still just a little bit early. I hope you can sense our optimism and positive energy around it. I think, clearly, we're in the middle of shelf resets now, and you'll start to see that play out as you move through August and into September.","And as I said a little bit earlier, there is a bit of noise because of some of the shift in timing and what played into July, and how that may have affected some of the shelf resets, and we're working through that now. But I'm not going to provide details. I mean, obviously, there's a competitive sensitivity to sharing some of that data as well. You'll see it play out, but I think it'll play out as you get through the third quarter into the fourth quarter, I think it'll be much clearer in some of that reported data. That's what I would say.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So your confidence then, Brian, is because you have commitments like verbal commitments from customers to make these changes?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","In many cases, yes.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Hey, John.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Irene, you mentioned your belief in gaining market share in a 2% growth category and, I guess, what stands out is maybe your distribution model in China, which enabled gum success, and now we're seeing it again with Milka. How unique is your route-to-market in China and its ability to leverage multiple categories?","And how should we think about your other routes-to-market either by category or geography where the structure may be allows you do more in terms of cross-selling, like where are you not fully maximizing your potential at this point?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Well, I think, John, it's actually \u2013 our route-to-market in China is somewhat unique relative to other markets. But frankly, the success that we've had with gum and now in chocolate is simply the playbook, which is that we intend to have all of our categories available in all of our countries. And so as we think about the emerging markets, most of those countries are dominant single category countries. And slowly but surely, we are bringing our brands into those white spaces, and so chocolate in China is a good example. The opportunity to bring chocolate here to the U.S. is another example. It's not about the nature of the route-to-market. Frankly, it's our investment in the feet on the ground that allow us to have the reach into broader parts of the country.","So the investments that we're making in all of our geographies are designed to give us the infrastructure in Brazil, in China, in India, and South East Asia that will then allow us to put all of our categories through that pipe.","So we have great visibility and optimism about the runway of growth opportunities that will come from the introduction of all of our categories into what is white space for us in a number of markets.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just as a follow-up, in terms of where your resources stand today, what's your ability to get to achieve that with organic resources as opposed to anymore externally on M&A?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","As we've said, we feel very good about the overall composition of the portfolio and about our reach. We are well positioned certainly in the BRIC markets and in a number of the second-tier markets, but we will continue to look for opportunities to supplement that portfolio as we did in Vietnam, with our Kinh Do acquisition.","So in that case, we had a business in Vietnam. It was fairly small. We instantly became the number one snacking company in that country with the acquisition of Kinh Do. So we will continue to look for opportunities to supplement our basic footprint, but we feel quite good about the overall footprint and approximately 40% of our revenue that is in emerging markets.","John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We have time for one final question. Our final question this morning comes from Steven Strycula with UBS.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Congrats, Irene, and Brian, you never showed me your DSD war room. So next time I come to Chicago, I want to see it. But...","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","(52:18)","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Two questions. First one is for Irene for chocolate production. With cross-border taxes being less of an issue going forward, how do you think about freeing up extra capacity locally to feed the U.S. marketplace? And can you speak to some of the success you've had already with the Oreo and Milka launch?","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Is that chocolate specifically, Steve, or just broadly?","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Specific to chocolate.","Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, So one of the things I said in the prepared comments was we have added capacity that that's come online even in the last few weeks, and we now have the capability in the U.S. to accelerate some of our distribution expansion. So you'll see a broader footprint and a bigger market position for Oreo, Milka as that capacities come on.","It's not U.S. based capacity. We will likely, as this business grows and we continue to invest, need to have a discussion around where we put incremental capacity beyond that, and that's something that we probably phase into within the next probably 12 months as we think about that business. But we're not there yet, and we've got plenty of capacity to drive the growth that we have for the second half and into next year.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Irene, for emerging markets, I've heard other CPG companies with more global footprints talk about losing share to local brands in markets like Brazil, similar to what's happening in biscuits right now. What is key to kind of reaccelerating volume and taking back market share in places like Brazil or even Russia? Is it really coming out with more affordable price pack architecture? Or just maybe even launching new brands that are more geared to the lower income demographic? Could you kind of speak to how we kind of accelerate in those markets?","Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.","Yeah, and it's exactly what you said. It is the fact that we are seeing, particularly in challenged economies like Brazil, we are seeing that value pricing is very important to the consumers there. And one of the things that's been a big focus of ours as we have implemented our supply chain reinvention is the opportunity to have more flexible packaging formats available, so that we can provide our products in a variety of packaged formats at different price points.","And so the key for us in competing in, particularly in the emerging markets, with a number of lower-priced local competitors is our ability to create smaller pack sizes of our existing products, and we're finding that is working quite well for us, and that will be a key source of our share gains \u2013 they are actually today a source of share gains and will be increasingly important as we look ahead.","Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the Mondel\u0113z second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines."]}}
