Earnings Conference Call. My name is Jackie, and I will be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes.","I would now like to turn the presentation over to Ms. Rebecca Chambers. Please proceed.","Rebecca Chambers","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2013. During the call today, we will review the financial results released after the close of the market and offer commentary on our commercial activity, after which we will host a question-and-answer session. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at illumina.com.","Participating for Illumina today will be Jay Flatley, President and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Stapley, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Christian Henry, Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Genomic Solutions business. Jay will provide a brief update on the state of our business and Marc will review our third quarter financial results.","This call is being recorded and the audio portion will be archived in the Investors section of our website.

For those of you unable to attend, we encourage you to listen to the webcast presentation, which will be available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jay.","Jay T. Flatley","Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm really excited to share with you today my thoughts on how we've recently reorganized the company for growth, our outstanding Q3 results and a robust outlook for our core sequencing platforms.","Last week, we announced organizational changes that will help us continue our growth in existing markets, take the next steps into new markets and further catalyze the use of our technologies in the clinic. We better aligned our business units with our customers, centralized core cross-company functions and consolidated our commercial channel. These changes are effective January 1, and we're excited to share more with you next year on our progress to catalyze the new market opportunities ahead of us.","Q3 was a remarkable quarter for Illumina, delivering our 8th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $357 million as a result of positive underlying trends across all geographies and most product lines. In the third quarter, approximately 45% of shipments were to commercial, nonprofit and hospital customers, a further demonstration of our increasingly diverse revenue base, less and less exposed to government funding.","Previously, we had projected to reach a goal of 1\/2 our revenue coming from applied markets within 5 years. But given the progress we've made to date, I'm confident we will accomplish this goal shortly.","Over the last few weeks, there's been speculation as to whether the government shutdown would materially impact our fourth quarter results. While the shutdown was very unfortunate for a few of our customers, we have not seen a material impact on spending patterns. Importantly, for most customers, external funding was flowing as expected during the shutdown. With the government now open and operating under a continuing resolution, we're seeing customary purchasing patterns. We expect this to continue going forward as customers and grant allocations maintain preference for sequencing over other technologies, as has been the case for the last few years.","I'll now turn to the specifics of our Q3 results. This quarter, total microarray revenue decreased 3% year-over-year, as a decline in instruments and consumables dollars more than offset substantial demand for genotyping services. This quarter, we processed approximately 90,000 consumer, agriculture and research genotyping samples, a new record and a trend we expect to continue. As we've previously shared, the array market trend is toward large sample numbers at lower complexity and thus lower ASP per sample. As a demonstration of this, year-to-date, Infinium sample orders have already exceeded the total level seen in 2012, as a result of demand for our Infinium, HumanCoreExome and Omni Exome products.","We remain confident in the long-term outlook for the array market, which we believe will be bolstered by recent product introductions, including our updated Infinium arrays, which enable 24 samples per chip. By increasing the samples per array, we improve the economics to our customers and empower them to perform more studies based on even larger sample numbers.","Initially, this format will be rolled out on the OmniExpress and OncoArrays, but will be made broadly available across the Infinium product line next year.","The advancements made in our Array format have facilitated new array pricing that we've recently introduced. While this announcement was made just a short time ago, we've already been in dialogue with customers who are planning new large volume GWAS studies enabled by this pricing. The feedback reinforces our thesis that the array market has remaining elasticity, a theory that we plan to test by unlocking the portion of the market which demands lower price points, including biobank and large agricultural opportunities.","Our custom OncoArray leverages the 24-sample configuration and affordable pricing. This array began shipping in October to early access consortium members and we plan to offer the OncoArray to non-consortium customers in 2014.","Another custom array product that is building excitement is our new PsychArray [ph]. Designed by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and based on the HumanCoreExome chip with an additional 50,000 custom probes, this product will be used to conduct genome-wide meta analysis on large sample numbers in an effort to identify robust and replicable associations. As we move into 2014, we expect additional exciting projects similar to the OncoArray and PsychArrays [ph].","Turning now to our sequencing business. Our results demonstrate our competitive strength, the penetration of NGS into new applied markets and the acceleration of clinical adoption. Sequencing revenue grew 37% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by impressive demand for consumables and HiSeq instruments. Sequencing consumables grew 38% over Q3 of last year due to higher utilization of HiSeq instruments and our larger installed base, as well as growth in our Sample Prep business.","Q3 Sample Prep shipments grew more than 25% year-over-year, due primarily to interest in our Nextera-based product lines. Specifically, our Nextera Rapid Capture custom enrichment and Nextera XT product offerings yet again saw increased demand in the quarter. Year-to-date, shipments have already eclipsed full year 2012, and there continue to be extensive opportunities for growth in this area. We remain focused on delivering a portfolio of Sample Prep products with improved ease-of-use and a more complete user experience.","As part of this focus, our collaborations with leading vendors of robotic platforms have advanced. This quarter, we delivered a fully automated method for TruSeq stranded RNA and have additional automation methods in the late stages of development. This program is an example of our efforts to equip our customers with automated Sample Prep solutions.","Turning now to instruments. Q3 sequencing instrument revenue grew 26% compared to the third quarter of 2012, primarily as a result of robust demand for HiSeq instruments. Since the launch of the HiSeq platform close to 4 years ago, there have only been 4 quarters in which we shipped more than 100 units, the level we shipped in Q3. Current customers remain capacity-constrained. And as a result, more than half of the HiSeq units ordered were from existing customers.","We also saw customers scale their facilities, including centers in Japan targeting biobank sequencing. New customers accounted for approximately 40% of HiSeq orders and as evidence of our extended geographical reach, more than 1\/2 of these customers were located outside the United States.","Commercial, translational and hospital customers continue to place significant value on the benefits of the HiSeq 2500 rapid run technology. This quarter, more than 80% of HiSeq shipments were for the 2500 family, and importantly, commercial and translational customers accounted for about 1\/2 of HiSeq sales. Customer feedback continues to highlight the inherent flexibility and speed provided by the rapid run technology.","In the third quarter, we introduced our new reagent kits for MiSeq, which doubled the throughput to 15G per run by increasing the number of reads and overall read length. With the introduction of this new reagent kit, we have enabled more applications to be run on the platform, including exome sequencing, RNA-Seq and targeted RNA. Interest in this product enhancement has been high, and since launch, approximately 20% of MiSeq reagent revenue has come from the new kit. This product enhancement again furthers the value we deliver to customers by continually improving instrument performance and adding to our leading position in the benchtop sequencing market.","Again, this quarter, more than 50% of MiSeqs were ordered by nonacademic customers due to enthusiasm from pharmaceutical, translational and clinical segments. Many of these customers are interested in our TruSight content sets. To date, close to 200 customers have used our panels, primarily the tumor, inherited cancer and exome sets, and are validating the assays in their laboratory setting, a process which typically takes 9 months.","We also recently introduced our new TruSight 1 panel, which includes more than 4,800 genes with known associated clinical phenotypes. We're excited to hear from more customers at ASHG regarding interest in this new panel.","We remain keenly focused on enhancements to our core technology in areas such as long reads and ordered arrays. Our development efforts in ordered arrays will enable us to selectively deliver kits and applications where we feel the advantage will offer the highest market value. We expect the first customer experience with ordered arrays around yearend and remain very excited to launch both of these technologies.","As you know, our workflow architecture includes BaseSpace, an integrated cloud ecosystem. To date, there have been more than 13,000 launches of applications housed by the BaseSpace App Store. We recently signed new app partners, providing informatics tools for viral metagenomics with path GeneDx [ph] and pathway analysis through GenoMatrix (sic) [GenoMatix]. We have broadened the number and functionality of apps. And as part of our continuing effort, we're hosting a BaseSpace developer meeting today at ASHG with more than 120 developers. The goal of this meeting is to enable networking, idea exchange and education about the BaseSpace platform.","Alongside this event, we announced the BaseSpace native application programming interface, which allows developers to run tests and deploy their apps directly inside the BaseSpace environment. Existing and potential developers will now have a simpler, faster and inexpensive way of making their tools public in a powerful distribution channel.","Moving to FastTrack Services. This quarter, we shipped more than 3,000 whole human genomes, close to a 90% increase from the 1,600 genomes in the prior year period. This quarter saw orders for more than 10,000 genomes, a new record. Our partnership with the Global Genomics Group contributed to this result, and we look forward to working with them to investigate novel biomarkers and biological pathways involved in the development and diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases.","Additionally, today, we announced the start of a 3-year project in collaboration with the University of Cambridge and Genomics England to sequence 10,000 whole genomes of children and young adults with rare genetic diseases. This project is the beginning of the U.K.'s effort to sequence 100,000 genomes and our participation validates our scale in high-throughput sequencing. These programs, alongside many other population projects being discussed, are going to be critical to accelerating the discovery of new associations between the human genome and disease.","We're seeing very rapid adoption of noninvasive prenatal testing and our position in this market has been bolstered with our Verinata acquisition. During the quarter, we signed a supply agreement with Natera and our conversations with other NIPT customers are progressing forward. Verinata is 1 of 2 providers able to service the New York state as a result of the laboratory permit we received for the verifi tests. Importantly, physicians now can recommend verifi for women pregnant with twins, as we've extended the capabilities of the test to this population.","Reproductive health remains a key market and our new organizational structure and leadership will enable us to create a strategic brand position by delivering a more integrated portfolio to our customers.","Given the tremendous opportunities for our sequencing and array technologies, we need to continue to focus our R&D and commercialization priorities. And as a result, we're exiting the qPCR market. This decision was due in part to our belief that sequencing delivers advantages over qPCR technology for gene expression applications. It's important to note that any decision to exit a platform or stop a program is always difficult, but we pride ourselves in being decisive and deliberate when it comes to allocating resources. As a result, we plan to cease selling the Eco qPCR instrument and our NuPCR assays by the end of this year and will continue to provide service and support to the installed base for our customary period.","The financial impact to future non-GAAP revenue and EPS is minimal, and all operating expense currently allocated to the qPCR franchise will be reprioritized to other programs.","In summary, we're seeing significant momentum in our markets, we're focused on finishing 2013 on a high note and we look forward to our opportunities in 2014. We're inspired by what our customers are accomplishing with our technology and remain dedicated to improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc, who'll provide a detailed overview of our third quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley","Thanks, Jay. As Jay mentioned, the third quarter marked another exceptional period for Illumina. This included our second highest order quarter ever and record shipments, both leading to record revenue. Third quarter revenue was $357 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year, which included organic revenue growth of about 20%. Strength in sequencing consumables and continued impressive demand for HiSeq instruments led to this quarterly performance.","Globally, demand for our products remained strong in each region during the third quarter. Revenue in the Americas grew 25% year-over-year and Europe saw a 27% increase over the same period last year. In APAC, revenue grew 22% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in Japan, where HiSeq instruments had a particularly good quarter.","Instrument revenue grew 21% year-over-year to reach $100 million in the third quarter. This increase was primarily driven by incredibly robust year-over-year demand for HiSeq instruments, as well as higher MiSeq shipments. MiSeq orders were down slightly sequentially due in part to multiunit orders in Q2, but were up year-over-year.","This quarter, we completed the remaining HiSeq 2500 upgrades, deriving revenue of $3 million. With the launch of the HiSeq 2500, we've delivered higher data quality, with inherently more flexibility, all at a faster turnaround time. As a result, this is one of our most successful product rollouts to date and customer feedback remains immensely positive.","Consumable revenue in the quarter was $216 million, an increase of 22% compared to the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to our growing installed base, as well as higher demand for Sample Prep and sequencing consumables. Consumable revenue represented 60% of total revenue compared to 62% in both Q2 and the prior year period, primarily due to the further strength this quarter of HiSeq instruments.","In Q3, annual HiSeq pull through per instrument was well within our projected range of 300k to 350k, significantly higher year-over-year and up slightly sequentially as the typical seasonality associated with the vacation season was more than offset by increased customer utilization of core sequencing consumables.","This quarter, MiSeq utilization was below our annual projected pull through range of 45k to 50k. We believe this was due in part to high throughput labs using HiSeqs in place of MiSeqs in an effort to receive the best economics. This trend, in addition to more than 70% of MiSeqs being placed with new customers year-to-date and customers taking 2 to 3 quarters to validate assays under development, has led us to reset our annual MiSeq projected pull through range to 40k to 45k, which we view as a stable range going forward.","Services and other revenue which includes genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenue from Verinata grew more than 60% versus Q3 2012 to equal $38 million. This improvement was driven primarily by an increase in genomes processed year-over-year, demand for our genotyping services from agriculture and consumer customers, the ongoing growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base and revenue from Verinata.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude legal contingencies, impairment of assets primarily associated with the Eco and NuPCR product lines, noncash stock compensation expense, expenses related to Roche's unsolicited tender offer and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 70.2%, as compared to 69.5% in the second quarter, due to lower warranty costs and sales of higher-margin instruments. Year-over-year, gross margins were 30 basis points lower due to the impact of acquisitions and the lower mix of consumables. Adjusted R&D expenses for the quarter was $61 million or 17.2% of revenue, compared to $59 million or 17% of revenue in the second quarter. The sequential increase in R&D expense was primarily due to the impact of headcount addition and the acquisition of ALL, both of which are important components of our long-term growth.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $74 million or 20.6% of revenue compared to $70 million or 23 -- 20.3% of revenue in the previous quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to the acquisition of ALL, additional headcount to support our planned commercial growth and our project focused on improving global business processes.","Adjusted operating margins were 32.4% compared to 32.3% in the second quarter, as higher revenue more than offset the impact of ALL and increased headcount. Compared to the 35.1% reported in the third quarter of last year, adjusted operating margins were lower due to the impact of acquisitions, as well as increased investment in R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth.","In the third quarter, we recognized approximately 800k of adjusted other income. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29.4% compared to 33.9% in the third quarter of last year and lower than expected due to a onetime adjustment to prior year returns related to the R&D tax credit. Non-GAAP net income was $63 million for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS was $0.45. This compares to non-GAAP income and EPS of $54 million and $0.41, respectively, in the third quarter of 2012.","We reported GAAP net income of $31 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the third quarter compared to $30 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior year period. Current period results include an impairment charge of $25 million for the remaining assets associated with the Eco and NuPCR product lines and $4 million recorded in cost of goods to reflect the ongoing royalty associated with BeadChip sales, plus interest.","Expenses related to Roche's unsolicited tender offer were $1 million. Going forward, we're very pleased to announce that we do not expect to incur further tender offer-related expense as the associated contracts have come to an end. We generated cash flow from operations of $83 million during the third quarter, capital expenditures were $19 million, resulting in $64 million of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.03 billion in cash and short-term investments; Q3 inventory was $160 million, lower than the second quarter, despite sequential revenue growth.","DSO increased modestly to 60 days compared to 55 days last quarter as a result of a significant percentage of shipments in the last month, as was expected for Q3.","As mentioned on our Q2 call, during the quarter, we retired approximately 3 million warrants associated with the 2014 convertible debt call spread for $125 million. As we have outlined, our business has exceeded our expectations year-to-date. And as a result, we are boosting both our revenue and earnings per share guidance. For 2013, we are now projecting approximately 22% total company revenue growth, an increase in the previous guidance of 20%, and full year non-GAAP EPS of $1.75 to $1.77, higher than our prior guidance of $1.68 to $1.72, which reflects a strong EPS figure in Q3 and ongoing investments that will occur in Q4. These projections include the impact of the Verinata and the ALL acquisitions, as well as additional investments expected to incur in Q4 to support our long-term growth.","Assumptions embedded in this guidance include full year gross margin of 69.5%, stock compensation expense of $105 million, and the full year pro forma tax rate of 30%.","Lastly, at the current stock price, full year weighted diluted shares outstanding are expected to be 139 million. In summary, we have had really encouraging year-to-date results. We remain focused on building our business to support a multibillion-dollar revenue stream and are driving what we believe to be the most innovative commercial and product strategies to support the long-term opportunities that we face.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question, plus a related follow-up, if necessary. Operator, we'll now open the line to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First one, just on the reorganization. I guess, with the new divisions, we've been getting a little bit -- few more questions about your plans in oncology. Wondering if you can talk a little bit more about this strategy there and maybe the thought process behind the reorg?","Jay T. Flatley","I'll be happy to, Tycho. So the strategy in oncology is to focus on continuous improvement of the tool set that we provide to that market. We don't believe, as we've stated previously, that Illumina is going to take a proprietary position in particular tests in the oncology market that we would provide through our own lab operations, but rather, we're going to continue to improve the sequencer, obviously, as well as the automation of the Sample Prep, focus on specific aspects of Sample Prep that need to be optimized for the oncology market and really fine tune the software to make the ability to decipher cancer genomes ever more powerful. And so it's really a focus on the customer base for oncology, as well as improving that tool set that this business unit will be focused on.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, a follow-up, just on the funding, and I appreciate your comment on the government shutdown, but a number of labs did miss the October funding cycle. Can you just talk about how we think about a lag effect to the extent that some of those customers now have to wait until February to submit grants?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, there may be a few of those, Tycho. But we think it's really going to be noise in our financials. So we haven't seen any specific changes in our forecast as a result of labs not getting funded. So that there certainly probably are a few of those, but we don't think there's going to be any impact on us.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You talked about growth in the clinical applied and commercial markets. In our checks, it seems like demand from biopharmaceutical companies is driving increased utilization of sequencers at many of your existing customers' labs. And the sense we get is there could be a number of new partnerships announced over coming months pursuant to areas such as companion diagnostic and biomarker research. I'm wondering, are you seeing any notable increase in demand from biopharma for instruments directly? Or do you expect biopharma for at least the near term to be more of an indirect driver to demand through existing customers?","Jay T. Flatley","I'd say some of both, Doug. We certainly have seen increased demand for instrument purchases for the routine research going on in the biopharmaceutical industry and we get orders for the labs around the world on a routine basis. We also have seen a real shift in the technology focus for companion diagnostics, I'd say probably over the last 18 to 24 months, moving away from 1 or 2 biomarkers that are typically measured using PCR, much more toward sequencing the entire genes that are relevant as a potential diagnostic for their medicines. And that's for obvious reasons that we now understand that there's many variants in these genes that could cause the gene to misfunction or malfunction. So we're very optimistic about the potential for companion diagnostics to move towards sequencing. I think, in terms of partnerships, they are always challenging because the need of the pharmaceutical industry is to have a product ready the day a drug gets released into the market, be globally available. And as we all know, the fraction of those drugs that actually get approved by the FDA is pretty small. So making a very large investment years before a drug decision date is a challenging business model. So we're working through that, but I think there is going to be a big opportunity for us there.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, one more question. For a while, there have been concerns that Illumina is on the cusp of losing momentum or saturating the market for instruments that have an ASP around $700,000. And then, you head into this period where you said you could see a seasonal slowdown and there was certainly concern about funding uncertainty and then you placed 100 HiSeqs. I think, over the last couple of months, you held your planning meetings for 2014. It might be interesting for us to hear about areas where you think you could be on the cusp of a slowdown and maybe some other areas where you think you're still in the very early innings. And keeping in mind, the Street continues to model a moderation in the pace of HiSeq placements over coming quarters, it would be interesting to hear if you're seeing anything that would really make sense at all that suggests that, that makes sense at all?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we've continued to be surprised a bit on the upside, frankly, by the HiSeq performance. So we didn't model HiSeqs to be quite as good as they have been over the past year. But I think it's reflective of the fact that the world just needs to do more and more sequencing. As we model out our existing markets and the new emerging market opportunities, the demand for sequencing over the next 5 years is going to be absolutely enormous. And we've said this for years and years, we do believe that we're still very early in the cycle of how sequencing will be applied. There is no other displacing technology that's likely to come online in the next 5 years. And so we continue to believe that this is going to be an absolutely enormous market and there will be demand for very high throughput instrumentation at ever decreasing prices per genome. And I think that all fuels the strategy around the high-end part of our product line.","Marc A. Stapley","Yes, I also think, Jay, that the fact that the 2500, that we were able to develop that technology and improve the utility of the system, enabled us to get into accounts that wanted to get into high throughput sequencing, but the turnaround time was just a little bit too long. And so the 2500 has given us that boost in terms of market penetration that I think will continue to extend into the future.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So on your decision to sort of exit the PCR market, is that more a reflection on just the competitive landscape in that market and sort of the pricing dynamic and that the entrenched players are more entrenched? Or that other people have entered that market and so pricing's just coming down so fast that you're not seeing that you have a competitive advantage?","Jay T. Flatley","There are number of factors. Certainly, it is a highly competitive market and we recognized that going in. And part of our strategy, in fact, was to take the pricing in this market to a point that we thought Eco would support and I think we were very successful strategically in doing that. I think, the second factor is the reality that many PCR applications, more and more of them, are moving towards sequencing. And I think, the third reality is that as we, year-to-year, compare the project opportunities we have for R&D investment, we never could get the PCR projects over the threshold. And so we always have more array and sequencing programs that have higher ROI to the company than the PCR programs had. And for us to be successful in that market, we would have had to continue to evolve the instrumentation and develop lots more assays. And those investments just didn't make sense compared to our alternatives.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. So obviously, you have the BaseSpace as an issue today. And one of the questions I continue to get from investors is, are you guys actually making money on BaseSpace? Or have you demonetized that asset? Could you just give a little bit more about how we should think about that in our financial models?","Jay T. Flatley","I wouldn't put anything in the financial models for now on BaseSpace. We are starting to make some money on the paid applications, but it's immaterial to our revenue. We do have, as I think I've mentioned previously, a wide-ranging model of what BaseSpace could potentially yield to us. But we're being very conservative in our own internal modeling on that. We're very excited about the progress we're making and we're anxious to get feedback from the developer conference today to see if we've sort of kicked the enthusiasm up to another level.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Jay, I thought maybe you could give us a little more color on your ex-U.S. trends in the quarter. I think you mentioned more than 50% of your instruments on the NGA side were from orders -- excuse me, orders came from ex-U.S. customers. Can you put some maybe color around that? Are these direct government orders? Kind of what's the sense of breakdown between government, academic and clinical? Any insight you can shed about what the future looks like ex-U.S.?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I'd say first in general, we had surprising strength in Europe in the quarter. Q3, because of the summer holidays, we're always a little worried about Europe in July and August. And it turned out to be very strong for us with growth, really the strongest year-to-year in that region. In terms of instrument placements, we saw a real strength in Asia on the HiSeq platforms. So a couple of very large accounts, particularly those in Japan, were buying HiSeqs to begin to focus on biobank sequencing. So we probably exceeded our plan on HiSeqs in the Asian territory. I'd say overall mix, we grew in research, but we were probably stronger growth rates outside of research.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then maybe on the U.S. traditional academic customer base, I think at our conference, you had indicated one of the surprising observations or features, was just how high the utilization level was of those customers. I'm just kind of wondering, is -- maybe can you tease out the demand drivers there? I mean, certainly I think you've enabled better Sample Prep process probably fill their -- kind of fill the tanks more and you also have more grant dollars coming in. But kind of how sustainable do you think the trends are from some of your bigger U.S. academic customers?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we're pretty confident in the trends, Dan. I mean, they're feeling really good. What we've done around the system certainly helps. It's much easier for customers to prepare samples and get them into the sequencers. The software is vastly easier now, much more automated, takes less compute power to analyze a genome. The better we can do at allowing people to deduce the relevant biology from the result allows them to pour more money back into sequencing because they get to the answer faster. So I think all of that has helped build the pipeline for samples coming into these centers. The breadth of applications has helped a lot as we've expanded our portfolio more and more into RNA applications, into metagenomics. I mean, this whole idea now of sequencing the flora in the gut is getting a lot of traction. I think cancer sequencing is beginning to come on more and more. And so the increasing application breadth, coupled in part to the fact that we're continuing to reduce the cost per base, is just expanding the market as we'd hoped it would.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So I had a question on the Cancer Panel. I'm curious, obviously, you're not directly kind of having conversations with the payers. But just in terms of your end users, what are they saying about payer propensity to reimburse for some of these more complex cancer panels? And just curious in terms of physician adoption, what that's looking like.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, for the more complex panels, it's more challenging because there's a relatively small set of reimbursed genes right now that are routinely reimbursed and I don't know exactly what that number is but I think it's in the range of 6 to 10. And those are typically reimbursed historically using stacked codes from PCR. That's all changing now with the new coding systems. We could probably get information from Foundation on their larger panel, in terms of reimbursement rates. I don't know -- happen to know what it is. But I think as the increased validation of the cancer panels comes into the marketplace, you're going to see increased levels of reimbursement. And just, I think, today or yesterday, Foundation published some information about analytic validity of their FoundationOne test.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And then just switching topics on the microarray business. I'm just curious, is there anything to keep in mind from a comparison standpoint quarter-over-quarter? And then also just -- should we be thinking about that business -- I know you've said kind of flat, I think historically. Should we be thinking about that being maybe down a little bit year-over-year going forward?","Jay T. Flatley","I think flat is the right place to have it. It bounces around a little bit from quarter to quarter depending upon what happens in the consumer markets and other places. So I think flat is probably the right place to hold your model. In terms of quarter-to-quarter comparisons, Marc, anything that you have on your mind?","Marc A. Stapley","Nothing. No, nothing really. I mean, don't forget BlueGnome is in that number and BlueGnome is doing well. I would say, as you go forward with the new pricing model that Jay talked about, we have to see how that -- we're testing the elasticity, we have to see how that works out a little bit. But I agree with Jay on the flat modeling as probably the right thing to do.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. It ebbs and flows a little bit, Amanda, as well because when we launch a new product like in Q4 with the Psych and OncoArrays, we have some new products beginning to ship and we have some pent-up demand for those products. And then as those get into the marketplace next year, we'll launch other targeted arrays.","Christian O. Henry","I do think that we are -- continued to be committed to investing in the array platform and you see that with the 24 sample array. That really opens up new markets and there are a lot of different discussions in agriculture in other areas that are ongoing that give us some sense of why this business will continue to be an important part of what we do going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe one on the clinical side of things. Jay, are you able to give us a rough sense of how at this point you feel like the overall clinical HiSeq rounds are breaking down collectively in terms of panels versus exomes versus whole genomes?","Jay T. Flatley","I don't have any statistics in front of me on that, Dan. I would say clinically, whole genomes -- these are guesses, are probably in the range of 5%, 10%. Exomes are probably, I don't know, 25% or 30% and the rest would be targeted panels.","Christian O. Henry","Yes. I think that's probably -- at least 1\/2 of it's got to be panel driven.","Jay T. Flatley","Right.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, okay. That helps. Just trying to get a sense for what the user base is looking at this point. And I guess, as a follow-up, you mentioned that some Sample Prep products are in their advanced stages and informatics is getting its own business. So can you just sort of give us an update on where the R&D priorities are today? What are you focusing on? And then maybe if you'd be willing to make a comment on some of those new upfront products, that would be great.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I could say, generically, a large fraction of our R&D is always focused on new platform technologies. So you can imagine about 1\/2 of the overall R&D spend, if you take research out of it, I'm talking about product development here, is focused on what's happening in our platforms. And so that would be sort of the core sequencing reagents and instrumentation and evolutions of those platforms. Probably of their other half, probably 1\/2 of that is focused on various assay methods and automation of those assay methods, including now we're spending money on our investments in ALL and bringing that technology into the product portfolio. And so hopefully, we'll see some very nice developments there over the next couple of years. And then the remainder is in software and we continue to put a lot of emphasis on the back end part of the software as we've gotten better and better at sort of processing the raw data off the machine, we need to now move downstream and figure out how do we help our customers interpret genomes much more quickly and efficiently.","Marc A. Stapley","And the other element -- I mean, Jay already mentioned research. And the other element within development would be some of the clinical trials and studies and things that Verinata, for example, might do to drive the twins' test recently, for example. That's just one of those specific examples.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffrey.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, Jay, could you elaborate on the 40% of HiSeq placements going to new customers? Are these competitive -- I guess, former competitive platform customers? Or generally speaking, are they fairly new to sequencing?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, it's some of both. So some of those customers are customers who have been using alternate technologies that are now coming over to HiSeq. Some are capillary customers that are finally moving over to NGS and moving to our platform. Some are new labs and institutions that we've been in previously but are now getting funding to build their own sequencing labs. So it's a mix of those 3 different situations.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then as a follow-up, you commented on the MiSeq consumables in the quarter. Can you just give us an update in terms of the overall placement trends?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I'd say placements for the quarter were about on target for what we expected. As Marc mentioned, sequentially, the order rate was down a little bit but not materially. So we feel really good about the platform. We continue to have a very high win ratio, about what we've said in the past, if not maybe a little bit better. So we continue to feel really good about MiSeq.","Marc A. Stapley","And though shipments were, as I must have said in the remarks, shipments were up quarter-over -- year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter and orders were up as well year-over-year.","Jay T. Flatley","Year-over-year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","The first one had to do with just the commercial","[Technical Difficulty]","So I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the type of person you're looking to lead that division, whether that person would be sort of from an academic background or clinical or perhaps biopharma.","Jay T. Flatley","We missed the beginning of the question, Isaac. So which business unit?","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So for the oncology unit, I think Richard Klausner was named as interim head. So I'm just wondering as you think about a permanent solution, what kind of a person are you looking for?","Jay T. Flatley","We're looking for somebody who has domain expertise in cancer, so they need to be technically embedded in the world of what's going on in cancer genomics. But we also need somebody who is an operator, somebody who can work with our customers, work on large deal transactions, can run a group of development teams that will be inside the business unit. And so it needs to be a combination of somebody who's technologically savvy and has a strong operational background.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then maybe just on the technology for a minute. We have seen -- obviously, you guys have a dominant position in the marketplace today. But at the same time, there have been some competitive wins away where the customer said its speed is a factor. So I'm just wondering, how big a percentage of the clinical market ballpark do you think, for example, infectious disease, might require faster turnaround time? Is that an area where you think the SBS chemistry can still make material improvements? Or do you think it's sort of less relevant of a factor when you add it all up?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, first, I'd say that SBS will continue to get better on cycle time. We've made enormous improvements over the last few years and we will continue to make great improvements there. We think that cycle time for most applications on the MiSeq product is good enough. For many of the experiments that our customers do on MiSeq, it happens roughly in a shift. If you're doing much longer read lengths, which only we can do on the desktop platforms, then it might stretch out to 1 day or maybe a little bit longer. I think there is going to be, in the long run, a market for very rapid turnaround, which might be 15 minutes to half an hour. But I don't think there's any technology yet that's really addressing that market segment. And I don't think that will be enormous. But there will be, if you fast forward a couple of years, an opportunity to develop technologies for doing screening of patients entering hospitals, as an example, triage. But no one can quite do that yet.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jay, I didn't hear you mention anything about Moleculo in your prepared comments. So could you give us an update there on early demand and workflow improvements?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. So we're running that in our service laboratory now. So I alluded to it briefly in the technology section. We are working on the kit version of Moleculo and we expect to have that, Christian?","Christian O. Henry","First part of next year.","Jay T. Flatley","In early next year --","Christian O. Henry","Yes.","Jay T. Flatley","Is when we think that kit will hit the marketplace. So we're -- we continue to be very excited about the enabling capability that those long -- synthetic long reads will bring to the market.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And second, your commentary about just Asian demand. In the past, you've called China out specifically for strong quarters. Can you talk about China specifically this time around? And have you been able to renew an agreement with BGI on the clinical side?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We don't have anything specific to say on China for the quarter. In terms of country-by-country, we don't normally break it down publicly to that level of granularity. I think that we do continue to believe that overall, the China market is a very strong opportunity for us going forward and we're making continued investments there, both in feet-on-the-street and also in some partnership-type opportunities. With respect to BGI, we do not yet have the clinical agreements signed.","Operator","And our next question comes the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.","Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jay, if I could just stick with Moleculo. Could you comment on the phasing analytic services and where you are using Moleculo in-house? And with those early access customers, I think in the past quarter, there seemed to be some excitement, has that grown? In other words, have early access customers increased? And second question is where are you from a timing perspective on MiSeqDx, CF and a post CE mark?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I don't actually have the statistics on how many customers have run Moleculo in the quarter, so I don't have that data in front of me. We can probably come back to you with some information about that. But I think from what I've heard, the people that are using it are getting great results and the performance of the technology is really good. With respect to the FDA approvals, we have a number of approvals in front of the FDA, the analytical version of the instrument, as well as the CF panel. And we are simply waiting for the approvals to happen. There's no way to predict when those might come out. And I think at least parts of the FDA were shut down during the government closures. And so that probably put a little bit of a delay into the process.","Operator","And our next question comes the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","My first question, how should we think about the level of investment necessary to support your new organizational structure? Should we think that 2014 is another investment year?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I think the other way to think about that is that it will be an investment year, but one that's scaled back to some extent from what we did in 2013. So you can think about expenses growing more in line with revenue. Next year is certainly not an increase and maybe a bit of a decrease as our overall percentage of revenue.","Marc A. Stapley","But I wouldn't necessarily tie that to the organizational change, the organizational structure. I don't think that really adds anything material to what we would otherwise already have been planning.","Jay T. Flatley","Our goal there is to try and make the organizational change neutral with respect to expenses. So it's not -- Marc is exactly right, it's not driven by the org change.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up question, can you comment on whether or not Verinata's on track with your plan from a financial perspective? It seems like it ranked last in your contributors for year-over-year service growth. And also, whether it's on track towards your 2014 expectation, when you expect it to be accretive?","Marc A. Stapley","Yes, we'll update on 2014 when we come to give 2014 guidance. But Verinata is doing very well. You have to remember that Verinata for us, is -- it's really broader than just Verinata, it's the NIPT business. And the business case of Verinata was based on how well NIPT does relative to had we not completed the acquisition. So tracking it along that basis, it's doing pretty much as we anticipated. But as we said, there was a lot of -- there's going to be a lot of delicacy in the negotiations. And while Jay said, we've actually agreed, one, everything else is progressing forward. So more information to come on that in the future.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple, actually. Both are sort of follow-ups to questions already asked. But the one question earlier on pharma and companion diagnostics, since we've gotten to talking to pharma companies, I thought usually with these companion diagnostic agreements, they're generating paying for most of the developments, sort of a cost-plus model? The way you kind of spoke to it, it sounded like the risk and the long term uncertainty around it is maybe a reason not to do too many of those. I just want to make sure I'm understanding that correctly. Was it more from a resource side or is it more on a cost side that you're talking about the risk on companion diagnostics?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I didn't mean to imply that Illumina would take the financial risk. What I meant to imply was that there is a financial risk that has to be taken which makes the agreements typically a little more challenging to strike on the one hand. It also, for us, is an opportunity-cost question because with a particular set of resources, even if they're fully funded externally, if the therapeutic fails at the end of that, the return on those resources that we've applied is essentially 0. And we've lost the opportunity to apply those resources somewhere else. So that's -- those are the aspects that make that a bit more challenging for us.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, makes sense. And then the second question, just you were talking earlier about the platforms and your kind of maybe very rapid turnarounds as being something for the future. What would you say may be more near-term if you had to think about sort of the areas where your customers are looking for the most advancement? Is it more -- is it on speed? Is it more on the cost side? Is it ease of use? If you just had to sort of qualitatively describe where you're seeing the most interest in improvements, that would be helpful.","Jay T. Flatley","I think we've made tremendous improvements in the speed side of the equation, and the 2500 is a great example of how important it was to take the sequencing run from 10 days down to 1 day. I think for the kinds of applications that a HiSeq is used for in the high end, we're in the ballpark of what customers need there. If we cut that in half, it probably wouldn't make much difference to customers. I think the next really big area that customers care a lot about is increasing the level of integration. So that is related to simplicity of Sample Prep, integration of Sample Prep, which inherently reduces human error in the process and allows them to process -- to feed more samples through the pipeline. And probably secondarily, improvements in software to make the analysis more automated. So I think those are 2 areas we're putting a significant amount of investment in and will overall grow the market and allow us to penetrate more deeply into some of these emerging markets.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Tim Evans with Wells Fargo Securities.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just wondering where you stand in your build out of your commercial organization. Specifically, should we be thinking about your SG&A as a percentage of revenue trending up further from here?","Jay T. Flatley","I don't think it would have to trend up much as a percentage of revenue. So we haven't finalized '14 planning yet and we certainly aren't prepared to give guidance today. But we've increased a bit from where we were last year and we may wind up somewhere between flat and up a little bit probably next year as a percentage of revenue.","Timothy C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the BGI, are those negotiations for the clinical contracts still ongoing?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So both on the clinical side, first, can you comment on what you're seeing in terms of interest uptake and specific applications of clinical sequencing with the academic hospital labs?","Jay T. Flatley","So by that, do you mean the academic labs in a place like Stanford and MD Anderson?","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Right, you got it.","Jay T. Flatley","I'd say, it's very broad. Most of them [ph] today are focused on using various panels, some of which begin by taking our 2 side panels and building on them. Some of which are 100% home brewed where they develop the panels on their own. They're typically running a wide-ranging set of panels that are targeted at different diseases. But I'd say the uptake in those kinds of institutions is particularly strong. Much more so than -- and that really is the focal point of the clinical market now as opposed to, say, community hospitals, where we're still probably a ways away from putting sequencers in community hospitals.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Understood. And then curious if you could just provide an update on the NIPD space as a whole. How fast do you think it's growing currently? Any color on U.S. versus ex-U.S.? And where do you think we are in terms of penetration of that high-risk opportunity?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we haven't seen the reported numbers from the other players this quarter as of yet. So we don't know how many tests were run by the players other than Illumina, other than Verinata. So it's still hard to say exactly what the test volumes are doing right now. We do have a bit of a surrogate in terms of reagent purchases but those can be time delayed either forward or backward a bit. So it's a little hard to be specific there. So I think we'll know a lot more in a couple of weeks once we learn what those test volumes look like. Geographically, the market still is largely a U.S. market. But China is coming on quite strong. And last year, there were some speculation that the Chinese test volume was in the order of the U.S. test volume but at much lower price points. So the revenue would have been much less in China. Europe is much slower on the uptake as you would expect.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So on the M&A front -- you guys have done a great job last year or so in terms of adding tuck-in technologies. What are the areas where you're seeing the greatest amount of activity or maybe greatest amount of focus in terms of where you see sort of exciting technologies? Informatics, Sample Prep? Just sort of -- I'm curious from a directional perspective where you're spending most of your time. Or is it maybe also on the clinical side?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we continue to look quite broadly. I mean, we have a very active M&A program in department now. So I think opportunities can fall across the spectrum, probably a bit biased toward methods for Sample Prep or targeting methods, things of that nature and perhaps Informatics, less so maybe on sort of core instrument areas. But we continue to look at lots of different technologies. Many companies come to see us to talk about potential strategic partnerships or investments. So we get to look at many of them before we make a decision on whether to do anything with them and, of course, the vast majority of them we pass on. So we'll continue to probably do a handful of these tuck-ins a year is probably what you might expect from us.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And what did the experience with Eco sort of teach you? I guess, it's an asset you obviously knew intimately and incredibly well. It's a market that at one point made quite a bit of sense for you guys to be in tangentially. How does sort of -- given the vast set of opportunities you have in sort of the existing business set with sort of the technologies that you're already dominant in, how do you sort of -- how does Eco -- does it change at all sort of your risk tolerance in terms of moving into new boxes or into new verticals? Or was that just sort of a, \"Well, we tried -- we made a go of it, it's a tough market and so we've decided to reallocate\"?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, the reason we got into it to start with, Ross, if I could back up for a minute is because probably about 5 years ago, maybe 6 years ago, strategically, it looked very important for us to have technology capability at the single to a few marker level and that really completed the spectrum of our offering from one snip to the entire genome. And that made a lot of sense where if you look at the markets and how we thought they were going to evolve and where sequencing was at the time, that fit really nicely in our strategic plan and even though it was a competitive market, the potential carry along [ph] sale we thought made a lot of sense for us. And as I described, what happened is as we brought that technology in, while it met our expectations in many ways, what we weren't able to do is to justify continued investment at a sufficient level on that platform to make it a long-term viable business. And at the same time, the sequencing has gotten so much better, cheaper, faster and all the great attributes of our sequencers now that we think PCR is becoming less relevant in many of the markets that we had originally targeted. So clearly, there's some lessons there that we will employ going forward. I don't think it creates any inherent aversion to us tackling another business that might have a box component to it. But I guess what it does do is it makes us look very hard at our core sequencing business to make sure we realize how good it is and whether any new venture we make has to stand up competitively against our opportunities in sequencing.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's Q&A session.

I\u2019m delighted to reported that we successfully navigated the challenges of our recent product introductions and as a result recorded record quarters in revenue in Q1.","We saw astonishing demand for our new instruments the NextSeq 500 and HiSeq X Ten, all the existing systems and our sequencing portfolio exceeded our expectations. Additionally, development activities for the other new products announced in January are tracking to our committed timelines.","For the quarter, revenue of $421 million greatly exceeded our internal plan and marked our 10th quarter of sequential growth. Growth was 27% year-over-year as a result of positive underlying trends across all geographies and a universally positive reaction to our new sequencing systems.","First quarter total sequencing revenue grew 36% year-over-year, driven by impressive demand for consumables, our new and existing instruments and services. These results clearly demonstrate the strength of our sequencing portfolio with instrument options for customers at every experimental scale and across all applications.","Sequencing instrument revenue grew 40% compared to the first quarter of 2013, as a result of strong demand across the entire product lines. With two major platform announcements, we cautioned that we might see positive purchases while customers reevaluated their alternatives. Any pause was brief as instrument orders across the portfolio set a record and significant need beat our internal forecast.","The unprecedented demand for the HiSeq X Ten exceeded our most aggressive assumptions and moving into the second quarter, we expect to book additional systems. To date, we\u2019ve received orders from nine customers for a total of 104 HiSeq Xs already doubling our original forecast. This includes an order from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, which I\u2019m pleased to announce today.","We\u2019re in conversations with a number of other customers around the globe who are interested in purchasing X Ten Systems to perform population level sequencing. The response we\u2019ve seen to the $1,000 of genomes reinforces our views that as far out as we can see, there is an insatiable demand for whole-genome sequencing.","We\u2019ve booked revenue on 12 HiSeq Xs in Q1, and importantly machines installed during the quarter are already producing high quality data in customer hands. Sequencing runs are consistently generating over 1.8 TF data in three days with many runs in excess of 2T. The quality of HiSeq X data has also been exceptionally high, which runs producing well in excess of the 80% Q30 basis.","We\u2019re actively scaling our manufacturing capabilities to meet this over-planned demand. As a reminder, there are two components of our supply chain that are critical in ramping production. The high resolution cameras and the pattern flow cells.","We\u2019re now optimistic about the ability to acquire sufficient cameras from our supplier to satisfy the additional demand. That said, volume production of the pattern flow cells has only recently begun. And as a result, we believe flow cell production rates will be key factor in scaling HiSeq X shipments through the end of 2014.","As I mentioned last quarter, the introduction of HiSeq X allowed us to rationalize pricing in FastTrack Services so that it\u2019s more economical to send samples to the Illumina genome network than to our FastTrack Services lab.","As a result, in the first quarter, we saw close to 70% of samples submitted to an IGM partner compared to less than 10% in the fourth quarter of last year. This was consistent with our expectation that FastTrack Services will grow more slowly than previously seen.","Overall demand for the HiSeq family of products has increased over the last few quarters, and this trend continued in Q1. Shipments were higher sequentially due to improved ASPs as customers purchased and shifted toward HiSeq 2500 and X Ten from the HiSeq 1500 and 2000.","New customers accounted for approximately 70% of HiSeq orders, close to a record. The majority of which were commercial clinical and hospital customers. Importantly, many of these customers were in the early phases of their assay development and validation, creating a potential for follow-on orders as our methods into production.","We witnessed some cannibalization of HiSeq buying new products. However the magnitude of this impact was well within our forecast. As we expected, some of the customers who opted for NextSeq over HiSeq bought multiple units.","Over the next 12 months or so, we expect HiSeq customers with older generation instruments to consider whether the HiSeq 2500, HiSeq X Ten or the NextSeq would be best suited to the emerging applications, economics and workflows.","HiSeq 2500 remains a very important part of our instrument portfolio with a long roadmap ahead of it, including enhancements to throughput and read align. One such enhancement, the 1T kits began shipping last week, and now allowed generation of approximately 8 human genomes in six days. The 2x250 read align kits will ship later this quarter.","The NextSeq product launch is going extremely well, resulting in shipments of 65 instruments in Q1. As we would expect, approximately 85% of early orders came from existing customers with approximately half originating from non-academic sources. These customers are running targeted panels RNASeq, exome and NIPT applications and find flexibility of NextSeq key to managing their workflow.","Early customer feedback on NextSeq has been very favorable. More than 90% of shipments have been installed in a single day with early sights noting the high data quality, flexible vast sizes and fast run-time as important attributes of the platform.","We\u2019re very pleased with the order pipeline for NextSeq as we educate new customers on the system\u2019s capabilities. From our 60-city road-show and numerous webcasts, we generated over 2,500 leads of new customers demonstrating that this product is additive to our total addressable opportunity.","New customers account for a third of the current pipeline and clinical accounts are prominent in the file. Additionally, we have significant interest in our trading program for competitive platforms and expect this to drive incremental orders in future quarters.","Demand from HiSeq reached record levels in the quarter with the highest unit shipments since launch. This result was catalyzed by the FDA\u2019s recent clearance and the lower list price of MiSeq and MiSeq DX at $99,000 and $125,000 respectively.","Importantly, approximately two thirds of instruments were ordered by government commercial translational and clinical customers. This included an order from the Department of Defense for 12 MiSeq, to be used by the army and the navy in a bio-surveillance program focusing an whole-genome sequencing of bacteria and viruses.","Additionally in the first quarter, we received follow-on, multi-unit orders from existing customers building capacity in production facilities. An example of this is HistoGenetics, which first placed an order in Q2 of last year.","The additional instruments will be used for high-resolution sequence based HLA testing services and today HistoGenetics business is the largest fleet of MiSeqs in our installed base.","Cannibalization of MiSeq by NextSeq was insignificant, with approximately two thirds of orders from new customers. We\u2019re not currently projecting significant cannibalization of MiSeq as we believe the platform is uniquely suited for specific applications and customer groups.","Moving now to arrays, this quarter total micro array revenue increased 4% year-over-year due to growth in genotyping services and our IVF products which was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in array instruments and consumables. New array consumable pricing introduced in the fourth quarter drove samples ordered close to record levels, demonstrating the elasticity of the market. This change fuelled increased demand for Onco array as well as whole-genome arrays, specifically the Omni Express exome and core exome products.","Our Ag business also contributed strongly to the Q1 results as orders grew 20% year-over-year driven in part by demand for the BovineLD Plus and the iSelect arrays. We continue to see expanded use of selective breeding based on genotype in crop and livestock with a significant number of customers standardizing on Illumina\u2019s products.","We remain focused on delivering complete sampled answer workflows enabling new markets to embrace NGS technology through a variety of applications. Our NeoPrep Library prep system, with radically simpler workflow remains on track for a summer launch and early feedback from customers is extremely positive.","Additionally, we began shipping our BaseSpace Onsite platform late in the first quarter. Translational customers have shown early interest citing the simple user interface in installation as transformative to their ability to bring next generation sequencing into their labs.","As a demonstration of the diversification of our business, again this quarter, commercial non-profit and hospital customers accounted for approximately half of shipments despite an improved funding environment for academic customers in the U.S. and the impact of the Horizon 20-20 Program.","Sequencing uptake in the oncology market is gaining significant traction based in part on feedback from recent customer conferences. As we shared our Investor Day in January, we\u2019re collaborating the number of oncology thought leaders to drive standards for the use of NGS in a clinical setting.","Feedback from the AACR conference, for which the standard is being a critical factor for driving adoption to continue further our discussions with major cancer centers, pharma, guideline setting bodies and the FDA on this topic, with extremely strong interest from the field.","We also recently introduced two new oncology products that were shipped this quarter. The TruSeq RNA Access Library Prep kit was our new solution for RNA analysis from FFPE tissues or other low-quality, low-input samples. The TruSight Myeloid sequencing panel is the latest expansion of our TruSight family of products, which includes the very successful TruSight One panel. This panel uses expert curetted content to identify somatic mutations in myeloid malignancies in an accurate, efficient and cost effective manner.","With reproductive and genetic health, we made significant progress during the first quarter in both IVS and NIPG. We successfully launched our pre-implementation genetic diagnostics products CytoSNP Karyomapping.","Additionally our sequencing based pre-implantation genetic screening product VeriSeq PGS, will launch shortly for use on the MiSeq platform and will be available on NextSeq later this year.","Recently the Journal of Fertility and sterility published in extensive preclinical validation and accuracy assessment in our VeriSeq product for aneuploidy screening on single cells. They found a high level of consistency between our solution and established methodology such as Array CGH. The study concluded VeriSeq PGS is a robust high throughput method ready for clinical application and reproductive medicine, citing potential advantages of reduced cost and enhanced position.","During the first quarter, we announced a publication to the New England Journal of Medicine, which directly compared the use of NIPT using cell free DNA, standard prenatal aneuploidy screening in the average risk population. The seminal study was the first in a number of studies that are being performed to demonstrate the efficacy of NIPT and the screening tool for the average risk population, a market which we believe is up to six times larger than our current market.","The NIPT market continues to grow at a breathtaking rate and we\u2019re very pleased with the performances verified in the first quarter. Not only we verified volumes and revenues come in at record levels, we also completed tech transfer agreements in France, Germany and Italy, and we\u2019re in discussions with more than two dozen other potential tech transfer customers.","As a result of this performance, Verinata was only slightly dilutive this quarter and is on track to breakeven on a non-GAAP basis for the full year.","In summary, Q1 was another remarkable quarter with significant uptake of our new sequencing platforms coupled with strong interest in our existing systems. We\u2019re extremely well positioned to address opportunities at every scale and are focused on developing the large untapped markets is bearing fruits faster than we had projected.","We\u2019re confident in our technology leadership and believe we will continue to deliver significant growth as we unlock the power of the genome.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our first quarter results.","Marc Stapley","Thanks Jay. As Jay described, Q1 marked another exceptionally strong quarter for Illumina.","Revenue grew 27% year-over-year to approximately $421 million as a result of significant uptake of our new instruments as well as continued strong demand from MiSeq and HiSeq products. In fact, in the first quarter, we delivered record orders, shipments and revenues driven by record results across more than 15 different metrics including shipments and orders for sequencing instruments and services as well as HiSeq and MiSeq consumables.","Globally demand for our products, remain strong during the first quarter. Shipments in the Americas grew 24% year-over-year and Europe saw 32% increase over the same period last year. In APAC, shipments grew 22% year over year, driven by continued strength in Japan, where Q1 is a traditionally strong quarter which was certainly the case again this year.","Instrument revenue grew 32% year over year to reach $116 million in the first quarter. Growth across the sequencing portfolio was partially offset by a decline in array instruments.","Consumable revenue in the quarter was $243 million, an increase of 18% compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to high demand for sequencing consumables as well as our grown installed base. Consumable revenue represented 58% of total revenues, down from 62% in the prior year period and lower than the 63% seen in Q4, primarily due to the strengthened instrument services and maintenance contracts during the first quarter.","Sequencing consumables grew 32% over Q1 of last year, due to higher instrument utilization and a larger installed base. In Q1 Sample Prep shipments grew 16% year-over-year due to demand for RNA sample prep kit, Nextera XT, our library prep solutions for small genome and record demand for our Nextera Rapid Exome Captured solutions.","HiSeq and MiSeq consumables reached record levels during the first quarter. This translated to HiSeq pull-through for instrument excluding HiSeq X in our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000 down somewhat sequentially as expected given year-end spending during the fourth quarter, the higher year-over-year. We continue to project HiSeq pull-through of $300,000 to $350,000 per instrument.","MiSeq utilization exceeded our internal forecast during the first quarter and as a result pull-through our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000.","In prior calls, as we have discussed the impact of new customers developing assays on MiSeq, resulting an early under-utilization instrument followed by an up-tick in utilization of the assays up into use.","This quarter we started to see the benefit of these activities with more than 30 separate accounts ordering production levels of MiSeq consumables, most of which were clinical accounts performing oncology or HLA assays. This compares to just 13 accounts a year ago.","While this is an indication of MiSeq utilization might trend above our range, given this is the first quarter, we\u2019ve seen this dynamic and we will not be updating the range at this time.","It is too early to provide an estimate of NextSeq or HiSeq pull-through. Historically it takes several quarters for this to normalize as our calculation method tends to over-estimate pull-through in the early quarters of the new instrument ramp.","Services and other revenues, which includes genotyping sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenue from verified sales grew more than 65% versus Q1 2013 to equal $59 million. This improvement was driven by ongoing growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with the larger sequencing installed base and $8 million genotyping services order that was completed and recognized during the first quarter and strengthening other genotyping services and verified sales.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results which exclude legal contingencies, non-cash stock compensation expense, and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today\u2019s earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the first quarter sequenced 70.4% compared to 71.4% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to a lower mix of amounts, as a result of the strengths in CG extending reach. Year-over-year in Q1, gross margins expanded 120 basis points, as a result of improved instrument and service margins.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $65 million, or 15.5% of revenue, approximately flat compared to $66 million or 17% of revenue in the fourth quarter. Additional labor and benefit expenses more than offset by a sequential decrease in costs associated with our new products introductions.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $84 million, or 19.9% of revenue, compared to $86 million, or 22.2% of revenue, in the previous quarter. The slight decline was primarily due to the higher commission and bonus payments earned in Q4, which were partially offset by additional headcount in Q1 and other expenses for our new product launches.","For the first two months of the quarter, we muted our investing in projects and non-critical headcount as we felt it was prudent to manage the business conservatively through our new product transition.","In March however, we began investing in our more normalized and planned rates which will continue through 2014. As a result, we are projecting operating expense to increase sequentially in the second quarter.","Adjusted operating margins were 34.9% compared to 32.3% in the fourth quarter and 33.3% reported in the first quarter of last year, due primarily to impact the higher gross margins and spending discipline.","In the first quarter, we recognized approximately $700,000 of adjusted other income. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30%, lower than expected due to employee stock activity. This compared to 27.5% in the first quarter of last year, which included the full year impact of the 2012 R&D tax credit as well as the quarterly impact of the 2013 R&D tax credit.","Non-GAAP net income was $80 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.53. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $63 million and $0.46, respectively, in the first quarter of 2013.","We reported GAAP net income of $60 million, or $0.40 per diluted share in the first quarter, compared to a net loss of $23 million, or $0.18, per diluted share in the prior-year period, which included a charge of $107 million related to the Syntrix Biosystems litigation.","Current-period results include $6 million recorded in cost of goods to reflect the ongoing royalty on B-Chip sales associated with the Syntrix litigation plus interest.","We generated cash flow from operations of $37 million during the first quarter, lower than previous quarter due to changes in working capital and the impact of tax benefits from stock based compensation.","Excluding the impacts of the tax benefit outflows, which is myriad of an inflow in cash from financing, cash flow from operations would have been approximately $88 million. DSO increased to 63 days compared to 56 days last quarter, as a result of the relative timing of shipments.","Capital expenditures were $19 million resulting in $18 million of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash in short-term investments.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 788,000 shares for $130 million as part of our discretionary repurchase program. We have $238 million remaining under our previously announced program.","Given our strong first quarter results and the strength in demand for HiSeq X Ten, we have updated our guidance for 2014. We now predict revenue growth of 21% to 23%, an increase from the previous guidance of 15% to 17% growth and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.10 to $2.15, higher than our previous guidance of $2 to $2.06. This projection includes shipping materially higher number of HiSeq X Ten than the five we included in the January guidance.","Additional modeling considerations include full-year weighted average, non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of $150 million, which assumes a stock price of $140 and a full year proof on the tax rate of 29.5% which includes the 2014 federal R&D tax credit as yet to be inactive.","If the tax credit and other tax extenders are not passed, our tax rate would have increased by approximately 200 basis points.","In summary, we delivered strong first quarter results and are projecting significant growth throughout the remainder of 2014 and beyond. We continue to drive the market development and adoption in the most innovative and extensive sequencing portfolio available. We remain focused on building our business and our capabilities to address the more than $20 billion market opportunity ahead of us.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question plus a related follow-up if necessary. Operator, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, thanks for taking the question and nice quarter. Just first question on actual genome and onco panels, can we kind of refine your thinking about how you\u2019re going to be bringing these to the market and Jay, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about how you think about the market opportunity, I know you talked about $11 billion ramp on oncology, but how do we think about specifically actionable genome and the onco panel?","Jay Flatley","Still early days Tycho. And in terms of exactly how we\u2019ll bring that to market, I mean, we have these consortia in place and operating now. They are beginning to define the content. We\u2019re working with the regulatory bodies to understand exactly how we would do clinical trials around these products.","They may wind up being more similar, perhaps than we had originally envisioned. So that\u2019s as we define the content going to continue to evolve. Hopefully we\u2019ll have a lot of progress by the end of the year in terms of what the definition of the products would look like and then be in the midst of the development of the content and the assay methods and the regulatory filings in 2015.","In terms of the market size, we think that $11 billion number for oncology overall is a great camp for us to be thinking about. The constraints of the market development as we\u2019ve done our homework on this, we revolve around standards as I mentioned in the script and so we\u2019re trying to move that ball forward as part of this consortium work and getting these through the regulatory bodies so that they\u2019re approved products and so both of those components are going to be key aspects of the programs.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","And then, has the momentum from pharma picked up a bit. I noticed in a way your first X Ten orders was elusive. So, step it up capacity and then also what are the trends like within pharma?","Jay Flatley","Yes, I\u2019d say overall, over the past year but pharma business has been increasing. It\u2019s really for discovery purposes on the one hand. I think there is interest in increasing level for use in clinical trial. But I suspect that won\u2019t be implemented by them actually buying large scale purchases of sequencers into their laboratories but be outsourced to the CROs.","But I think in general, pharma is becoming a larger customer base for us and in particular around Companion Diagnostics, which we believe are going to move increasingly towards sequencing for all the scientific reasons we\u2019ve talked about previously.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","And last one, any update on the population efforts, I think we are supposed to hear something on genoming around this time. Any of these big efforts are going to get funded in the near term?","Jay Flatley","Well, they\u2019re definitely going to get funded. They are continuing to move forward and genoming when this is funded, it\u2019s a question of what their process is select the suppliers and we\u2019re not really disclosing any details around that. But I think in other places around the world there are projects that are in \u2013 I\u2019d call the design phase, and by that I mean talking about specifically how and when to implement them in and we\u2019re quite confident that they\u2019ll be funding behind those as well.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel, Cowen & Company. Please proceed, sir.","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thank you and good afternoon. I know this may seem like silly question given the strength and really the magnitude of the Q1 revenue being relative to consensus expectations. But I am wondering if there was any pause in the typical pattern on instrument demand in the quarter given the breadth of the new product offerings you announced in mid-January. And if so, did you fully recover by the end of the quarter or was there some excess backlog as you had it in Q2?","Jay Flatley","I guess the first thing I\u2019d say Doug is that the order rate in Q1 was extraordinarily strong. I mean, it was quite exceptional. And if there was any pause, it was a matter of weeks at the beginning of the quarter while we did have a backend loaded quarter just because of the inherent strength of the orders in the quarter.","Our January order rate was quite reasonable. So, we couldn\u2019t see anything that concerned us, even earlier in the quarter. Having said that there clearly are some of our customers who are evaluating alternatives about which way to go and that continues even into Q2.","As we mentioned, the cannibalization effects of these new products were significantly less than we might have anticipated. We had models internally about draconian types of cannibalization and were trying to compare for that worst case outcome and enhance our guidance coming into the quarter that we could have flat revenue if that scenario had played out. But the actual cannibalization was much less than we anticipated.","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then, as you guys have pointed out in the past, you usually don\u2019t increase guidance in Q1. Can you provide some detail on what has changed, clearly part of that was the Q1 strength. But I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, would you be willing to talk us through your assumptions for X Ten placements in 2014, thoughts on cannibalization in terms of which factored into guidance and really on the other key assumptions that have changed at the revenue one?","Jay Flatley","I can talk to that in general. I guess the two initial factors are number one, the magnitude of the revenue dealing in Q1. And behind that the strength of the incoming order rate were both key factors for us.","Additionally as I mentioned in this script, as we look forward through the rest of 2014, we\u2019re increasingly confident about our ability to deliver more HiSeq Xs and we\u2019re in the original plan. And that\u2019s because we have now good one side on the cameras. Our production is ramping on the pattern of flow sales, as I mentioned we\u2019re still early in that. So, we don\u2019t know exactly where the yields are going to wind up on those pattern flow cells. But we\u2019re ramping quite quickly now, so that gave us more confidence about that delivery pipeline for the Xs.","In addition, presuming the lack of cannibalization let\u2019s call it that we\u2019ve seen in Q1, if that continues through the rest of the year, I guess our conclusion is that we\u2019ve done a reasonably good job of positioning these new products from a price and a throughput perspective whether largely additive to the overall revenue.","We saw almost no cannibalization of MiSeq, which was quite a surprise to us. We had great strength in the MiSeq product line. We had a little bit of cannibalization in our assumptions, that continues from HiSeq 2500 down to NextSeq, so there are some customers that made that transition but in a couple of cases that we recently ordered multiple NextSeq, so from a revenue perspective that was close to neutral.","So, those were all factors that caused us to update the guidance for the quarter and to \u2013 I think robustly increase the forecast throughout the rest of the year.","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company","Great. And one last one. Some have suggested that there should be some concern about growth prospects due to uncertainty regarding the outlook for reimbursement of cancer panels and\/or exomes. In your opinion, is there any risk to guidance associated with this dynamic? Thanks again.","Jay Flatley","Yes, thanks. No, we don\u2019t think there is. We\u2019ve certainly in our guidance tried to incorporate what we think is happening around the reimbursement front. And we are getting panels reimbursed, we\u2019re getting exomes reimbursed even in some cases whole genomes.","That\u2019s not typical on all of these products. But I think the trend is overall favorable with respect to reimbursement and we\u2019re beginning to work behind the scenes with the payers to beginning to educate them on the trends in next generation sequencing and to build the economic arguments that NGS really is a money saving proposition.","So, overall we\u2019re confident about reimbursement over the next few-year period. And I think if it would go faster than it is now that would be upside to the guidance that we provided.","Rebecca Chambers","Operator, we\u2019re ready for the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Derik De Bruin, Bank of America. Please proceed.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, good afternoon.","Jay Flatley","Hi Derik.","Rebecca Chambers","Derik.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Do you know, can you give me an idea of how many of your customers are using your sample prep and target enrichment products. I\u2019m just getting a sense of how much of that revenue stream you\u2019re capturing and potential upside as you self expand that reach?","Jay Flatley","Yes. Well, I can\u2019t give you exactly the customer numbers. But I think in terms of market share, we in general position our market share somewhere between 20% and 30% of the revenue in sample prep market.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And the population genomics market, I mean, that\u2019s when we\u2019ve sort of struggled with for a number of years, in terms of trying to politicize on that opportunity. I guess, can you sort of help us frame that a little bit more. And then, also have you heard anything out of DGI and sort of what their plans with complete genomics in that and just any update on sort of your relationship with DGI and what help us in responding to the X Ten situation?","Jay Flatley","Population sequencing is a bit hard to put in the forecast because they\u2019re digital large opportunities. And so we haven\u2019t for example put our pen down on some specific number of pop-seek programs for this year.","And I think that in general, there would be X Ten customers and embedded in our upside forecast for X Tens are some number of units for these \u2013 overall pop-seek programs. I can probably give you some indication that \u2013 around the globe they\u2019re probably are in the range of three to five of these that are quite serious.","And probably a list of 10 to 15 of them that are theoretical potential. So it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be 2014 opportunities but over the next couple of years, 10 to 15 that looks quite interesting and potentially real.","With respect to BGI, we don\u2019t have any more clarity than anyone else what their roll-out plans are for \u2013 and use of complete genomics technology. We continue to work with them, they remain a customer. We have not signed a clinical agreement with BGI. And for now, that\u2019s really all the information we have.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Great, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Jay Flatley","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard, Leerink. Please proceed.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink","Thank you. How much of the continued interest in HiSeq in the quarter was driven by the desire of folks without deed of instrument to run the 1T or the version 4-kit as you\u2019re calling it?","Jay Flatley","Implying that there were upgrades from older units to 25.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink","Yes, over placements or whatever the right term is exactly.","Jay Flatley","Not much in the quarter so we didn\u2019t see a lot of that in Q1, we think that there is some potential energy for revenue here over the next year as the 1T kits gets into the market and customers begin to understand the performance of the 1T kits. As I mentioned in the script, we just started shipping those last week. So, I suspect over the next month or so.","Customers will begin to share data on the performance of that 1T kit. We\u2019re very excited about it and our hope is that customers understand the capabilities that they can have in the run parts they can get with the 1T kit that it will begin the catalyze and upgrade cycle.","That upgrade cycle could go as I mentioned in different directions, it could go towards HiSeq 2500 that it might go toward NextSeq or some combination of those instruments. And in some cases you might even get some external results. But in the quarter, I would say little to no impact or upwards.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink","Okay, got it. And then it\u2019s somewhat related, follow-up question. Jay, can you comment at all that the price volume and mix dynamics in the sequencing consumable strength you called out in your prepared remarks?","Jay Flatley","Can you be a little more specific Dan, what are you referring to?","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink","Well, I don\u2019t know if you want to talk to it specifically but I\u2019m wondering if price increases were a big component of the record HiSeq and MiSeq consumables numbers in the quarter?","Jay Flatley","No, the price increase really hasn\u2019t taken affect yet. And unlike other quarters, Q1 is where we\u2019ve had price increases. We didn\u2019t see a significant pre-ordering or pre-stocking in Q1. We saw that over the last two years in anticipation of price increases, customers built up some inventory.","If anything we saw a little bit of a run-down of the inventory out of customers, largely in anticipation of the shipment of the 1T kit. And for that reason and because that kit wasn\u2019t shipping, there wasn\u2019t any frontloading of shipment.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken, ISI Group.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, good afternoon guys and congrats.","Jay Flatley","Thanks Ross.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","I guess on some of the larger scale projects, what has been the feedback both in terms of the ability to kind of acquire the number of samples, needed to satisfy some of these large projects, particularly on the oncology side. And then also just on the bioinformatics side, you guys are doing a lot to sort of simplify and make them more achievable. What have you heard in terms of feedback from the customer base in terms of what the next leg that needs to happen there just to kind of if there is question make some of these more population based studies, more feasible?","Jay Flatley","Yeah, what about our filters that we use on X Ten orders that we take, really does relate to samples. Particularly I would suggest in the Asian market, there is some sets of customers who might buy an X Ten and then actually not use it very extensively. And those in the long run are great customers for us and so we want to make sure we qualify the X Ten placements to be sure there is a pipeline of samples behind it.","In most of the cases of the customers we\u2019re dealing with, there are taps into either the hospital systems or into the health system that gives us reasonable confidence of a sample flow that supports the throughput levels of the X Ten. And that\u2019s certainly true in this first handful of proxy projects that we\u2019re talking about, the U.K. being a great example, being directly tapped into the NHS.","In terms of bioinformatics, that is one of the core challenges I think in the X Ten installations, one different from our original set of assumptions on X Ten is that we thought when we originally talked about five customers, that these would all be very sophisticated customers who would initially buy these products. And that they would have full bioinformatics capability and limbs capability for sample tracking.","And what we found so far is that while there are clearly buyers, there are many other potential buyer who are less sophisticated in terms of sequencing. And so it\u2019s incumbent on us to improving the overall sample support infrastructure around an X Ten and we\u2019re very actively involved in developing that capability to help manage the sample prep and the limbs workflow behind our sample numbers that are required to feed the system.","Additionally with the next bio-capability and what we\u2019re doing in the BaseSpace, appstore. We\u2019re bringing in much more horsepower to actually store and analyze the genomic data, particularly when it\u2019s hooked into the clinical information which we can now store together in the next bio-environment. So, thinking lots of progress there, still a long way to go for us and everyone to improve the informatics side.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","Excellent, thanks Jay. That\u2019s it from me.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy, William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","Hi, thanks. I just had a question on the X Ten if I may. So, now that you\u2019ve got a few orders under your belt and you never take the customers that are placing orders at this point. I\u2019m curious if you have an update on how we should think about the number of customers who might be potential buyers of the X Ten in its current form. And then just thinking beyond that group, what are you guys thinking about potentially opening up the X Ten restrictions at this point?","Jay Flatley","Well, I guess the early products Amanda, has been incredible on this. And we\u2019re thinking to what say 12-month forecast might look like on X Ten. The pipeline is really strong here as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect some additional orders in the second quarter.","I think a core question that\u2019s unanswered for us is how much this initial demand really represents sort of an initial bonus that will slow down or flatten out as a set of initial customers when we get their systems and whether we\u2019re meeting market demands that won\u2019t continue. And we don\u2019t quite know the answer to that yet. Right now, our pipeline looks quite good through maybe the middle of next year.","And by that I mean that the customers have talked to us about getting access to this technology but not have funding until Q1 of \u201815 or Q2 of \u201815, which in some ways is good and that it stretches out the delivery and the order rate for these systems.","So, it\u2019s a little hard for us to actually forecast where this is going to go right now, but we\u2019re cautiously optimistic given the early signs. But with respect to opening up the platform, it\u2019s really too early to think about that. And we\u2019ve obviously done some internal, we\u2019re trying to understand what those market dynamics might look like both in terms of changing from \u2013 a requirement to buy 10 units and also what those applications could run on a HiSeq X.","But we\u2019re at least a year away from considering any serious decisions about opening it up in any way. We\u2019re just waiting to see how this market evolves, what the demand looks like in sort of how the dynamics into sort of inter-related inter-play throughout the rest of this year.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","Got it. Okay, and then just one quick one on the guidance. I\u2019m just curious what your assumptions are around stock based comp and then are you still looking for, I think you said before 70% growth margin for the year, I\u2019m sorry if I missed that, but curious if that was an updated, if you had updated that number as well?","Jay Flatley","Yes, Marc, why don\u2019t you take that one?","Marc Stapley","Yes, happy to. So, Amanda, yes, I mean, you\u2019re right. We gave guidance, updated guidance on revenue and no, actually show how useful it is to give the guidance for the gross margin, stock based compensation. Because even when we do this, there is a pretty broad range of estimates out there, which I think is fine.","I mean, we have our own, until the range of estimates as you can imagine. So really wanting to get people to focus on the top and bottom line really and have some degrees of flexibility around the individual line items that feature within that.","On stock based comp specifically, I think it\u2019s fair to assume that the current quarter rate we kind of flow on a quarterly basis. And if anything it could up-tick as we go on throughout the year.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro, GS. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon guys, thanks. Just a follow-up on the informatics strategy if I may, maybe you guys touched a little bit on the strategy there. Could you talk a little bit more specifically on the operational plan, you guys have opened a facility in Mission Bay, San Francisco last year, you\u2019re building that out. Maybe just an update on how that went this quarter kind of what the operating plan is for the rest of the year specifically around building out the informatics strategy?","Jay Flatley","Well, just to be clear Isaac, the facility in Mission Bay, and the bay area won\u2019t be open until this fall. So we are doing the build-out there but there is no staff in that facility yet. Most of the informatics staff that work on the next bio-part of this are located in Santa Clara, where next bio was going to be suspected.","Most of the people will continue to stay in your South Bay at least for the next year or so. So, we\u2019ll be beginning to hire new informatics talent and it\u2019s going to be Mission Bay facility as we open that up in the fall.","In terms of operational aspects around informatics, we are running next NextBio and BaseSpace in our new enterprise commission business unit headed by Nick Naclerio. We\u2019re focused on the NextBio side in terms of generating revenue from independent sales of NextBio. And these are generally into farmers and large institutional sales, we\u2019re putting a sales force that fits into that business unit. And I think we now have four or five people in that sales activity.","And then of course, we\u2019re coupling NextBio into these large X Ten population sequencing sales because we think it\u2019s a fantastic backend and to the extent that we can integrate NextBio directly into the workflow and pipeline. It greatly simplifies the installation and the implementation and it\u2019s more a tricky solution for our customers. So, you\u2019ll find NextBio, increasingly bundled into those large-scale of sales.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, that\u2019s helpful thanks. And just a follow-up on MiSeq, you touched on the strength you saw there this quarter. But when you put that in that in the context of competitive environment, in the lower end of the market so to speak, really on a global basis, because your primary competitor there obviously trying to get some of the products out the door this year, but under a wing of a bigger distribution channel globally. So, just curious about how you see the MiSeq competitive environment playing out over the balance of the year? Thank you.","Jay Flatley","MiSeq was as I mentioned extremely strong performer in the quarter, part of that was due to the FDA approval both directly, by customer\u2019s ordering the DX version of the product. But I think even more so indirectly from customers who know that there is now an FDA approved platform. And just putting some air under the entire product line is a result of that.","I think the competitive position was greatly enhanced by the price decrease. We got feedback from the field that the $99,000 price point much like the $99 array price point was a year ago sort of a magical place to be. And it just inherently increased the demand getting under $100,000.","From a competitive position we won the vast majority of the head to head competitive situations with customers. In fact we didn\u2019t get any specific reports of lost orders from MiSeq 2 competitors and enhance the overall strength in the numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Groberg, Macquarie. Please proceed.","John Groberg \u2013 Macquarie","Thanks. Jay, I want you to just focus a little bit on the comments around new customers. I think you said if I remember that correctly 70% of your shipments for the new customers. So, I just wanted to maybe ask two questions.","One, if you think about \u2013 you think about from a same-store sales perspective or kind of the existing customers, kind of what rate are they growing at and how do you think about all the new products that you\u2019ve launched and their ability to evaluate the new products and potentially upgrade and maybe how that could change that dynamic?","And then the second point I wanted to explore, was how just how important this accelerator initiative that you\u2019ve announced and launched, is for you as you think about trying to develop new applications and new customers?","Jay Flatley","Yes. I think the key contributor to the high end customer acquisitions, actually might have to do with the 1T kits in a way. Because what we saw in the HiSeq installed base was perhaps fewer HiSeq orders from the existing customers in anticipation of the 1T kit both to see how well it performs on the one hand but also because of the inherent throughput increase.","Not to really say it\u2019s stalled up the market, but I think customers were waiting to see what do they actually get delivered from that 1T kit before they begin ordering incremental HiSeqs to add to their fleet. And so, that probably depressed the order receipt number a little bit from our existing installed base at HiSeqs.","In addition, we didn\u2019t have the \u2013 we have really started the upgrade cycle from the older generation of HiSeqs. And so, I think just on a statistics basis, that meant that most of the HiSeq orders came from new customers.","I think similarly and MiSeq because of the FDA approval, we saw very broad adoption in new clinical sites across the MiSeq platform. I think on NextSeq we had a little bit of the opposite effect because it was very early on that new product most of the orders came from existing customers because they knew the technology, they knew the reputation of Illumina.","But if you look forward in the pipeline most of the forward going pipeline of MiSeq for new customers begin to educate this new target based on what that technology is and what it can do.","With respect to the accelerator, this is strategically quite important for us. We plan this year to fund three companies in the accelerator, we\u2019re a process of retrieving proposals now. And the purpose of course is for us to capitalize new companies that can develop great applications across NGS.","And so, we\u2019re co-investing here with Yuri Milner, funding them over relatively short time frame. And they\u2019re either kicking them out as brand new companies that will be self sustaining or if they\u2019re not successful what they\u2019re trying to do closing them down. So I think we\u2019ll be very excited to see what the success will be initial set of companies is and hopefully if it works the way we hope, we\u2019ll be able to grow the program into 2015 and beyond.","John Groberg \u2013 Macquarie","Okay, thanks a lot. And can I ask just one quick one for Marc, on the cash flow, on the receivables is that all due to timing, is that what you said, I just wanted to make sure on the cash flow?","Marc Stapley","Yes, John, you\u2019re referencing the up-tick in the DSO.","John Groberg \u2013 Macquarie","Yes.","Marc Stapley","Yes, that was I mean, it\u2019s a timing of shipments in the quarter and when we expect to collect that which clearly goes into the second quarter.","John Groberg \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. But as you\u2019re expanding all these new customers, you\u2019re bad debt, anything isn\u2019t increasing?","Marc Stapley","No, not until \u2013 no change in the dynamic there at all.","John Groberg \u2013 Macquarie","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk, Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Bill Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Great, thanks guys. Good morning. First question, say first question is just \u2013 I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on the interest level for the NextSeq and specifically I guess around the current customer list, not surprised that you have quite a bit of non-academic interest, is that \u2013 can I guess I thought money has been a little bit higher. So, maybe you can just talk to kind of what you\u2019re seeing and maybe how this might transition? Thanks.","Jay Flatley","Yes. I think I guess yes, the platform has been incredible. What we saw in actual order receipts is probably new did a little bit by the fact that we had this two-channel chemistry versus four-channel chemistry. And it took a while for customers to actually believe that the chemistry performed as well as our fortunate chemistry does. That I think questions about that were raised once customers began getting them into their sites, getting them up and running and actually beginning to share the dataset.","So the data that\u2019s coming out from the initial set of customers, I think on critically says that the data quality is as good as our four-channel chemistry. And so I think that\u2019s really in the latter part of the quarter capitalize the actual order rate that \u2013 the orders that crossed the finish line into the quarter.","But pipeline is extremely strong for NextSeq, and I think it will while Q1 was focused lot on existing customers for reasons I just talked about. I think going forward, it will be driven by a higher percentage of new customers because of the flexibility it provides and collides having in particular, it\u2019s a perfect instrument for that kind of customer.","Bill Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Got it. And as, well, I\u2019ll stretch the call to follow-up to that question, but can you talk at all to some of the rumors as market speculation around kidding the verified stuff?","Jay Flatley","Well, I don\u2019t know what the rumors are, maybe we\u2019ve talked specifically about the fact that we\u2019re going to submit that into the FDA. So that\u2019s probably information and we\u2019re going to get that submitted by the end of the year, that\u2019s our target.","Bill Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Perfect. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Ervin, Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","Tim Ervin \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks. I was wondering Marc that you might be willing to comment on your longer term guidance and specifically the component of that in which you want to grow EPS faster than revenue. Is that still achievable given where your markings are now and kind of the dynamics around the share count?","And then maybe Jay, if you could also maybe comment on the longer term outlook for the array market?","Marc Stapley","Tim, yes, I\u2019m happy to comment on that. I mean, no real change in our longer term guidance either the top line, due that we have there the fact that we would expect, it\u2019s more of a goal I would say than I think that we expect to provide leverage over that longer term period.","Of course the other thing, in the current results that would \u2013 that cause us to think about that very definitely impact on the contrary I would think. It\u2019s the dynamics that we have and the opportunities that we have are pretty much the same as they were previously and I wouldn\u2019t change that at this point.","Jay Flatley","Yes, and the array market. If the market, where we have some offsetting factors at work. On the upside of the array market, we have growing strength in the IBF opportunity, the Ag business continues to do well. We remain bullish about what\u2019s going to happen in the consumer markets using arrays here over the next couple of years. And we\u2019re continuing to see, remaining elasticity there as the prices come down.","Now, that\u2019s offset of course by the fact that the traditional G-Los market I think is moving much more towards sequencing as is the expression market moving toward RNASeq. And so those are downward forces on and the overall array business.","So, in our internal forecast range from down, in low single digits to up low single digits. And it will probably bounce around within that range quarter to quarter.","Tim Ervin \u2013 Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliot, Robert W Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff Elliot \u2013 Robert W Baird","Thanks guys and great quarter. Jay, first question is for you. Can you give us an update on molecular or any of the other long-read programs?","Jay Flatley","Yes, the molecular is in late stage development now. We expect to begin shipping that product late in Q2. We are continuing to work internally on enhancement of long-read options and so we have a couple of other development programs that are early in research right now but very promising we think in the long-run. And those would be complimentary to what we\u2019re doing molecular.","Jeff Elliot \u2013 Robert W Baird","Great. And Marc, could you clarify, could you say any weather impact in the quarter, I know you had strong consumables numbers, but was there any weather impact in the U.S.?","Marc Stapley","No really, there wasn\u2019t. And there really isn\u2019t for our business, it\u2019s not something that has a material impact on our revenue. So, I wouldn\u2019t comment on that, nothing there.","Jeff Elliot \u2013 Robert W Baird","Great. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we don\u2019t have any additional questions.

I\u2019m very pleased to report that Q3 was another outstanding quarter for Illumina and arguably our most impressive quarterly performance to-date. Revenue increased 35% year-over-year to $481 million, our highest year-over-year growth rate since Q2 2011 and the 12th quarter of sequential revenue growth.","Equally impressive was the leverage we delivered this quarter, as non-GAAP earnings per share grew 71% compared to the third quarter of 2013. These record results were due to strong underlying trends across our sequencing portfolio in almost all geographies, as well as strong operational execution and a favorable tax rate.","Third quarter total sequencing revenue grew 47% year-over-year driven by record sequencing consumables, continued placements of our new instruments and growth in NIPT testing. These results demonstrate the value of the most extensive sequencing portfolio available as we continue to experience a robust uptake of our products across markets, experimental scales and applications.","Sequencing instrument revenue grew 55% compared to the third quarter of 2013 fueled by demand by HiSeq X Ten and the NextSeq 500. In addition, HiSeq and MiSeq demand remains strong highlighting those instruments position as the NGS gold standard in their respective segments.","Markets strength continued for the HiSeq family of products including HiSeq X even compared to Q3 of last year when we shipped 100 HiSeqs. Shipments were higher both sequentially and year-over-year and ASPs improved due to mix shifting towards the higher priced models.","We continue to be very pleased with the level of interest in HiSeq X Ten as demand remains well above our original assumptions. In total, Q3 saw four HiSeq X Ten orders, two of which we shared with you on the last earnings call. We now have 15 customers who have ordered a total of 164 systems since the product launch in January.","Included in these figures are new orders from DKFZ, a cancer research center in Germany, who will be offering whole-genome sequencing for cancer patients, as well as SciLifeLab in Sweden, who will be participating in the Swedish National Sequencing Project.","As mentioned on the last call, we have sufficient manufacturing capacity for HiSeq X instruments and the patterned flow cells to meet demand. As a result, the quarterly shipment rate is now largely determined by our customers\u2019 readiness to absorb and utilize systems.","During the third quarter, our unit shipments continued to ramp and we\u2019re now working with these sites to validate and integrate the systems into their work flows. Looking forward to Q4, we're forecasting shipment of noticeably fewer Xs based on our current estimate of customer readiness.","It should be noted however that we have a substantial backlog of instruments and a strong funnel of opportunities which we believe will sustain shipments of this configuration of HiSeq Xs through mid 2015.","Demand for HiSeq 2500 benefited from new-to-HiSeq customers, which accounted for 40% of the instruments ordered, as well as existing laboratories looking to upgrade their fleet from earlier generation machines.","During the quarter we received 8 multi-unit orders at least half of which came from customers looking to refresh their fleet with one terabase or 1T enabled instruments. This is the second quarter where we've seen evidence of an upgrade cycle and we expect this trend to continue over the next year or two as customers with older generation HiSeqs evaluate upgraded options appropriate for their applications, work flow and economics.","HiSeq 2500 remains an integral part of our portfolio with a rich roadmap ahead including the recently announced rapid v2 Reagent Kit that delivers 2x250 base pair paired-end reads and up to 300G of data in 60 hours. These longer reads will enhance studies in a number of fields including cancer, microbial genomics and agriculture.","Additionally, the kits will provide researchers with the ability to more accurately identify gene fusions and tackle more complex metagenomics, and de novo assembly projects.","Moving to NextSeq, the rollout continues to go incredibly well with order receipts growing sequentially each quarter since launch including 15% growth in Q3. We now have more than 350 NextSeqs placed globally.","We've also seen an increase in new to Illumina sequencing customers as a result of adding NextSeq to our portfolio accounting for more than 30% of the orders during the quarter. NextSeq also continues to generate significant interest from the commercial segment which accounted for third of orders. These labs are focused on oncology, NIPT and microbiology and are choosing NextSeq due to the breadth of applications, the flexibility of the work flow and the attractive cost per base.","Many of these customers are exploring or implementing NextSeq in translational or clinical production settings, boding well for future consumable utilization.","Overall response to NextSeq continues to be very favorable as evidenced by the number of repeat customers seen in the third quarter. This is due in part to the exceptional performance of the instrument in the field which will be further bolstered by the v2 chemistry we just introduced at the American Society of Human Genetics meeting currently underway here in San Diego.","Including in the v2 release are new die sets and improved cluster chemistry, both of which boost the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby improving accuracy and bringing the instrument up to the standard of our flagship HiSeq platform.","With the availability of the v2 chemistry in early 2015 and other enhancements made since launch, the rate of data quality improvement of NextSeq has greatly exceeded any instrument that we previously brought to market.","We continue to be pleased with the roll out of this platform and expect sequential shipment growth through next year.","Demand for MiSeq continues to outperform our expectations and there\u2019s little evidence if the cannibalization we first anticipated. Orders grew year-over-year as new-to-sequencing customers see the price point, ease-of-use and ability to perform long reads as points of differentiation.","Again, this quarter we saw large multi unit orders from the CDC, public health labs and the FDA, demonstrating the importance of MiSeq as an applied markets tool for pathogen detection, food borne diseases and toxicological events.","Order dynamics are largely unchanged from the trends we've seen in prior quarters with approximately two-thirds of the instruments coming from government, commercial, translational and clinical laboratories and close to 70% of orders from new customers to MiSeq.","Our strong competitive position has resulted in installed base of over 3,000 instruments and we continue to expect MiSeq to be the choice for applied markets as well clinical and translational users.","Moving now to arrays, this quarter total micro array revenue declined approximately 2% year-over-year which was better than our forecast. Growth in genotyping services, and IVF was offset by a decline in our Infinium genotyping business.","Importantly, the Infinium business declined less than prior quarters due to demand from agriculture customers purchasing our iSelect and our Bovine arrays.","During the quarter, array sales to Ag customers grew 26% year-over-year and we continue to project strong interest from this segment. Additionally we had particular success with new opportunities as we won two biobanking and two large consortia deals which have improved our outlook for this market over the next year.","We now expect arrays to be down mid teens in Q4 due to a difficult quarterly comparison resulting in low-to-mid single digit decline for the full year. Beyond 2014, we\u2019re projecting the array business to be approximately flat.","We remain focused on enabling new markets by delivering complete sample to answer workflows. This strategy includes sample prep solutions such as our new library pre kits in NeoPrep, our sample to answer HLA and MiSeq forensic products launching in the coming months and bioinformatics solutions from BaseSpace and NextBio.","With regard to NeoPrep, we continue to perform extensive testing and performance validation. As we just highlighted at ASHG, our team is consistently generating high quality libraries from low DNA input and we\u2019re now focused on assay optimization, reliability and manufacturing readiness.","Meeting our rigorous targets is requiring more time than we originally expected and as a result, we will begin data testing shortly with four commercialization expected in spring of 2015.","As part of our strategy, we continue to enhance our bioinformatics capabilities. BaseSpace now has a total of 50 apps already meeting the year-end goal we set at the beginning of the year.","This quarter in partnership with AB SCIEX we added a suite of apps to the BaseSpace store called the SWATH Proteomics Cloud Tool Kit. These apps make BaseSpace a single storage and processing location for genomic and proteomic data to simplify biomarker discovery and aid research into diseases such as cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer's and heart disease.","Additionally we improved our ability to ingest data into our automated pipeline by a factor of eight, which has led to increased interest from enterprise level customers with large data sets.","As a result, during the quarter we won two new accounts, one from biotechnology company and the other a cancer center. Overall our market opportunity has continued to broaden as demonstrated by commercial non-profit and hospital customers accounting for approximately 55% of shipments.","This quarter we made great progress on our strategy to enable clinical markets. For example, sales of our product and service portfolio to oncology and reproductive health customers, accounted for approximately 40% of total dollar growth in the third quarter compared to the prior year period.","During the quarter, we formally announced the Actionable Genome Consortium with major cancer centers, Illumina and the [Board] (ph) as founding members. The consortium has developed a set of standards that we expect to be published early next year and we're hard at work on a product that we believe will meet those standards.","Additionally, we announced strategic partnerships with AstraZeneca, Janssen, and Sanofi to develop a universal NGS-based oncology test system. This system will be used for clinical trials of targeted cancer therapies with a goal of developing and commercializing a multi gene panel for therapeutic selection. We hope to share additional partners with you in the coming quarters.","An important component of our clinical strategy has been focused on strengthening our regulatory expertise since the acquisition of Myraqa. This team has already had great impact on the organization.","With the addition of Maya and her team, we've greatly enhanced our regulatory and quality leadership and are now focused on an assessment of our entire regulatory strategy which we expect to be concluded in the coming months. We look forward to sharing the results of this work over the next several quarters.","Moving now to reproductive and genetic health, the market continues to develop on a global scale. The launch of the VeriSeq PGS solution for MiSeq has been well received and led to the sales of 10 MiSeq systems this quarter to new to sequencing customers. We plan to launch VeriSeq for use on NextSeq by year end.","In NIPT interest in send out testing grew nicely in the quarter which led in part to 70% sequential growth in sample succession in record revenue.","Additionally our agreement with Berry Genomics to co-develop a cost effective, easy-to-use assay for NIPT in China continues to progress well and we expect the CFDA to approve Berry's submission in the coming quarters.","In summary, our Q3 results exceeded our elevated expectations. With the most powerful and well positioned sequencing portfolio available, we\u2019re witnessing a robust uptick of our products and expansion into new markets.","Our focus on research, development and overall innovation is stronger than ever and looking ahead we expect to deliver a significant growth as we unlock the power of the genome.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our third quarter results.","Marc Stapley","Thanks, Jay. As Jay described, Q3 was another remarkably strong quarter for Illumina. Revenue grew 35% year-over-year to approximately $481 million as a result of momentum across our entire sequencing portfolio, including record sequencing consumable shipments, significant demand for our HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq instruments, and stable demand from MiSeq and the HiSeq 2500.","Global interest in our products remained strong during the third quarter. Shipments in the Americas grew 37% year-over-year due in part to year end spending by customers at the NIH and other federal institutes.","In APAC, shipments grew approximately 27% year-over-year, as strength in China was partially offset by a decline in Japan due to delays in funding disbursements which we expect to be remitted in early 2015.","Europe was particularly impressive in Q3, which is traditionally a slower quarter in the region as we saw 40% increase over the same period last year due to strength in HiSeq X Ten and the rest of our sequencing instrument portfolio.","Instrument revenue grew 51% this year to reach $150 million in the third quarter due to strong NextSeq placements, stable MiSeq and HiSeq sales and our record number of HiSeq X shipments.","Consumable revenue in the quarter was $261 million, an increase of 21% compared to the same quarter last year. High demand for sequencing consumables was partially offset by a decline in arrays. Consumable revenue represented 54% of total revenue, which is down from 60% in the prior year period and slightly lower than the 55% we saw in Q2, due to the strengthen in sequencing instruments and maintenance contracts during the third quarter.","For the remainder of 2014 and through 2015, we expect consumables as a percentage of revenue to continue to be around this level.","Sequencing consumable revenue was approximately $200 million, an increase of 36% over Q3 of last year, due to our larger installed base of instruments including the addition of HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq.","Across our sequencing portfolio, consumables reached record levels during the third quarter. Shipments of our sample prep products grew 35% compared to the prior year due to strong interest in our Nextera and TruSight-targeted families of library prep products as well as our stranded mRNA and total RNA kits.","MiSeq consumable pull-through remains within our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000. For the third consecutive quarter, the number of customers running up full production levels increased, the vast majority of which are oncology, HLA and microbiology accounts.","HiSeq pull-through for instrument excluding HiSeq X was comfortably in our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000 and higher sequentially despite the vacation impact typically seen in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter we are projecting similar utilization levels.","It is still too early to provide guidance from NextSeq or HiSeq X pull-through. However, we are seeing evidence that our early estimates to utilization maybe close. NextSeq utilization is trending towards our expectations and HiSeq X utilization is currently averaging around 50% of theoretical maximum. We hope to share formal pull-through estimates in early 2015.","Services and other revenue which includes genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenue from NIPT services, grew close to 70% versus Q3 2013 to $64 million. This improvement was driven by growth in NIPT services which benefited from test fees as well as increased [verified] [Ph] revenue; ongoing growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with our larger sequencing installed base, and strength in genotyping services which was driven by strong demand from a genealogy customer.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results which exclude legal contingencies, non-cash stock compensation expense, and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today\u2019s earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter equaled 73.2% compared to 70.9% in the second quarter, as a result of improved overhead absorption associated with higher production and improved service margin.","Year-over-year, gross margin expanded 300 basis points, as the impact of the low mix of consumables was more than offset by improved instrument margins as well as higher fixed cost absorption. We have grown into our investments in manufacturing and service facilities and are seeing meaningful leverage as a result.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $70 million, or 14.6% of revenue, compared to $70 million or 15.6% of revenue in the second quarter. While R&D expense was flat sequentially, we expect to continue to incrementally invest in R&D in Q4.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $91 million, or 19% of revenue, compared to $92 million, or 20.5% of revenue, in the previous quarter. The marginal decreases attributed to capitalization of expenses associated with our global business process program and lower outside services spending.","Adjusted operating margins were 39.7% compared to 34.8% in the second quarter and 32.4% reported in the third quarter of last year. Operating margins were higher year-over-year due to the impact of improved gross margins and operating expense leverage.","In the third quarter we recognized approximately $1.6 million of adjusted other expense primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. During the quarter our stock-based compensation expense increased to $45 million compared to $36 million in Q2 as a result of additional accrued expense for our performance stock units.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.3% compared to 29.4% in the third quarter of last year, as a result of the reversal of reserves related to prior year returns. Excluding the impact of these items, the key three non-GAAP tax rate would have equaled 31.6% which does not include the benefit of the R&D tax credit and other tax extenders.","Non-GAAP net income was $140 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.77. Excluding the discrete tax benefits mentioned previously, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.67. This compares the non-GAAP net income and EPS of $63 million and $0.45 respectively in the third quarter of 2013.","We reported GAAP net income of $93 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the third quarter, compared to net income of $31 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior year period.","Current-period results include $5 million recorded in cost of goods to reflect the ongoing royalty on B-Chip sales associated with the Syntrix litigation including interest. Additionally we recorded $7 million in operating expense associated with the settlement of a legal dispute.","We generated cash flow from operations of $146 million during the third quarter, slightly lower than the previous quarter due to an increase in working capital. DSO decreased to a record 52 days compared to 53 days last quarter, as a result of more linear shipments throughout Q3 and our collection efforts.","Inventory increased $22 million sequentially driven by raw materials and working process to support our Q4 forecast.","Capital expenditures were $29 million resulting in $117 million of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Given our record results we have updated our guidance for 2014. We now project revenue growth of approximately 30% year-over-year compared to the previous guidance of 25% to 26% growth. This revenue guidance takes into account lower HiSeq X shipments as Jay previously mentioned, weakness in Japan funding, and a slight foreign exchange headwind.","We are expecting non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $2.63 to $2.65 higher than our prior guidance of $2.26 to $2.28.","Modeling considerations include full-year weighted average, non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of $129 million, and a full year pro forma tax rate of 26% which takes into account the impact of the 2014 federal R&D tax credit and other tax extenders that have yet to be enacted.","If the tax credit and other extenders are not passed, our annual tax rate would increase by approximately 200 basis points.","Excluding the impact of discrete items in Q3 2014 previously mentioned, a more normalized tax rate for the year is 29%, slightly better than our prediction coming into the year due to employee stock activity resulting in higher deductions.","In summary, we delivered remarkable third quarter results including 35% revenue growth and 71% growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share compared to the prior year. The leverage in the second half that we predicted coming into this year is even greater than we anticipated, due to a combination of expended instrument margin, strong overhead absorption, our focus on cogs and operating expense leverage.","We are committed to continue to deliver new products, to segment our technology leadership and enable us to address the more than 20 billion market opportunity ahead of us. Our results so far this year position us even better to do so.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question plus a related follow-up if necessary keeping it to two questions the most. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Thanks, nice quarter guys. Just kicking it off on the reagent kits, can you maybe just help us put it in context as to how you think about that opportunity, just about driving some customers to upgrade older HiSeqs, or is it better pricing capture, or opening up new segments as you alluded to in microbial? Just how do we think about the importance of those announcements in the grand scheme of things?","Jay Flatley","Well there were several of them, three that we announced. Certainly the Long-Read kits will help address on the margin a couple of applications, they are little more challenging to do a Shorter-Reads so the 2x250 kits will help on some of the microbial applications in metagenomics. So that's our market expansion capability.","The additional kit that we launched for HiSeq X allows the systems to run PCR free, so it opens up additional sample prep methods. And those are important, because the PCR free methodology has less bias.","So we\u2019re bringing that capability forward to the X customers as well as some improved coverage for the standard preps as well. So it improves in particularly [EC] [ph] rich regions - improves the overall coverage and flattens the curve there.","And then the third thing we announced we're not yet shipping and that's v2 Reagent for NextSeq which will begin shipping in the first quarter. And that\u2019s an overall quality improvement to what we are doing on NextSeq and we\u2019ve been working on this for some time of course but it wasn\u2019t ready to release this version of the kit when we first started shipping the instrument but it will overall take the quality of the NextSeq data up to what we get on our best HiSeq instrument.","So it is an overall second generation Reagent Kit for NextSeq. So market extension again.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay, and then follow-up question on NIPT, you did have one customer announce they were moving over to arrays. Can you maybe just talk about risks of other following that path? And secondarily, talk about next steps for you in NIPT, and any color on time lines for the average risk submission?","Jay Flatley","We as you might imagine have done a very close evaluation of how well you can run NIPT on arrays and we are convinced that you can\u2019t achieve the same quality with arrays that you can get on sequencing..","That particular customer that did shift over was a very minor revenue customer for us. So we don\u2019t think it will have any significant impact on our overall revenue forecast.","With respect to average risk, we are seeing some leakage of the test into average risk markets already. That clearly is happening largely in the U.S. and probably will start happening in China as well once we get CFDA approval there.","So that\u2019s growing the market. And as we\u2019ve spoken before, we are working on additional publications and clinical studies to support the average risk version of the test. We've published our first one. We believe a couple of other of our customers who are working in this area have studies that they are going to publish as well and those collectively will help just get into practice guidelines and ultimately reimbursed.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. But no comment on time lines for your own submission on average risk?","Jay Flatley","No comment at the moment.","Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Please proceed.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Good afternoon guys and congrats on a good quarter. So, I guess my first question is on margins; you generated incremental operating margin of just under 50% this quarter, which is well above the incremental margin generated in the first half, which I think was closer to 30%. There wasn't a huge change in the trajectory of spending. The upside here is largely a function of the stronger than expected revenue growth.","And your guidance for the year seems to imply that you expect similarly robust incremental in the fourth quarter. So I'm just wondering over the next few quarters, how should we think about this? Should we expect a pull-forward of investment on a higher revenue growth and new programs? Or are you comfortable with this type of margin improvement as we think ahead?","Marc Stapley","Yeah Doug, it's Marc. So a couple of things I mean you are right, to point that out. The revenue growth obviously came a lot faster than any investments we\u2019ve made in the quarter but some of the benefits you saw in leverage sustainable for example, some of the benefits in gross margin like the improved absorption that we've seen in the quarter and our focus on cost of goods sold.","We had a program for sometime to focus on elements in there. As well as of course discounting and you get the benefit of the incremental margins on the new instruments like HiSeq X and NextSeq that we talked about previously.","So those would be somewhat sustainable, of course as we move into the future and we invest in manufacturing of service capabilities, you get a step function impact there until you grow into those facilities as we have done largely with what we have today.","And on the operating expense side I\u2019d say, while we were flat sequentially in R&D for example we do expect as I mentioned in prepared remarks to invest in R&D going forward in the fourth quarter and also in SG&A, we have seen some benefit of capitalization of some of our cost related to our global business performance program this quarter and that goes across the geography of the P&L.","But you're right, if you look at the guidance for the rest of the year and therefore for Q4, we do continue to see some leverage not as much as in the third quarter but certainly some and it\u2019s a little early to talk about 2015 at this point.","Jay Flatley","I would add Doug that, as it becomes clear that we're exceeding our revenue by the scale of this beat at least, we begin to release incremental headcounts that's over the budget and that's obviously to support the field activities associated with a higher revenue and also to continue to invest in additional R&D programs.","But I might say that, we're not for example tackling some major new program just because we\u2019ve had this revenue beat. So it's incremental additions to R&D and sales and marketing, not sort of wholesale additions for brand new programs.","Francis, do you want to comment on the instrument margins in conjunction with Marc's?","Francis deSouza","Sure. As Marc touched on, one of the things that is driving better operating margin and gross margin is the mix in instrument. So specifically as the X and NextSeq becomes a bigger part of our sales in a given quarter, those instruments were designed from the ground up to be higher margin instruments.","And so that delivers some of the leverage you\u2019re seeing and actually we\u2019re seeing them perform even better than we had planned already.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Great. That's really helpful. And for my second question I'm sure there's going to be a lot of questions on X Ten, so I actually want to ask a question about the 2500. Keeping in mind 2013 was a really strong year for the pre X Ten HiSeq line, the quarterly pace of placements slowed a bit in the first half of this year; this is probably in large part due to tough comps and likely some cannibalization or pausing due to the X Ten and NextSeq launches.","Sounds like things got a little bit better this quarter. I'd argue you sounded as good in describing the 2500s as you have all year. You talked about multiple instrument orders, some evidence of a replacement cycle. Are you feeling a little bit better for the outlook for reacceleration in HiSeq instruments revenue growth?","Jay Flatley","Well I guess I wouldn\u2019t describe it as better because we never felt bad about it to start with. And I guess I would call HiSeq sort of in the stable range. I mean it bounces around a bit quarter-to-quarter but kind of in the similar range of shipments as we saw on the beginning of the year.","And we feel really good about the new chemistry we are bringing forward on HiSeq and the multi unit orders were fantastic. The new customers coming in to that platform continue to be impressive.","So it's got a long life and it\u2019s a great product line for us so it will continue for long time.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America","Hi good afternoon. So it's nice to see the array business improve. Did I hear you say flat in 2015? And also could you talk about the bio-bank win from the size of these projects? And also just about the ag bio. I have been reading the literature. It just seems like there's some big bovine projects that are gearing up, and just a little bit more color on how you are thinking about the business?","Jay Flatley","On the Ag projects there are quite a few of these around the globe that are of real size and obviously we are being very active in those, they are competitive. But we are feeling really positive about it.","We did say that we expect the business to be approximately flat next year, little hard to predict that down to the specific percentages but I think to a first approximation, we think it will be flat.","We think the biobanking business is going to be - have some resurgence here over the next couple of years and they tend to be projects of reasonably big sizes 10,000 to upwards of 100,000 samples.","Having said that, these projects tend to be use arrays of relatively low complexity. So the price per array continues to fall in the marketplace. So that offsets the number of samples by lower pricing.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America","Great. And just a general follow-up, I had a lot of questions from investors about the potential implication of the FDA's plan to LDT regulation, and is this changing how your customers are thinking about how they're going to deliver products and how they build out their CLIA labs? Could you give us some feedback from what you're hearing from customers in terms of how they are looking at the new landscape going forward?","Jay Flatley","Well I think it depends on what type of test the customers are running. So the ones that are in the long range program of the lower risk test, those customers had many years to adopt and adapt their method. And so I think sort of postponing any decisions about what they do.","The ones that are in the higher risk categories, I think are evaluating what the probability is that the FDA would come in and require them to register their test because we don\u2019t have any final guidance. I think anybody has made complete decisions here but everybody is evaluating their options.","I think overall for Illumina its probably a positive \u2013 somewhat positive development for our business overall because we have the ability to take products through the FDA particularly if they're sequencing based on our platform and we can partner with many companies who decide either for competitive reasons or for regulatory reasons that they want to get their test registered and cleared to the FDA, we can help with that.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of ISI Group. Please proceed.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","Good afternoon. It seems on the oncology side, particularly in pharma you're starting to make some real inroads, you've announced some partnerships. Historically, when we've seen some of these more key announcements, it's led to a lot more discussions with those who are maybe slower to get to the at least press release line. Maybe can you just give a little more color about what the market reaction is, particularly in that space through some of your efforts and some of the things that have now obviously been brought to market, and where the discussions are going also with the existing players, and the sorts of things they're contemplating using sequencing for as they adapt it into their clinical trial process?","Jay Flatley","I guess I'd say Ross, there's a spectrum of responses. We've announced three so far, we have a quite good pipeline of others that we think we have the prospects of closing here over the next two to four quarters we will join this.","There are some who are going to take a wait-and-see position and you might guess who those are. And then there's a couple for a reason you might imagine who aren\u2019t going to work with Illumina, one in particular, and we\u2019ve tried to work with some of those subsidiaries of that company. And I think we\u2019re going to continue to try to see if we have any success there, but that one is probably less likely than the others.","I think that most of these companies will place multiple bets in this area. So, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see competitive announcements. And it will depend on the company\u2019s ability to deliver these products and how well they work particularly around issues like low input sample, the ability to deal with FFPE, the critical considerations for dealing with samples in the oncology market. And we\u2019re very confident about our ability to deliver a great product here and Tina and her group are very hard at work putting that product together.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","Thanks. And maybe on the BaseSpace side it seems like you continue to make this a focus, you made some progress, there's been some announcements there as well. Can you talk to the evolution of that business model and the pushes and pulls on what has been the key elements of that becoming a larger percentage of the P&L? I know it's obviously important to the overall workflow.","Jay Flatley","We still don\u2019t think of it as a major contributor at the P&L line, at least not yet. It\u2019s in an investment mode, we\u2019re continuing to build out the infrastructure of BaseSpace, adding applications in the app store, I mentioned in my script that we\u2019ve now have 50 applications and we\u2019re continuing to push to get lots, lots more.","I think particularly interesting this quarter was the proteomic applications that we added in partnership with AB SCIEX and this is interesting because it\u2019s a different data type than we produce.","So, it begins to demonstrate the ability of BaseSpace to work across data types and housing this data all in one place gives you tremendous power to do translational types of analysis across these various applications.","So, I think that\u2019s a very positive development. We\u2019re integrating it more and more tightly with NextBio. So, I think that will be an important addition to the overall architecture. But, I guess in the next year or two, we wouldn\u2019t think about it as a large revenue contributor.","Ross Muken - ISI Group","Fair enough, congratulations again guys. Tremendous execution.","Jay Flatley","Thanks Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Dan Arias - Citigroup","Hi. Thanks and good afternoon. Jay, you have been pretty clear about making sure you scale properly. So, on manufacturing and leaving aside the X Ten dynamics, anything that you're finding you have to do differently or pivot on, so to speak, in terms of production in order to accommodate the way that the system orders are coming in through the three platforms?","Jay Flatley","Not really anything structural, I mean, we\u2019re continuing to add space in particular locations where we're focused on manufacturing the newer instruments, Singapore being one of those, we're expanding in Singapore because we make NextSeq there, its our first instrument launch out of Singapore.","What else, not really much change here in San Diego we are relocating our reagent manufacturing which is in the facility couple of miles away from our main campus here, on to our campus, so that will take about 18 months to complete. But that\u2019s under way, but that\u2019s not really idea of structural change, it\u2019s really just convenience of having the rest of those people closer to the development teams and the rest of the employees on site.","Francis, do you have anything?","Francis deSouza","I think exactly along the lines that you talked about it, it\u2019s a set of things that are on continuous improvement. Another thing we\u2019re doing for example is, we\u2019re expanding our logistics partnership to improve operations here in the Americas, it\u2019s sort of a core element of our scaling and you\u2019ll see us expand that relationship in the coming quarters for example.","Dan Arias - Citigroup","Okay, that's great. Wanted to ask about the Genomics England contract, have the revenue expectations that you guys have given for that project include the clinical interpretation services that you are in running for, or if you were to be chosen there, would that be added into what you've talk to previously?","Jay Flatley","That would be incremental. So, as \u2013 I am sure you saw there were 10 companies that have made it to the next round, the revenue that we mentioned in our press release was related simply to the sequencing services.","Dan Arias - Citigroup","Yeah, okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Please proceed.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Partners","Thank you. Can you talk about the visibility you have into your X Ten customers' readiness for samples, since that is the gating factor for further X Ten shipments?","Jay Flatley","Yeah, visibility is actually fantastic because we\u2019re in each of these sites pretty much everyday working with these customers, making sure they\u2019re bringing up their sample pipelines and ensuring that the instruments are running well.","So, we know exactly where they are pretty much on a week-to-week basis. And even if customers want to take units \u2013 in general, we don\u2019t want them to be installed and sit idle for weeks at a time. And so we tend to meter them out in sort of as we said proportional to the customers ability to use those instruments.","We also are working hard on, as we mentioned previously, some improvements in software to wrap around these systems to make them easier to use. Originally when we launched the HiSeq X Ten, we thought it was going to go largely into large scale centers that knew how to sequence really well and already had a complete infrastructure.","And as we\u2019ve described, that\u2019s not universally the case. And as a result of that, we\u2019re working on improvements in the software that will help the less experienced customers get up to speed faster and allow the ramp to increase and improve.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Partners","Thank you. And then for my follow-up question Jay, do you have any visibility into the NextSeq order book that you're able to talk about, or is that more of a book and ship type of business with little visibility?","Jay Flatley","Well, I think we have about the same visibility on NextSeq as we do on MiSeq or HiSeq, we tend to manage our pipeline out about nine months and we have a sales force tracking tool, salesforce.com that we use, that looks at opportunities and manages them through a very reasonably predictable funnel. And I guess our close rate on NextSeq has mirrored what we have experienced on the other products.","So, if we see an opportunity, a collection opportunities out seven months from now are statistics on how likely they are to close in any given window is roughly the same as across our other instruments.","So, I\u2019d say the visibility is about equivalent to what we have on MiSeq and HiSeq.","Dan Leonard - Leerink Partners","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy, William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Hey, thanks. I had a follow-up question to Doug's earlier question on the HiSeq. So it sounds like you are getting some traction in terms of a replacement cycle. I'm curious, is it just a function of time at this point, or is it that maybe you need to give the market a bit more in terms of throughput and performance to try and continue to further that upgrade cycle?","Jay Flatley","Well, we\u2019re doing both. It\u2019s certainly is a function of time but partly the reason is the function of time is that we continue to make the 2500 better over time. And as we add new capability to that and things like long reads, the gap between what you can do on a 2500 and what you could do on the older systems gets bigger.","And so I think those two factors work in conjunction and over the next couple of years I think will drive a relatively significant upgrade cycle for us.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Got it. And then also on the X Ten consumable usage, just curious can you give us some context in terms of the installed base now in terms of how they are using the machines, are they a mix of high-end and maybe people who are just ramping up? The purpose of the question is just thinking about how that might trend going forward? With the HiSeq, obviously, it's been relatively flat within a range; is that how we should think about X Ten per machine usage?","Jay Flatley","Well, we have a mix of customer types, Amanda. So, we do have some of the earliest users who are the high throughput users that we expected in there fully operational and running in production mode. So that tends to buy us their reagent store, the higher end.","And then we have reasonable distribution to customers who are new to large scale sequencing and that tends to drag it down.","So, you\u2019ll see customers all the way from probably the 70% to 80% utilization on the high end down to the sort of 20% utilization on the low end.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Okay. And that should maybe stay relatively similar going forward then?","Jay Flatley","Well, no. We hope to push the low ones up and those are both a function of developing the sample pipeline and making sure that those pipelines are rich in numbers and that those samples arrive on a regular basis and \u2013 for example, several customers who are using these in a service environment and those tend to be kind of lumpy until you actually build up a bigger backlog of customers that are using them regularly as a service.","But we tend to \u2013 or we want to push those lower percentage users up to the 50% rate or so. So, that\u2019s certainly our hope here over the next six months.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company","Got it. Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon guys, thanks. Just want to ask a question about gross margin. I saw a pretty big improvement there and was hoping maybe you could deconstruct the drivers of the improvement a little bit? And specifically if you could comment on how much of the improvement in gross margin is due to better pricing across the instrument lines versus overall business mix, just trying to figure out what drove the improvement and how to think about it going forward?","Jay Flatley","Well, let me give you some general comments and I don\u2019t know if Marc will have anything more specific, but, I think one underlying trend that\u2019s critically important here is overall increasing margins on the instruments.","We talked a bit about that on HiSeq X, because there's a price point and the fact we\u2019re not discounting those, our margins on that product compared to the percentage margins we get on the 2500 are substantially higher. So, that\u2019s been a key driver particularly in a quarter like Q3 when we shipped a fair number of HiSeq X\u2019s.","NextSeq as Francis mentioned had a very aggressive gross margin target from the day we first put it into product development and well, you never quite are at the target you want when you first start shipping a product.","We\u2019ve grown into that target quite quickly on NextSeq as the volumes have been very strong and so we\u2019re starting to get the volume discounts on the components that we would have expected and we\u2019re coming down the cost curve of our NextSeq at a pretty good clip. So, that means that NextSeq is an overall very positive addition to the gross margin cycle.","I see MiSeq as a bit of a headwind in the other direction because we lowered the price of MiSeq and it\u2019s relatively stable instrument from a technology perspective to gross margins on that box compared to where we were say a year ago or less percentage wise.","So, I think instruments are probably the biggest part of the story here and had we not had that great improvement in the instruments, the margins would have gone the other direction because the overall mix between consumables and instruments has gone more towards instruments and so it\u2019s obviously a great thing that we made those improvements and the net of it is a positive overall lift of the gross margin number.","Another key factor of course is the fact that just the amount of revenue beat that we had in the quarter pushes our factories to very full utilization. So overhead absorption is a huge factor as we get to that marginal $10 million or $15 million of extra revenue on a given quarter. The incremental margin on that last bit of revenue is huge because you fully absorb value or overhead.","Marc Stapley","Yeah, nothing really specific to add Jay. It\u2019s kind of hard to bifurcate the increase in gross margin but with the improvement as you mentioned in the instruments, and then also remember the other instruments moving more towards the HiSeq 2500 and away from say the HiSeq 2,000 a year ago etcetera would have helped a little bit.","And those are as I mentioned in my remarks, we expect the mix of consumables and instruments to be kind of static around that mid-50s level and so, even with that the kind of gross margins we\u2019re seeing as sustainable as long as we view it on how significant investments in the future in production capabilities.","As Jay mentioned, we\u2019ve been running pretty flat out on lot of our facilities and that\u2019s given us tremendous leverage. So I think really, I would put that leverage as probably one of the biggest drivers and then the instrument margins and the effect of that as another.","Jay Flatley","The last thing I would add is that our field experience on the instruments is continuing to get better. We put a lot of energy into this over the last couple of years and we had some challenges with valves and things like that, liquid handling, a couple of years ago in some of the instruments and so our warranty experience is continuing to improve, particularly in the newer instruments like NextSeq where we made data much more solid state instrument which helps the overall margin numbers.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","That's great color. Thanks a bunch. Just one other on the general demand outlook on instruments, I think you mentioned in your prepared comments that you had a pretty good uptake of both NextSeq and MiSeq for new customers, and I was wondering if you can give me a sense for NextSeq specifically how many of those customers are new Illumina NGS users? And then secondly, for MiSeq can you give us any sense of what you think MiSeq versus MiSeq DX demand will look like over the next however period of time you're willing to talk about? Thank you.","Marc Stapley","Well, NextSeq, we said that about a third of the orders came from new customers and so we think that's new to Illumina, so we don\u2019t have any other products from us and the great thing about that of course is that it\u2019s pure market expansion and that\u2019s what this system was designed to do, is to hit a price in a performance window that would bring in new applications and new customer types.","And so, I think we\u2019re rapidly experiencing that with NextSeq and we\u2019re really pleased with how that product\u2019s is being accepted into the marketplace overall. I am sorry, the second part of the question was?","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","MiSeq, just wondering if demand outlook there, you have MiSeq DX now, so should we be assuming that the majority of the users are on the DX side versus researcher or could be more evenly split?","Marc Stapley","No. I see the DX as still a small fraction of the total MiSeq that we ship. It\u2019s a growing percentage and I think over time will become more and more as a fraction of the total.","We do see I think a general uplift in MiSeq purchases in general just because we have an FDA approved box. So customers might buy MiSeq, do their initial clinical development on a system that\u2019s cheaper because it\u2019s a $25,000 uplift if you buy the DX version and then when they actually go to deploy, they might deploy on the DX version.","And, so that\u2019s one of the reasons that we think over time the fraction will increase but right now it\u2019s still a small percentage of the total.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs","That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks. Good afternoon everybody. In terms of the v2 consumables rollout here Jay, how should we think about Illumina's role in making sure that that's a fairly seamless transition? In other words, should we expect any, albeit temporary, slowdown in the systems that are going from v1 to v2?","Jay Flatley","No, I don\u2019t think so. In this case, these reagents are either direct substitutes, say in the case of NextSeq there'll be probably a six month overlap or seven customers who want to continue to use the one simply just for continuity in their experimental data, but the shift to V2, there\u2019s no pricing difference, there\u2019s no output difference.","So, I don\u2019t think of any risk of lag in the marketplace and similarly for DX, we\u2019ve just broadened the number of applications that customers can run. So, we don\u2019t think of anything at all, be a potential accelerator of consumables that there won\u2019t be any pausing that we anticipate.","Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, excellent. And then secondly, just on sequencing reimbursement and I'm thinking outside of NIPT, candidly there's been some mixed messages, somewhat negative from payers, but yet the customer lab experience tends to be a little bit better. Where are you in terms of thinking about reimbursement and helping make this as seamless a process as it can be for customers?","Jay Flatley","Well, as you know, the only direct test that we market is the NIPG test where we're largely reimbursed. So, Illumina doesn\u2019t have a direct need to get reimbursement for other products that we have.","Of course our customers do and as a result of that, we are working at a more global level with the payer community to undertake some very interesting proof of principal projects, I would call them where we\u2019re demonstrating the sort of the efficacy of using sequencing in diagnostic environments as well as the potential improvements in health economics.","And, if we can begin to demonstrate that, I think it will help the overall environment for reimbursement and I think that\u2019s the critical role that Illumina needs to play here.","Bill Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Very good. Thanks guys, great quarter.","Jay Flatley","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. I will ask two on oncology. One, sorry if I missed it, but I believe in the last quarter you gave a dollar figure, Jay, for the size of the oncology business in the quarter and a growth rate. It would be great to get an update on how that trended in the third quarter. And then I will go ahead and ask my follow-up in oncology and it relates to the Actionable Genome Consortium.","Now that you're getting closer to the commercialization of a panel, the filing of the panel product and closer to the publication of that document, I wonder if you can share any learnings from that process and give us a sense for how that might be impacting your thinking, thinking about how you ultimately structure and commercialize that panel product. Thank you.","Jay Flatley","Yeah, on the first question, we said last quarter that we had about $90 million of overall revenue that came from oncology in total, so that was research and clinical applications. We think that\u2019s gone up a bit in Q3 not dramatically. So, still less than $100 million I\u2019d say in Q3.","With respect to what we\u2019re doing with the Actionable Genome Consortium and observations, a couple, one is that they are very excited about the work because they got it done faster than we thought. So they\u2019ve put the standards in place and it\u2019s being prepared for publication as we\u2019ve mentioned.","The second observation is that there\u2019s a general tendency toward increasing content on the panels and we\u2019re trying to figure out ways of making sure that we don\u2019t get gene creep, I guess is probably the right word to use where the panel just keeps getting perpetually larger because everybody wants their incremental five genes. And so locking down exactly what the content needs to be is challenging and an opportunity.","Clearly in the long run Illumina's view is that this ought to get to whole genome, but that\u2019s going to take some time particularly because this panel we want to be as tightly correlated with actionable outcomes as we can possibly make it for the treating physicians and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be necessary to begin large scale of option.","Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities","Thanks, good afternoon everybody. Jay, it sounded like you said that there's 70% sequential NIPT sample growth? Just want to confirm if that's right, and if so, what are the drivers? And if you could talk about how LabCorp and Progenity, those two wins are playing out.","Jay Flatley","Yeah, that\u2019s the right number. It\u2019s a big number, it\u2019s kind of startling to us when we actually got the statistics on that and it\u2019s the progress of our test send out business largely through third parties, not from our direct sales force. So, our direct sales force we continue to not add resources to the direct team.","So, this is through some of the third party deals that we\u2019ve done in the United States. Both the lab core and the progenity relationships continue very positively and we\u2019re excited about both of them.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities","Great, thanks. And just quick follow-up on the SG&A leverage, very impressive there. In the recent past, I know you've talked about having to invest to develop new markets. How much active market development are you doing right now, and how are you thinking about that for next year? Thanks a lot.","Jay Flatley","Yeah, I\u2019d say we\u2019re doing quite a bit of market development in the target markets that we\u2019ve already talked about, those being HLA and forensics in particular. We\u2019re going to all the trade shows. We\u2019re meeting routinely with customers. This is from a marketing perspective, not from a sales perspective.","We are engaging with the KOLs and the thought leaders. We\u2019re holding meetings with those KOLs. So all the normal things you\u2019d expect in terms of getting the market ready for the launch of these products we\u2019re deeply involved in.","So, big investment going on there, but quite targeted. So, it's a handful of people. It\u2019s not the entire sales force yet.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.","Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Yes, thanks for the question. The first one is on the X Ten, you mentioned some of the higher throughput customers are at a 70% to 80% consumables utilization rate, I guess 70% to 80% of the theoretical max. Is there any reason why that couldn't get up closer to 100%?","And then as a follow-on, obviously it's below the third quarter, but when I look at the sequential implied guidance to the fourth quarter, it's not as robust as it's been in prior years; is that just a matter of the X Ten slowdown you mentioned sequentially, or is there anything else in the fourth quarter?","Jay Flatley","Yeah, I\u2019ll take the first part and I'll let Marc handle the second part. Yeah, we would never expect any customer to get to 100% on our most proficient HiSeq 2500 users who have these up and running for years and have very intricate limb systems for re-queuing samples and sample quality, control to high 80% or maybe up to 90% in the most extreme cases.","So, getting to 70 or 80 HiSeq platform is pretty darned good for now. They might inch up a bit but 90 is, when we take the maximum if you ran it absolutely every minute of the year, we always take 10% off as where we start the calculations. You could never really get above 90%.","Marc Stapley","Yeah, on the fourth quarter guidance, I think it\u2019s exactly what you said. The biggest driver is the reduction in HiSeq X placements in the fourth quarter that we\u2019ve talked about. A couple of headwinds as well. We\u2019re not expecting Japan to pick up in the fourth quarter. So, similar to Q3 in that respect it was significantly down.","And then also foreign exchange headwind, think about it in terms of about 1% of revenue or thereabout. So, three things combined is really what\u2019s behind the growth rate, the guidance that drives the fourth quarter number.","Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Miroslava Minkova, Stifel. Please proceed.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi Jay, hi Marc, congratulations on the quarter. Let me perhaps ask a question about clinical markets. There have been some major milestones, it seems, over the past quarter with the Actionable Genome Consortium and the pharma agreements, and most recently the Myraqa acquisition. At the ASHG meeting here, it seems like there's quite a bit of focus on the clinic. Can you perhaps share with us how you feel about the progress you are making in the clinical markets versus your plan? And maybe update us on the time line for IVD submission for NIPT and the onco panels?","Jay Flatley","I guess on the clinical penetration, I would firstly say that what\u2019s happened over the last couple of years has greatly exceeded our expectations of how fast the clinical markets would adopt next generation sequencing.","This was initially driven largely by what happened in the NIPT market, we need to essentially create those catalysts in the oncology market, which we\u2019re working very hard on and use the rationale behind what we\u2019ve done with the Actionable Genome Consortium and the onco panel consortium.","On the foot side of that, I\u2019d say there\u2019s a lot yet to be done. So, as a company we are very focused on trying to work hard to become clinically ready and this requires improvements across much of our infrastructure in order to be able to deliver and support clinical customers to the standards that they\u2019re accustomed to and that\u2019s everywhere from how fast we can get our service person to their laboratory to how fast they can get reagents once they order them to how well they can trace back a single component of a reagent all the way through the supply chain.","And so as a company we are working on implementing that infrastructure and at the same time retaining the nimbleness that we\u2019re known for in the research market.","So, there\u2019s challenges around that, but it\u2019s a project that we\u2019re very involved in right now and we\u2019ll be investing in heavily over the next three years or so.","With respect to IVD submissions, we don\u2019t really have any new news for you today. Our goal is to have the first version of the AGC defined product into the market in 2015 that will be for RUO purposes and then we\u2019ll begin doing the clinical trials with that product and depending on how long those clinical trials it will determine the timeframe for doing submission to the FDA.","It won\u2019t be gated by the product itself, but it will be gated by how long and how extensive the clinical trial work needs to be and we don\u2019t really have any new updates on the NIPT submission at this point.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay great. Thank you. And perhaps on the 15 X Ten customers or orders that you have, would you be willing to share how many of these are actually up and running?","Jay Flatley","Well, other than the last few, almost all of them have at least one system now.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Jay Flatley","So of the 15, I don't know this number exactly, but I would say 11 of them probably have one or more systems now.","Miroslava Minkova - Stifel Nicolaus","Excellent. Thank you so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that concludes today\u2019s Q&A.

Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina ended 2018 on a high note. With record revenue of $867 million, up 11% from the fourth quarter of 2017. For 2018, Illumina reported of $3.3 billion, up 21% reflecting strong demand for sequencing and array systems, consumables and services. 2018 represented our 20th consecutive year of growth as genomics continues to enable an increasing number of research, translational and clinical applications across a broad range of customers.","In the fourth quarter of 2018, sequencing consumable revenue of $466 million grew 8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Normalizing for timing of stocking orders, sequencing consumable growth was 16% and oversea consumable pull through was roughly flat with the record level we reported in the third quarter. For the full year, 2018 sequencing consumable revenue grew 23% or more than $300 million to $1.8 billion. Growth was visible across our high throughput, mid throughput and low throughput categories. And Illumina continues to uniquely support the broadest range of customer application and throughput requirements.","Within the high throughput family, HiSeq consumables continue their expected decline as customers' transition to NovaSeq. For the full year NovaSeq consumable revenue increased by a factor of more than five. For 2019, and as part of our strategy to support a multiyear transition from HiSeq, we are catalyzing the next wave of upgrades among our low throughput HiSeq customers. We are doing this in two ways. First, we are launching S Prime, our newest NovaSeq flow cell in February. And second, we've reduced the list price of the S1 and S2 flow cells by approximately 25% and 10% respectively.","We believe it's important to help customers of all sizes unlock the power of the genome. And these changes will enable even greater flexibility allowing lower throughput customers to sequence on demand rather than waiting to batch on the larger flow cell. There have been no changes to the pricing of our S4 flow cell which continues to represent the majority of NovaSeq consumable revenue. It was another record quarter for our mid throughput sequencing consumable revenue. In large part due to growing adoption of oncology and NIPT applications. Once again NextSeq throughput system was at the high end of the $100,000 to $150,000 per year range.","And the low throughput family delivered strong year-over-year growth with pull through for both MiSeq and MiniSeq within the respective ranges, and modest contribution from IC consumables.","Moving to sequencing systems. Revenue of $159 million was up 21% year-over-year, representing a new quarterly record for Illumina. As we anticipated the fourth quarter was a strongest of the year with robust performance across the portfolio, including more than 100 NovaSeq shipments. Since launch, we had shipped approximately 600 NovaSeq by the end of 2018, up from the 285 installed at the end of 2017. And we continue to see strong demand from both existing and new customers. About 75% of the HiSeq installed based has yet to take even if its first NovaSeq.","So we believe that we are in the very early stages of a conversion cycle that will span multiple years. In addition to the HiSeq upgrade cycle, we continue to see strong adoption from new to Illumina and desktop conversion customers. This group represents about 30% of orders since launch, expanding our footprint of high throughput users. In the fourth quarter, new customers included one lab that is using NovaSeq to build out a full service hematology pathology lab, bringing clinical trials to community hospitals.","Other new customers who are bringing sequencing in house had initially plan on purchasing a NextSeq, but decided to purchase NovaSeq to prepare for higher output in the future. And one of our desktop customers is now using NovaSeq to support multi-omic translation research to drive precision medicine efforts.","NextSeq placements were strong. And in fact NextSeq shipment revenue was the second highest in any quarter since launch. Once again, we saw good mix of existing and new to sequencing customers. With oncology and NIPT, the primary drivers of system acquisition. NextSeqDx was approved the PMDA in Japan, establishing Illumina's first IVD registered instrument in the country as we work to bring NGS applications into clinical care.","Building on this approval, I am pleased to announce our partnership with Sysmex Corporation to commercialize the first NGS based oncology IVD panel in Japan. This test will be run the NextSeqDx system and be based on a PMDA approved 114 gene panel developed by Sysmex and the National Cancer Center, Japan. Within our low throughput system family both MiSeq and MinSeq shipments were up sequentially. And HiSeq ended the year with approximately 350 units shipped in his first two quarters of launch. About of half of these HiSeq shipments were to new Illumina customers.","Collectively, these customers are utilizing the iSeq across a broad range of applications, including library quality control, metagenomics, targeted re-sequencing and infield disease and outbreak monitoring. For example, one customer is now using the iSeq for plasmid characterization and synthesis conformation in place of CE sequencing. Another customer is using the iSeq to sequence bacterial and viral genomes, as well as disease vectors from mosquitoes.","Moving to sequencing services and other. Revenue of $104 million was up 20% from the same quarter a year ago, largely driven by GeL. Revenue was down sequentially primarily due to oncology collaborations payment in the third quarter that did not repeat in the fourth. In total, our sequencing revenue grew 12% in the fourth quarter of 2018. For the full year 2018, sequencing revenue grew 21% with solid growth across research, translational and clinical applications. Across these areas, we continue to be encouraged by a myriad of developments that we believe will enable genomic to continue to progression from research to the clinic and over time to standard of care.","We continue to see a broad range of research efforts leveraging NGS. For example, just last week, Cancer Research, UK announced three new international initiatives to tackle some of the biggest research challenges in cancer. The microbiome, chronic inflammation and why cancer is doing some tissues but not others. These research programs were collectively awarded \u00a360 million. One of the program is led by a team of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Harvard Medical School that is exploring the relationship between the microbiome and colon cancer.","Moving on, population genomics initiative has multiplied from a handful of failed lasers to dozens of efforts intended to improve human health. We are tracking around 50 global initiatives and expect several to begin ramping using Illumina technology in 2019. Despite GeL's completion of its 100,000 genomes and gradual transition into clinical practice, we expect population genomics to contribute to revenue growth this year. To give just a few examples, all of us will begin its journey to genotype and sequence one million participants.","France will launch its pilot program for whole-genome and exome sequencing. As well as RNA-Seq to ultimately sequence 235,000 genomes a year. And Singapore will continue its - the first wave of the 10-K project, which is a three phase initiative to sequence 150,000 whole-genomes and genotype 1 million samples by 2028. We also continue to see excellent progress in the evolution of our oncology, rugged and NIPT markets.","Next generation sequencing continues to redefine the way clinicians are approaching oncology. With the regulatory and reimbursement environment evolving rapidly to support to innovative approaches like comprehensive tumor profiling and liquid biopsy.","Illumina is extremely proud to have been granted breakthrough device designation for the two site assay that is in development. We joined a short and prestigious list of leading innovators in oncology diagnostics and look forward to bringing our distributable 523 gene tumor profiling panel to market. The assay has been designed to detect known and emerging tumor biomarker including MSI, TMB and gene fusions in variation for targeted therapies. The hope is that this pan-cancer assay will deliver clinically actionable data to ensure patients are matched with the optimal therapeutic or clinical trial.","While we continue to drive IVD development with partners the assay is based on the content of TSO500 which is now available as an RUO. We are pleased with the initial customer response from our early access sites around the world and we expect the vast majority to add the RUO assay to their lab offering.","Other early adopters include China's ChosenMed which is working in support of the cancer genetic atlas of China. ChosenMed will use TSO500 as part of the $15 million grant to build the bank of 10,000 tumor samples.","Moving to NIPT, coverage for average risk pregnancy continues to increase is not at 46% in the US, while higher risk pregnancy coverage is around 96%. More than 40% of all births in the US are to families eligible for Medicaid and with the addition of Pennsylvania and Ohio in January, the number of states covering average risk in NIPT increased to five.","Looking abroad, France recently announces that they will reimburse at approximately EUR360 for trisomy 21 NIPT. Screen will be offered to women with contingent risk between 1 and 51 and 1 and 1,000 representing nearly 8% of pregnancies.","Additionally, in the first half of 2019, we will ship VeriSeq NIPT version 2 which adds carrier type resolution across the genome, and increases the number of genetic diseases that can be detected. For rugged --, expanded coverage to whole-exome sequencing which brings total lives covered to 147 million. This coupled with the CMS' final CPT quote pricing of over $5,000 per genome for rugged patients enables more patients to access NGS helping to end the diagnostic oddities.","And just few weeks ago, Priority Health, a health insurance plan was one million lives in Michigan issued the first positive coverage policy specifically for WGS for acutely old patients. While utilization today remains nascent, we believe the genomic testing is poised to become the standard of care for rugged patients. Illumina is working to help accelerate adoption. For example, recently partnering with Victorian Clinical Genetic Services and not for profit providing rugged service in Australia.","Moving to arrays. Revenue up $132 million was up 7% from the same quarter in 2017. As we expected, revenue was down sequentially with lower system revenue following the record third quarter and a decrease in array services revenue. This sequential step down in array services is in line with the recent revenue trend from Q3 into Q4. That said, array growth is expected to slow in 2019. We have factored this into our guidance and expect revenue growth to reaccelerate as health based apps are more widely adopted. And as genealogy and other tests are introduced in new markets outside the US.","Moving to regional results. Americas revenue grew 12% versus the prior year period and grew sequentially for the eight straight quarter with strong performance across the business. EMEA delivered record revenue quarter with 12% growth from the prior year period, including a strong contribution from Genomics England which announced last month that it sequenced the 100,000 whole genome. Other growth drivers included robust sequencing system placements notably NovaSeq shipments and sequencing consumables.","Greater China grew 8% year-over-year with sequencing growth moderated by the effects of tariff related stocking in Q2 and Q3 of 2018. When adjusting for the tariff impact, the region grew 28% from the prior year period. Finally, APJ revenue of $70 million was up 9% from the fourth quarter of 2017. And up 21% sequentially. NIPT continues to make headway in the region as we signed up our first partner in Korea. Biogenome and look to expand further in 2019.","With that I'll hand the call over to Sam for review our quarterly financials. Sam?","Sam Samad","Thanks Francis. As discussed fourth quarter revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $867 million, driven by 12% growth in sequencing and 7% growth in micro arrays. Sequencing consumable revenue of $466 million was down slightly on a sequential basis. And up 8% from the same quarter a year ago. As discussed in previous quarter, we experienced some shifts on the timing of customer order associated with China tariff related stocking.","In the fourth quarter, this included approximately $5 million of sequencing consumable revenue that was previously expected in the first quarter of 2019. Normalizing for the China related stocking in 2018, sequencing consumables revenue was up $19 million sequentially in Q4. And after also adjusting for sizable stocking order in the fourth quarter of 2017, sequencing consumable revenue grew 16% year-over-year.","Array consumables in Q4 grew $13 million sequentially and were up $14 million or 17% versus Q4 of 2017. As Francis noted, sequencing service revenue of $104 million was down $5 million sequentially and up 20% year-over-year. Array services were down $9 million sequentially and down 22% year-over-year.","Combined total consumable and service revenue represented 80% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 83% for the full year. This compares to 81% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 81% for the full year 2017.","Moving to systems. Sequencing systems grew $21 million sequentially and 21% versus the same period last year. Array systems were down $5 million sequentially and up $3 million versus Q4 of 2017. Instrument revenue therefore represented 20% of total revenue in the quarter and 17% for 2018.","Moving to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of this non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 69.1% decreased almost 200 basis points compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by product mix. Year-over-year fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin decreased 180 basis points primarily due to product mix and lower margins in our services business. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $388 million were up $32 million from last quarter, largely reflecting the timing OpEx spend weighted towards the end of the year, specifically higher R&D and marketing spend.","Non-GAAP operating margin was therefore 24.3% down from 29.4% last quarter, excluding Helix, operating margin was 27.1% compared to 32% last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 16.3% was down from last quarter due to prior year tax return adjustments.","For the fourth quarter of 2018, GAAP net income was $210 million, or $1.41 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $197 million, or $1.32 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations was $300 million. DSO at 54 days was higher compared to 46 days last quarter, driven by less favorable revenue linearity and geography. In addition to collection seasonality.","Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $65 million and Q4 free cash flow was $235 million. This quarter we repurchased 98 million of stock leaving 49 million available for share repurchases under our current plan. We ended the year with approximately $3.5 billion in cash, cash equivalent and short term investments.","As of January 1st, the 2019 and 2021 notes were no longer convertible. However, approximately one million shares remain in our Q4 diluted share count because our share price has exceeded the conversion price. As such our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 149 million. The 2019 notes will become convertible again on March 15, 2019 ahead of maturity three months later. We expect to repay the $633 million principal in cash and issue stock for the premium which is expected to approximate around $150 million depending on stock price.","Moving to guidance, as we previously shared, we expect full year 2019 revenue to grow in the range of 13% to 14% or $3.77 billion to $3.8 billion, representing an increase of approximately $450 million at the midpoint. This guidance allows us for less favorable FX environment that reduced our full year growth expectations by approximately 1%. Regarding revenue linearity, we expect 2019 to be more back end loaded than it was in 2018. As a reference, revenue split in 2018 was 48% in the first half and 52% in the second half. We expect the proportion of revenue in the second half of 2019 to exceed 52%.","We expect sequencing revenue to grow in the mid-teen and sequencing consumables to grow above 20%. And we expect the array revenue to grow in the low single digit range reflecting a cautious view on the consumer opportunity. In addition in 2019, we expect sequencing systems to grow in the mid single digit with NovaSeq shipments expected to be flat to slightly up compared to 2018, consistent with our expectation for steady, multiyear upgrade cycle.","We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be down slightly from 2018 with a higher revenue contribution from lower margin population genomic initiatives and our oncology collaborations. Compared to 2018, we expect operating expenses to be down slightly on a percentage of revenue basis.","We expect the 2018 tax rate to be approximately 17%, up from 2018 due to a onetime tax benefit related to Helix investment in 2018. Therefore, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.07 to $6.17 and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.50 to $6.60. This includes approximately $0.20 of Helix dilution.","For the first quarter of 2019, we expect total revenue to be down on a sequential basis due to lower sequencing system revenue which is consistent with the trend we've seen over the past four years. Following our record fourth quarter performance, we therefore expect sequencing system revenue to decline approximately $50 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.","Offsetting this in part we expect sequencing consumables to be flat to slightly up sequentially from the $466 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. Sequencing services and others to be flat with growth offset by the expected decline in GeL revenue. And we expect micro arrays to grow sequentially in the mid to high single digits.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be up slightly compared to 69.1% in the fourth quarter due to favorable mix partially offset by higher expected array service revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be flat on a percentage of revenue basis compared to the 44.8% reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. And we expect the first quarter tax rate to be meaningfully lower than our expected full year rate due to onetime benefit.","Finally, we don't expect any meaningful change in share count this quarter compared to last quarter. Francis?","Francis deSouza","Thank you, Sam. 2018 was a spectacular for Illumina. We saw genomic inch closer to broad clinical adoption with an evolving regulatory environment and incremental reimbursement in NIPT, in rare and undiagnosed disease and in oncology. These developments can only further invigorate research and translation work in genomics as academics, institutions and even nations are around the world invests in the promise of precision medicine.","As with many of the most exciting scientific discovery before us, the path is in perfectly linear. What is clear is that Illumina remains in the earliest innings and our journey to improve human health by unlocking the power of the human genome. A wave of population genomic initiatives will start to ramp this year. A growing number of cancer patients will gain access to genomic testing and oncology diagnostics, more pregnant mothers than ever before will be screened with the non-invasive prenatal test. And more children will have access to genomic test that could end unnecessary and costly diagnostic oddities.","And above all, Illumina will continue to innovate and to push the limits of sequencing. We will continue to listen and partner with our customers to turn today's impossible into possible.","With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Thanks. I want to start with the guidance for sequencing consumable growth, greater than 20% is certainly very impressing. I am just wondering, Francis, if you can provide a little bit color on how you are getting there? Is that really all driven by upside from NovaSeq or are you seeing any slower ramp down in HiSeq utilization and are you factoring in contributions from some of these expanded POPSEQ initiatives?","And then just as a follow up I am wondering can you confirm whether you actually hit guidance for the NovaSeq placement for 2018? I think you talked about around 600 installed, but we had a few people asking about what you actually hit there, 320, 330, 350 guidance.","Francis deSouza","Sure. Let me start with the question around what will drive the consumable growth in 2019. We said the consumable growth to be driven by customers across the entire sequencing portfolio from MiSeq all the way through NovaSeq and across the range of applications. If we look into the rest of this year, we talked about the stock that we are seeing, a number of these population genomic initiatives ramp up over the course of the year. We talked about the fact that we saw record systems placements happened in the last quarter of last year.","And so expect to see growth from the NextSeq step we placed. We expect to see growth from the record number of NovaSeq that we placed in Q4. And then we expect to see continued growth from the uptick in NIPT done primarily around that growth that we are seeing in Europe. So the growth in sequencing consumable is very broad based, across our portfolio, across the applications.","In terms of NovaSeq placements, I said in the prepared remarks that we exited 2017 with approximately 285 NovaSeq placements in 2017 and we exited 2018 with about 600 NovaSeq. So the number we placed were short of the 330. And frankly that's driven by just timing in terms of customers and when they choose to take systems. As we take a step back and look at how the NovaSeq update cycle is evolving, it's really playing out generally as we had expected.","We started last year with the S 4 building momentum just start to see some of our large NovaSeq customers begin the transition from HiSeq into NovaSeq. And then this year with the launch of S prime and the pricing adjustments on S 1 and S 2, we expect to start see some of the smaller high throughput lab begin their upgrade journey. So as we planned, this was a multiyear upgrade cycle for HiSeq customers and it's going to play out that way.","Operator","And our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from the Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hello, good afternoon. A couple of questions. So the first one on the array guide. Can you sort of walk through what you sort of seeing in the DTC genomics market? Is the question of basically people buying kits, not turning them back, or it's like all the people that sort of interested in ancestry testing and heritage testing basically done with that. And now you are looking for new expansion in that market. And also can you sort of do a comment on where we are with the PacBio transaction? And just update on regulatory there. Are you getting any incremental - you got request information. I am just really curious, can you update us on that process. Thanks.","Francis deSouza","Sure. On the array side, as you know we had very spectacular growth in 2017 where we genotype about 7 million consumers and then again in 2018 where we genotype about 12 million consumers. So in working with our direct-to-consumer customers and looking at 2018, they felt that the right answer was to think about growth moderating given the size of the numbers they've seen over the last couple of years.","And so our forecast is based on working closely with them. What we believe jointly them we will see that growth reaccelerate as we start to see this market show up as a health market as well as the genealogy market. And then for us, we will see another vector of growth kick-in as we start to see the customers outside the US ramp up. So we had lots of interest from DTC customers especially in Asia. And so we started to engage with those customers. And we expect those customers to start to ramp up playing out starting this year and then going into the future. So we expect to see reacceleration of that market. But for this year we model it down into the single digit.","And on the PacBio side, so where we are is we got the second request from the FTC as we expected. And so we are in the information gathering phase. And so the process in general is going as we expected and we still expected to be a midyear close.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, guys and congrats. So maybe just talking about going back to Tycho's point of both NovaSeq and just sort of kind of the cadence of consumable growth. Obviously, with all of the stocking orders, it sort of little bit hard to tease out some of the underlying. If you look at sort of where utilization is gone and as you can see sort of the projects starts and then project stops. I mean clearly the guides for the year on sequencing consumables are strong. I guess I am just trying to get sense in terms of the back half weighting. How much of that is sort of the dynamic we saw this year where you had instruments that really picked up in the back half?","But it doesn't necessarily seem like that versus maybe project starting over the balance of the year and then cycling through some pieces that are coming off and so that all naturally pull up kind of the back half growth. I am just trying to get sort of little bit color on what's drive the cadence?","Francis deSouza","Sure. So if you look at the cadence in our business in any year, our business tends to back half loaded. So we talked about the fact. Last year we saw about 52% of our business done in the back half of the year. And that seasonality is driven primarily because you have two ends of year effects playing out. You have the end of the US federal; you have the government year that is in Q3. And then you have the fiscal calendar year obviously that closer to the end of the year.","And so that's always driven for us not only strong system orders but also strong consumables orders. This year we expected to a little bit more pronounce than usual because as you pointed out we will see all the usual effects, but then we start to see things like some of the population sequencing efforts that will be ramping up over the course of the year. And really start to hit their stride over the back half of the year. As an example, if you look at GeL, they just wrapped their 100,000 genome in Q4. And they are in the transition phase to really moving into an NHS driven sequencing service.","And that will take some time. And so that will really start to play out more in the back half of the year than in the first half of the year. Similarly, if you start to look at all of us in the US or France, you will see that same dynamic play out. And so you take our normal seasonality and then you layer in this effect and you will see this year is more back end loaded than the usual.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good afternoon. I guess a couple quick ones. I am not sure if this relates to Helix or not but the redeemable non-control interest balance on your balance sheet dropped from $218 million in Q3 to $61 million in Q4. I am just wondering what drove that? And then going back to the placement number for the year for NovaSeq. You now acknowledge that you missed the low end of your target for 330 placements in the year. Yet you said you shipped over 100 in the quarter. So I am just wondering first off what exactly were you thinking you were going to do in the quarter because 100 is pretty good? A lot more than team on the surface pretty aggressive. So I am just wondering if there is some disconnect between timing of shipments and when revenue was wracked, if you just really were that aggressive on your quarterly expectation. Thank you.","Sam Samad","So with regard to the redeemable, that's related to the valuation that we perform usually on annual basis regarding Helix. So that's a result of that annual valuation that we do. And Francis if you add the -","Francis deSouza","Yes. So if you look at the NovaSeq number, we did come short of the 330 as I said earlier. And what drove our thinking is always the customers are working, we are working within pipeline. And what we are expecting to close over the course of a quarter and then over the course of the year. As I said, we still have three quarters of our HiSeq customers yet to purchase their first NovaSeq. So you can imagine we are working with a lot of customers in the pipeline.","And in any given time, we are working with them to estimate when they will take their NovaSeq. And the way it played out is in terms of timing, fewer took their NovaSeq in Q4 than we were anticipating, but that's just the timing issue. We are continuing to work with those customers. And we expect those customers to come in the coming quarters.","Operator","And our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink. Your line is open.","Puneet Souda","Thanks for the question. Francis if I could ask about the broader 600 plus customers, you have S Prime on the market. You are discounting S1 and S2. I was hoping to get a sense from you in terms of how do you expect that market to uptake NovaSeq there? I mean on one hand you have a share number of this lab but on the other hand they have little bit less capital budget flexibility compared to the larger customers. You have given their grand cycle and projects and so. So I just wanted to get your view of uptake overall there and then just on population sequencing, what needs to happen in order to bring the 5 million plus or sort of 6 million genomes closer to the sequencer. Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Sure, Puneet. So let me jump in on the NovaSeq upgrade cycle first. So as you pointed out, it's the smaller lab that typically has less flexibility around and quick access to capital. And so as we were planning multiyear NovaSeq upgrade cycle, our size it was ready to target the larger labs first. So when what you saw is come out of the S4 a while ago and really around 2018 we engaged with the lot of larger customers. The lot of the larger high throughput customers. That have more ready access to capital and because of the high volume of sequencing that they do so we can have a shorter payback time.","And so that was the story for us as of 2018. Yes, we did sell NovaSeq across the board and we did sell NovaSeq to new to sequencing customers too but really our focus was really taking the S4. And you can see the remarks I made around S4 being the majority of the NovaSeq flow cell revenue in 2018.","In 2019, we now had time for the smaller lab to think about that NovaSeq upgrade. And to either write the grant that they needed to or get access to budget they needed to. And so this is the year that we want to activate that part of the HiSeq user base. And to do that we needed some very specific offerings. So for example, there are some customers, some HiSeq 2,500 customers that really use the rapid run mode a lot. And so what they wanted was a flow cell that gave them lower run cost, fast run time and be able to run fewer samples and therefore need less data output.","And that's exactly what the S Prime is targeted at now. It's coming out this quarter and it's intended to catalyze that customer that part of the customer base, right, and the HiSeq 2,500 customers that love rapid run. And there are other HiSeq 2,500 customers at 3,000 and 4,000 that wanted a flow cell that can costing in the 12 to 18 months period. And those are not necessarily very small. They could be lab that do $0.5 million of business with us a year in consumable revenue. And for them the new pricing around S1 and S2 is a really good fit. And so this is the year we want to catalyze the smaller HiSeq customers and that the arsenal we have. The S Prime, S1 and S2 at their new pricing.","And then the second question you had was around population sequencing. And your question was around, so what is it take to catalyze those opportunity? And there are a number of things that it takes. We did a few years ago actually starting with GeL was we created at Illumina a team that's dedicated to population sequencing effort. So that's the team that coordinates across Illumina but represents the point of engagement to those 50 plus population sequencing opportunities that I talked about.","And depending on the initiative there are different roles that we play. We are deeply connected in some countries with the scientific and medical community to explain the value of a population sequencing effort, and help the local medical and scientific community articulate the population benefits to the citizens. In some cases, we put together and are able to share reference architecture around how you actually set a population sequencing effort.","In another cases, we are able to convene groups from nations around the world with representatives from Genomics England for example where they can share their experiences around what they learned even in things like how you set up the cohorts for sequencing or how you collect samples. And so those are the roles that we play and different initiatives around the world need different catalysts. And that's what we set up.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Dan Arias","Good afternoon, guys, thanks. Francis just going back to the sequencing consumables outlook, is there any way you can add anything to the way in which you are thinking about the pace of Xs and HiSeq coming off? If I look at my model, the decommission number for several other quarters in 2018 was a lot lower than what we have. But it looks like it stepped in 4Q. So just wondering if you can help at all with the assumption there? An then maybe really I am curious if the beginning of the year is sort of brought any new visibility into some of the big projects that very obviously stayed on the Xs in 2018?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So we think about what we are looking for in 2019. I talked about the fact that in 2018 we were starting to catalyze the high throughput genome center. And in nearly all cases what they did was they would ramp up NovaSeq but keep their existing either X going and they were validating their work flows in NovaSeq. And so while they were using their NovaSeq and you see that in the high utilization numbers. A lot of them were maintaining parallel fleet. So one of the things that we are looking for in 2019 is to see that work flow, more of those work flows move off the Xs and HiSeq on to the NovaSeq.","And so that's the dynamic in the very large genome centers in the high throughput that you expect to see play out this year. The other dynamics I said that we are looking for this year is with that trying word if you like S Prime, S1 and S2 to really catalyze the smaller genome centers. And so that's going to be another driver that comes on line this year that should generate additional demand and activate another part of the HiSeq customer base.","Sam Samad","And if I can add one thing, Dan, as well. Decommission in the past that as we've talked about had not always been tied to necessarily the replacement cycle. And how customers are actually replacing HiSeq for NovaSeq. We've had some choppiness over the course of 2018 with regards to decommission. You are right. Q4 was a bit higher in terms of - was a higher quarter in terms of decommission. And the other thing I would remind as you well is that 75% of our HiSeq customers still have yet to take their first NovaSeq. So we do expect this upgrade cycle to be still in its early stages. And we will play out over the next quite a few quarters.","Francis deSouza","Yes. And then if could just add color on, so what would that means in terms of consumable pull through. And so what we are seeing is that customers that have both that are in that mix mode phase where they have either Xs and HiSeq with NovaSeq, they spend more in terms of consumable dollars at Illumina than the one that just have the Xs or the HiSeq. And so we are seeing the entry of NovaSeq into an environment catalyze additional sequencing activity which is obviously good news.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","Great, thanks, good afternoon, everyone. Francis, how are you thinking broadly about the oncology market here in 2019? I guess to get little specific, I believe a number of your customers should be getting very close to some FDA approval which should trigger some CMS reimbursement. So I'd love your color there and then secondly, if I read the press release correctly have you actually filed for approval for the TruSight Oncology array, excuse me, panel.","Francis deSouza","Yes. So, we've already engaged with the FDA and we recently announced that we've gotten from the FDA breakthrough device designation for the TruSight assay. And so what that means is we will get from the FDA a higher priority to get that assay through the process to get IVD clearance. What that means specifically is that they give you higher priority in queue. They dedicate a team to work with you for the application; they review your application in advance to make sure that they are comfortable with the design, the data requirement. And that as you are going through the clearance process that they will add additional resources if they need to, to get the application through the process in a speedy way.","In addition, while PMA don't always require PIA inspection, this one will not because it's a breakthrough designated product. And so it's real positive to be recognized by the FDA for this designation. So we are in process with the FDA. We will be submitting with their help to get designation. As you pointed out, there is a lot happening in oncology. And so the story of oncology and NGS over the few years was primarily a research and translational story. And now we are seeing a lot more of clinical story showed up, partially because we are seeing just more therapies on the market that require a companion NGS test. And the approval by the FDA last year of larotrectinib as the first precision oncology therapy that is solely driven by the presence of genomic biomarker is a really big step forward.","So we are seeing more therapies whether it's solely driven by genomic biomarker or like Keytruda where you going to have expansion of indication based on genomic biomarkers. So you've seen more therapy that required NGS testing. You are seeing more favorable reimbursement environment as you talked about. We had the national coverage decision earlier in the year. We've seen more private players and commercial players reimburse for NGS testing. And so we are seeing a lot of momentum buildup in terms of having oncology drive NGS testing in the clinic.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thanks, good afternoon. I was hoping you could provide some additional context into the difference we are seeing on the array consumable and service line in the quarter. You obviously have some exposure to consumer on both lines. So what was driving the underlying acceleration on the consumable side of things? And can you breakout between the two, the expectation for 2019?","Sam Samad","Yes. So in general maybe starting with 2019, as we said, we obviously haven't talked about specific customers, well, we talked about the fact that we've taken a more cautious view on the array growth and specifically the DTC growth in 2019. As Francis mentioned earlier, that's just result of our conversation, our work with our customers and the DTC space and really looking at their forecast.","With regards to 2018 and specifically regarding your question in Q4, we've talked about - I mean there are some dynamics within the quarter that we talked about before. With regards to one customer for instance going back to Q3, we had some ramp up related to instrument, some scan that they purchased from us ahead of the holiday season and then in Q4 we had some orders regarding consumables that helped the quarter. And with regard to array services in Q4, there was an expected drop with regard to the timing of array services and the samples and that we process.","So these can be choppy. These can be seasonal as we talked about in the past. And we do expect in the future that same seasonality maintain.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. So first off for Sam, just wanted to check my math. If I add up the different pieces of your Q1 outlook, I am coming up with something in the zip code of $820 million in revenue. So, first, is that right? And then secondly, you mentioned that the linearity in the quarter was more back end loaded? Is there anything that drove that you could identify the drove difference in linearity in the quarter? Thank you.","Sam Samad","So let me start with Q1, Dan. And I'll reiterate some of the comments that I made on the call. Essentially where you should look at instruments being down roughly $50 million from Q4 to Q1. With regards to sequencing consumable, we expect them to be flat to slightly increasing. And keep in mind that we did mention that were was $5 million stocking order in Q4 that was accelerated from Q1, 2019 as well. And then we talked about also arrays slightly increasing as well in the high single digit range from Q4 to Q1.","So you are little bit light on the $820 that you mentioned but obviously you can put the pieces together to come up with what Q1 looks like. And the new talked about sequencing services being roughly flat as well from Q4 to Q1. With regards to, I think you were referring to Q4 linearity when you said in the prior quarter. So really there was nothing specific about that. Usually, we do have in Q4 linearity is more tilted towards the back end of the quarter as we approach the end of the year. And that's typical in prior quarters that we've had. So I wouldn't point to anything that was unusual that that.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Massaro from Canaccord. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro","Hey, thanks for the question. Francis, I want to ask about NIPT. First, do you expect any change from ACOG as it relates to average risk NIPT? And then secondly, has your guidance for 2019 included any change? And then finally, can you give us an update on when the Harvard Pilgrim study will read out and when you might be able to drive or prove utility in that setting?","Francis deSouza","Sure. So let me start with ACOG. So, as you know, ACOG withdrew its practice mode in 640 which question the utility of averages NIPT. And I think as an industry everybody expect that a pre-cursor to them putting in a more favorable guideline in place. It's hard to predict when that happens. We haven't built in an expectation around that change into our plan. And this time lag between when that guideline changes and when you actually start to see your revenue flowing.","And so because of that we frankly haven't built in big expectation based on any ACOG changing. In terms of Harvard Pilgrim study, we should start to see data from that coming over the back half of this year. And so in that timeframe you should start to see some results come out. And then I think there was a question from Mark around the whether our guidance anticipates average risk. So that wasn't - and it doesn't, yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Daniel Brennan from UBS. Your line is open.","Daniel Brennan","Great, thanks for taking the questions. So, Francis, with the X and higher throughput HiSeq customers in the majority of which who haven't adopted NovaSeq kit, is there anything different in 2019? Whether be pricing or marketing or strategies to kind of support your 2019 kind of placement outlook? I know obviously on the low end, you are making some price adjustments in order to stimulate demand, but I am wondering more on the high end.","Francis deSouza","Yes. In the high end we are not changing the prices of S4. Obviously, there is lots of work being done by our commercial organization primarily working with our customers to plan the rollout, help them with any validation that they need. And that's the work. A lot of them as you can imagine have either bought NovaSeq, so they are very largest customers and have NovaSeq and it's really about doing the entire fleet cut over. So they will do it at various spaces at any and the customers you are talking about.","And so beyond the usual commercial engagement with those customers and as you can imagine we are close to all the very large high throughput services priors that is out there. Beyond that we are doing nothing exceptional.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam from BTIG. Your line is open.","Sung Ji Nam","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering Francis or Sam, if you might be able to comment on for micro raise, what the growth rate was for the non-consumable genomic business in 2018. And then what's embedded in our outlook for 2019?","Francis deSouza","Yes. We haven't specifically disclosed that Sung Ji but usually that is a more mature business that grows into low to mid single digit. And that's more predictable business unlike DTC where we've seen significant growth over the last two years. So I would say that's a good proxy as well for 2019. Although we haven't disclosed that specifically.","Operator","And our next question comes from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Your line is open.","Catherine Schulte","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. For the customer mix outlook for NovaSeq in 2019. Is this now much more of a HiSeq upgrade story from here or do you think you'll still get 25% to 30% of orders coming from bench top or new to sequencing customers? And then on the flow cell side you talked about S4 being the majority of NovaSeq consumables. How much mix shift are you expecting away from that in 2019 as you catalyze the lower throughput users?","Francis deSouza","Sure. What's - what the really exciting things about the NovaSeq story so far has been the 30% of NovaSeq orders that have come from new to high throughput customers. And that had surprised us on the upside and it's been incredibly resilient. If you look at our results now over almost two years now of taking orders for NovaSeq and shipping NovaSeq, it stayed around that number and so we expect that to continue in fact, if anything you can construct a story like having S Prime and having the new pricing in S1 and S2 will make NovaSeq even more accessible to customers who are new to high throughput. So I believe that number has proven to be remarkably resilient and I expect it to continue to be a strong contributor in terms of NovaSeq orders going forward.","In terms of mix going forward, the S4 customers represent some of our biggest sequencing customers. So I expect the S4 to continue to grow as we go into 2019 and beyond. But you should expect to see a bigger contribution obviously from S1 and S2 but then also from S Prime which is going to be new to the market coming out in Q1 and build its revenue base over the year.","Operator","And our last question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks. Maybe just building on that question, given the focus on the smaller labs with S Prime, price reduction on S1 and S2 further incentivizing HiSeq customers to convert over to NovaSeq. Is there potential for utilization or pull through of NovaSeq to mix down some of those lower volume users come online? I'm just trying to get a better feel for how the moving parts could impact utilization going forward on Nova?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So first I'll say that look we're going to keep our focus on the very large labs and we have teams that are dedicated just to those labs. So we're adding a focus now and we're looking to activate the smaller labs deliberately in 2019, that's an incremental focus on top of the focus that we have on the very largest lab. So it's an end.","The - there will be likely a change in the overall pull through rate for NovaSeq as these new flow cells come on the market and build up their revenue base. At this point frankly, it's too early to call what that impact will be. And that's partially why we haven't given you the pull through range yet on NovaSeq.","And so we want to see those flow cells in the market, we want to see utilization sort of normalize on them before we're able to sort of call an overall blended pull through rate on the NovaSeqs. And I know that a lot of you on the call are waiting for that and when we have that, we will certainly bring it out. But it's too early to call what the impact will be as these closeouts come onto the market.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Jacquie Ross for final remarks.","Jacquie Ross","Thank you. As a reminder a replay of this call will be available at the webcast in the Investor section of our website, as well as through the dial-in instructions contained in today's earnings release. Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our call and we look forward to our next update following the close of the first fiscal quarter.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

I am pleased to report that Q2 exceeded our financial guidance as revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million. In the Americas, revenue grew 13% versus the prior year, slightly exceeding our forecast. And Asia-Pacific revenue grew 29%, driven primarily by China, which grew 70% on the back of demand for HiSeq X, benchtop instruments from clinical customers, and array and sequencing consumables. In Europe, revenue declined 4% versus Q2 of last year, a slight miss to forecast.","We're making good progress on the action plan we enacted post the first quarter. Last quarter, we shared three areas that we're focusing on to deliver in our full year. The first area was improving our sales processes and, specifically, lessening deal complexity and ensuring the early closure of orders. We're making progress on deal structure and saw tangible results on the timing of the deal closure. As a result, this quarter's linearity was the best we've experienced since the fourth quarter of 2014.","Second, our commitment to improving the execution and outlook in EMEA. We're pleased with the early impact of the leadership and execution changes, including the now permanent appointment of Scott Thomas as Head of Sales and Paula Dowdy as the Regional General Manager. The turnaround will take time, even a bit longer than originally projected. We continue to believe the region's first half result and outlook is primarily reflective of execution challenges and not the result of changing demand or increasing competition. And we are confident in the ability of our EMEA leadership to achieve its full potential.","Our third area of focus was expense management. I am pleased to report that our expense re-planning efforts were completed during the quarter, slowing down our pace of hiring, discretionary travel, and other external spend without materially affecting our product development portfolio. This is partially reflected in our results for Q2 and fully reflected in our forecast for the year.","In addition to the progress made on these three areas of focus, our manufacturing and supply chain execution also improved. Specifically, the back order situation for arrays has now been resolved, and incremental capacity has been built to handle the increased demand. More broadly, our manufacturing and supply chain teams executed flawlessly, due in part to new leadership.","I'll now move on to an update on our markets. Our strategy to catalyze clinical markets is to deliver market-leading technologies and tailored solutions that enable customers to personalize patient care through genomics.","In oncology, this strategy has resulted in pharma partnerships to develop and bring to market custom panels, including TruSight Tumor 15, which has been launched as a research use-only and investigational use-only product, and TruSight Tumor 170, which will be launched as a research use-only product later this year.","We have also partnered with Amgen to develop a companion diagnostic test for Vectibix. The product development is complete, and we're preparing the final module of our pre-market approval application for the FDA. We expect this to be the first PMA submission based on next-generation sequencing, an exciting step towards fulfilling the promise of genomics in personalized medicine.","With our sample-to-answer solutions and technology leadership, we expect our oncology revenue to grow, even as reimbursement and regulation play out over time. For example, this quarter saw a rebound in oncology testing shipments during the second quarter, which grew at more than four times the rate of total company revenue growth although from a small base.","In NIPT, as expected, we continue to see customer shift to in-house testing on our sequencers. As a result, the number of samples running through our testing facility decreased to about 25,000. And we saw an offsetting uptick in sequencing consumables from these customers. Test fee revenue paid by customers to access the NIPT IP pool grew 90% year-over-year.","We gained further traction in driving NIPT penetration in China as sample volumes accelerate and are on pace to double year-on-year. With the launch of our CE-IVD VeriSeq NIPT assay in Europe late this year, we expect to see a further acceleration in that region. The launch of this product will be well-timed given the Dutch Health Council's recent endorsement of NIPT for all pregnancies.","Focusing now on new products. Orders placed across our high-throughput instrument portfolio increased sequentially and shipments were roughly flat. HiSeq X orders exceeded our guidance range and we added three new customers, bringing the total to 34. Again, this quarter demand came from new customers preparing to take part in the China PMI program, which has now allocated funding to more than 60 projects over the next 3 years to 5 years. In fact, Chinese customers drove the majority of our HiSeq X shipments in the quarter. Going forward, our HiSeq X outlook remains robust at 20 instrument to 30 instrument orders per quarter and we expect to see an increase in HiSeq placements in the Americas during the latter part of this year, which is supported by a solid pipeline.","Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, driven by ramping interest in MiniSeq, NextSeq adoption for NIPT in the U.S. and China and lower than expected cannibalization of MiSeq. Additionally, during the quarter, we received two regulatory approvals for our MiSeqDx instrument from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety in South Korea and from the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. These regulatory milestones will enable our customers to use our NGS technology in a clinical setting and are examples of how our regulatory strategy is enabling markets globally.","Microarrays were, again, a bright spot as our revenue grew 30% year-over-year driven by both consumables and services, which resulted in the highest quarter of array shipments since 2011. There were two main drivers to this result, the direct-to-consumer market, which grew more than 100%, and medical research in bio-banking customers. Additionally, array orders grew more than 60% year-over-year due to orders for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, and Infinium XT product family, both of which will launch in the second half.","Given strong orders in the last two quarters, our outlook for arrays for the year is much more optimistic. The impact of these products, coupled with a strong first-half result is expected to lead to double-digit array growth this year, which is clearly a turnaround for this business.","Before closing, I would like to thank Jay for his 17 incredible years as CEO of Illumina. Through his vision, leadership, and determination, Jay led our company from a San Diego startup to a global market leader with over $2 billion in revenue, powering the genomics revolution. I look forward to partnering with him in his new role as Executive Chairman to further our mission of improving human health through unlocking the power of the genome.","Today, we're still at the beginning of realizing the impact genomics will have in human health. As we march towards our mission, our top priority is to continue to deliver breakthrough products that enable the adoption of genomics in large and unpenetrated markets. Innovation has always been and will always be one of our core values, and a core part of our culture. And as the saying goes, culture eats strategy for breakfast, and I am committed to fostering our strong culture as we scale.","I'm also focused on scaling the organization, our infrastructure, process, and our people. Taking on some of the world's hardest problems requires the world's best team. We have an incredibly talented team, and are seeing the benefit of continuing to strengthen the organization. I'm excited about the pipeline of talent being pursued across the company. From an operational perspective, I'm focused on simplifying our business and focusing our resources on activities that will have the greatest impact. It is important that we stop doing things that don't matter.","So, these are some of my early priorities in the new role. At Illumina, we are passionate about making this great company even greater. The second quarter was a positive step along this path, but we have more work to do, as we continue to execute in our mission.","I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our second quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Thanks, Francis. As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $600 million, slightly exceeding our quarterly guidance. This result was driven by growth in sequencing consumables, and strong demand from microarrays. Instrument revenue declined 19% year-over-year to $126 million, primarily due to a challenging HiSeq comparison, given the 3000 and 4000 launch in the prior year. Sequentially, instruments grew 7%, primarily driven by our benchtop portfolio.","As predicted, HiSeq instruments were roughly flat sequentially, and we continue to expect to see an uptick in the second half, primarily Q4 in the Americas, as Francis mentioned. Consumable revenue represented 63% of total revenue to equal $379 million, an increase of 25% compared to the second quarter of 2015, driven by strength in both the array and sequencing product lines.","Sequencing consumables revenue also grew 25% year-over-year to approximately $310 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments, and particular strength in NextSeq consumables. Again, this quarter, NextSeq utilization was above our guidance range of $100,000 to $125,000 per instrument annually. As a result of this outperformance and our increasing forecast, we are now projecting annual pull-through of $100,000 to $150,000 per NextSeq instrument.","MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000, and HiSeq pull-through per instrument fell within the guidance range of $300,000 to $350,000. For modeling purposes, we removed approximately 45 HiSeqs from our installed base in the second quarter, reflecting the units taken offline due to adoption of newer machines.","HiSeq X utilization fell just shy of our pull-through guidance range, as a large customer continues to work down inventory as we have previously shared. On a four-quarter rolling basis, which normalizes for the impact of shipment timing, X utilization was within our range of $650,000 to $700,000. Given customer ship schedules and the relative size of the installed base, we are widening the guidance range to $625,000 to $725,000 annually per instrument.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 18% versus Q2 2015 to $90 million. This improvement was driven by maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base and genotyping services, partially offset by a decline in NIPT service revenue, given customers migrating to in-house testing as expected.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina's stockholders.","Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.8%, a sequential increase of 110 basis points, driven by an improvement in sequencing consumable margin and favorable microarray pricing. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margin expanded 40 basis points, primarily due to higher consumables mix, partially offset by lower services margin.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 19% of revenue, including $8.6 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $113 million or 19.8% of revenue in the first quarter. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $127 million or 21.2% of revenue, including $6.5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $125 million or 21.9% of revenue in Q1.","Adjusted operating margins were 32.6% compared to 30.1% in the first quarter, driven by an increase in revenue, gross margin expansion, and our operating expense replan. Operating margin was lower compared to the 37.4% reported in the second quarter of last year due to increased investment in head count, GRAIL, and Helix. Core Illumina operating margin adjusted for expenses associated with GRAIL and Helix was approximately 35% in the second quarter. Stock-based compensation expense equaled $32 million. In the second half, we expect to see an increase in this expense driven by a number of key hires and the annual employee equity grants in Q4.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.7% compared to 28.9% in the second quarter of last year and non-GAAP net income was $127 million. This resulted in Q2 non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, better than expected due to higher revenue and lower expenses compared to our forecast. This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the second quarter of 2015.","Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.06 and $0.02 of dilution in GRAIL and Helix, respectively. We reported second quarter GAAP net income of $120 million and EPS of $0.82 per diluted share compared to net income of $102 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year period.","I'm pleased to announce that late in the quarter we completed our plan to enter into a common to preferred share exchange transaction related to our shareholding in GRAIL. As a result, our GAAP diluted EPS included $0.01 benefit from the exchange and while Q2 net income reflected approximately 90% of the GRAIL losses, going forward net income will include approximately 50% of GRAIL losses, which is more in-line with our ownership.","Cash flow from operations equaled $217 million. Q2 DSO totaled 56 days compared to 64 days last quarter. This return to pre-SAP levels was driven by continued process enhancements, focused collection efforts, and improved linearity in the quarter. Q3 linearity is expected to drive an uptick in DSO, given the summer vacation season. Inventory rose to $311 million due to the continued build-up of consumable safety stock to enhance our supply chain performance. This increase in inventory is expected to continue into the second half of the year, as we build safety stocks in preparation for the relocation of our San Diego reagent manufacturing to our new building on the headquarters campus.","Capital expenditures in Q2 were $68 million, and we reported an additional $75 million increase in property and equipment related to construction expenditures paid for by our landlord, and capitalized by us under build-to-suit lease accounting. Consequently, Q2 free cash flow was $149 million.","During the quarter, we repurchased $100 million of common stock under the previously announced discretionary program and ended the quarter with approximately $1.43 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. We have approximately $155 million of repurchase authorization remaining, of which $70 million is discretionary.","Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016. We continue to project total company revenue growth of approximately 12% year-over-year. Included in this projection is the expectation that EMEA will experience a slower pace of recovery, which will be offset by an improved outlook in Asia-Pacific.","We are forecasting Q3 revenue of $625 million to $630 million and are anticipating high year-over-year growth in Q4 than in Q3. We have increased our non-GAAP EPS guidance to $3.48 to $3.50, up from $3.35 to $3.45 given our outperformance in Q2.","In conclusion, I would like to punctuate a number of key fundamental performance indicators related to the second quarter results. Firstly, we experienced robust sequencing and array consumable growth. Secondly, we saw strong growth in oncology testing shipments, up more than 45%.","Thirdly, Asia-Pacific outperformed significantly, and we saw strong Americas performance, offsetting underperformance in EMEA. We finally \u2013 we completed our expense replan and saw better than expected non-GAAP EPS. We believe these fundamentals will enable accelerating growth through 2016. Execution continues to be a major imperative, and our teams are focused on rebuilding growth in Europe, while continuing the strong performance in the other regions.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we will now open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Francis, can you maybe just elaborate on your comment on the European recovery being a little bit slower? I'm just wondering if that's a function of incremental steps you have to take. And obviously, with Brexit, any thoughts on whether there is any impact to GeL (20:09) funding?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. The action plan we put in place at the beginning of Q2 is playing out. We have new leadership out in EMEA, as Scott is now the permanent Head of Sales there. Paula is the new Regional GM. And when Scott first went out there at the beginning of Q2, we asked him to look through the pipeline and validate the strength of that pipeline.","And his response and in his report back to us was that the deals in the pipeline are real. Those are real opportunities for us. And three months in, those are real. And, in fact, we've added to the pipeline. What we are finding, though, is that there are some big deals in that pipeline that are taking a little bit longer to close. So, in Q2, we had a couple of those deals that slipped out of Q2, resulting in EMEA coming in slightly short of the forecast. And so, what we've done looking forward is we've looked at all these big binary deals in the pipeline and we've done a probability weighting on those deals and so that's caused us to take back a little bit our forecast for the year in EMEA.","Now that's been offset by strength that we've been seeing in the Americas and APAC and so that's the commentary. The dynamics we're seeing in the market are still strong and the issues I'm talking about are primarily our own internal issues that we're working through. The demand environment seems strong. We talked about the fact that the Dutch Health Council has approved or endorsed NIPT for all pregnancies, the research environment seems stable.","The Brexit impact hasn't really shown up yet. And so it didn't really impact us for Q2. There have been some anecdotes of \u2013 a couple of instances where it showed up, for example, we've had a couple of research teams that were questioning whether they should include collaborators, PIs, in the U.K. on their collaborations. And we expect those kinds of conversations could possibly slowdown some deals but we expect those deals to go forward anyway.","We've also had one case where a customer, because of the exchange rate volatility, wanted us \u2013 wanted to pay us quarterly rather than annually. And so, really we're seeing pretty minimal impact at this point from Brexit on our business. We're also not seeing any change in the competitive environment in EMEA.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","So, Tycho, just to punctuate a point on that, the Brexit point, our current guidance and forecast, therefore, assumes business as usual in EMEA and in the U.K. And any Brexit impacts which are too premature to figure out are not included in that forecast. GeL (22:55), specifically, we don't see any potential impact to GeL (22:58), but, again, it's a little premature to be able to tell if Brexit is going to impact that project at all, but we don't think so.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow up for the China PMI placement, can you maybe just talk about how you think about the cadence maybe over the next few quarters? Are you seeing the bulk of demand in the near-term here and then it will kind of drop off a bit?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","We are, as we said already, starting to see demand flow from the China PMI initiative. We talked about the fact that in Q2 the majority of our X placements were to China based on anticipated Chinese PMI work. We have a strong pipeline looking forward so I continue to see that strength play out over the coming quarters. And then we expect to see revenues show up from the pull-through associated with the instruments we're placing.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Thanks, Tycho.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you and good afternoon. Sequencing instruments were up against the most difficult comparison of the year. So a pretty material decline in instrument revenue. I believe, was expected in most models. For example, we were expecting a 19% decline year-over-year. That being said, based on the e-mails I am getting from investors, it does seem like that 21% year-over-year decline in sequencing instrument revenue is jumping out at folks.","I believe you indicated that benchtops were better than expected. HiSeq 2500 and HiSeq 4000s were about flat sequentially and that you exceeded the guidance range for HiSeq X orders in the quarter. It would be helpful if you could just provide any additional color on how sequencing instrument revenue performance was relative to Q1, how it came in relative to your internal expectations, and maybe discuss any dynamics such as book-to-bill that will help us assess demand momentum heading into the second half.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Doug. So, overall, we are where we expected to be generally with the instruments. We knew this was going to be a tough compare. And if you look at breakdowns of our instrument line for the HiSeqs, for example, we saw stabilization in the HiSeq instrument shipments in the second quarter. Orders were higher sequentially, and shipments were roughly flat compared to the first quarter. This was in line with what we outlined in the Q1 earnings call.","And then, if you go to the X line, we continue to be happy with the strength of the X orders, which are as we expected it to be. And as we look at the pipeline going forward, we expect that to continue. If we look at the back half of the year, we expect to see further strength, especially in the HiSeq line, as we get towards the end of the year and primarily coming out of the U.S. We have a good line of sight into our pipeline for the HiSeq instrument sales towards the end of the year, driven by end of the year budget flush we expect to see.","In terms of book-to-bill, it was sort of roughly consistent with where it's always been, which means that orders and shipments were sort of roughly in line.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah. And in terms of backlog, I mean, given the commentary on X, obviously we built backlog in that particular area. But I'd say, across the rest of the instruments, it was pretty normal book-to-ship type of ratios.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That's really helpful. I guess another question, just recognizing that some have vocally argued that demand for complex genetic tools is poised to decline and that there is overcapacity in the market. That's been out there for a little bit and the argument's become a bit more pointed subsequent to a series of recent quarters where Illumina hasn't performed up to Street expectations.","This was a good quarter, albeit against a fairly low bar. Recognizing those arguments and keeping in mind some of the progress you've made here, I want to give you an opportunity to address these concerns directly. And specifically would you be willing to comment on how confident you are at this point that the challenges you faced over the past few quarters are a function of company-specific issues versus exogenous factors. Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Doug. Obviously that's \u2013 you've covered a lot of ground and those are areas we spend a lot of time thinking through. We have been asked about certainly in the clinical markets, people have asked about, as you pointed out, the demand environment for complex genetic testing. And as we look through the data we have and the results we announced, we really don't see any dampening of the demand. Neither in the reproductive health markets, so, NIPT specifically, nor in oncology. In NIPT, we, overall, saw a continued growth in the number of NIPT samples. The dynamic playing out there is as we expected and we've noted before, we are seeing more of our big customers start to take the testing in-house. And so that results in a decline in our test send out revenue for NIPT but we see a commensurate increase in the sequencing consumables that we get from those customers.","In addition, we saw really strong growth in the test fees that NIPT customers pay to access the IP associated with NIPT. So we continue to see strong demand and a growth in samples. And if you look at some of the market dynamics playing out, we expect that demand to continue to increase. We're still in the U.S. only about 26% of covered lives that are covered for NIPT and we expect that to increase over time. And we expect to see other markets come online like we saw in the Netherlands. So we believe that there is a strong demand environment and headroom in the NIPT space.","In oncology, as we pointed out, we saw really strong growth of 45% year-on-year in oncology testing. And we know, from a market perspective, we're still at the very early stages of every tumor being sequenced for example. And so we expect to continue to see strong demand growing from both those clinical markets.","As we look at capacity and utilization, we've done a lot of work to try and understand what the impact of putting more capacity into the market has done in terms of utilization. And last quarter we put out analysis to show what happens as every quarter we put more capacity in the market, what happens to the utilization of our instruments.","And we saw that the capacity utilization has remained roughly flat and slightly gone up. And as we've updated that data for this quarter, we saw that play out again. We saw both an increase in capacity in the market, as we put out more instruments, and we saw the utilization slightly tick up as well. And so, we feel confident that even as we put out more capacity into the market, there is demand for that capacity.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you. Marc, what are you seeing at the tail end of the HiSeq X customer segment in terms of pull-through? I mean, are you starting to see some of the folks there take their utilization up? And then, I guess, along those lines, Francis mentioned consumables pull-through on the China placements. So I guess, how quickly would you expect those instruments to ramp in terms of utilization?","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah. So, Dan, we continue to see the entire \u2013 it's why we have this nice analysis we do of every customer because there is not a huge number and their pull-through. And it's not quite a straight line but you've got every single potential level of pull-through there from those that are very low to those that are very high.","Notwithstanding the one kind of customer inventory situation that has impacted us for the last three quarters, I'd say, it's pretty good. And as new customers come onboard, they drag the number down, but existing customers increase their utilization and takes it back up. And so, it's working out pretty well.","On the China situation, specifically, I would expect that to normally be a headwind as to the utilization rate, as the number of instruments gets placed and the projects come at a slower pace than you might normally expect. But on the other hand, we're still seeing those high-end customers increase. So I would expect them to offset that and so stay within this new range that we provided.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just a question on oncology, specifically, on the consumables pull-through for the systems that you've placed. Is the usage or the order consistency there any different than you find for the rest of the business, if we're just trying to understand how visibility tracks once the placement itself has been made?","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah. I think I can take that, if you like. Again, it varies a lot by customer and by application and what they're doing. We see \u2013 we do have some that are running very, very high and some in the lower end. So I think it's hard to put any kind of specific pattern on it, Dan. I think it follows the same kind of pattern we see across the high throughput instruments in general.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and it follows the same pattern as we see in other domains. So that distribution, as Marc said, of the high-end customers that have high utilization all the way down to much smaller occasionally-used instruments.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Hi, Derik.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I've got a couple of questions, a multi-parter on the oncology market. So, I guess, the first question is, could you talk a little about the 45% growth. Was that \u2013 what was boxes versus test and was that all consumables, I guess is the first question.","The second question is, obviously, the reimbursement landscape is very complicated for next-generation sequencing-based test. What are you hearing in the market about trying to drive higher reimbursement rates for NGS test? What are your customers doing along those lines? And then I've got a follow-up on that.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So what we are seeing in the oncology market is that a lot of the growth in oncology is driven by a number of the higher end customers and they are both consuming more consumables and buying more instruments. And so, while the overall sort of distribution in the oncology market maps the other markets, we definitely do have a set of very large customers that are running at high utilization and are driving a disproportionate percentage of the growth in revenue in that space. And, sorry, what was the other part of our question?","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A question on the reimbursement landscape. I guess what are your customers doing in terms of trying to get a higher reimbursement rate from CMS and just trying to get paid for what they're doing?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. A lot of the growth we're seeing today is not driven by any reimbursement, as you know. So it's either a self-pay market or it's a large cancer centers that are offering these genomics tests as part of their strategy of differentiating from other cancer centers. We are seeing some panels sort of go through reimbursement, but we're still at the very early stages of that process. We're still in the stage of the market where we're seeing a proliferation of panels, I think at last count there were over 1,000 panels out there. And so, as we look forward, I think, the next step in the process is to start to see some consolidation in the number of panels, which we think will accelerate the reimbursement in oncology.","We've also \u2013 we're also in the stage now where we're starting to submit our PMA for our test for Vectibix, and that will be covered under a reimbursement schedule. But we're still at the early stages of reimbursement in oncology.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Congratulations on a solid quarter. Francis, can you \u2013 notwithstanding your own new role and Marc's new role, you've highlighted new leadership in Europe. I think you mentioned new leadership in supply chain that you thought was paying off.","Could you maybe just give us a sense as to how you're feeling about the current leadership at Illumina or the other changes that you think or certain areas that you like to strengthen or just maybe give us your overall thought on where you stand there?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I'll start by saying that we are incredibly fortunate, here at Illumina, to have an incredibly talented leadership team and incredibly talented team as a whole. We have \u2013 I think most of you know Marc, and over time you'll get to know the rest of the leadership team, but we have a team that's deeply experienced in this space and incredibly talented.","So we're starting with a very strong base of leaders. As we grow, though, both in scale and as we grow in geographies and in new areas, we have needed to expand our leadership team. In some areas, we've needed to add specific expertise. So for example, we did the acquisition of Myraqa, brought on Mya and expanded \u2013 and are still expanding our regulatory team, for example, globally.","The scale of our business over the last few years has grown significantly. And so, in the last couple of years, we've had to strengthen our supply chain team, bringing in a new leader, our consumables manufacturing team bringing in another new leader, and so, strengthening both the team and then the infrastructure associated with the operations there.","There are a number of roles that we are looking to hire across the company but then, especially, on the leadership team. So we're looking for roles like the Head of Oncology, the Chief Medical Officer, and we're looking to expand our team that helps our customers with market access and reimbursement, for example.","And so, I'll say, look, we are starting with an incredibly strong team. But we are also scaling the business. And so, we're looking to strengthen that team.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up just has to do a little bit with guidance. I think you mentioned \u2013 maybe it's kind of two parts here, but I think you mentioned, one, a little bit of a shift in how you were thinking of forecasting Europe, which is now more probability adjusted, is that unique to Europe, or is that something you do across geographies? And then the second part of it is, I think you also highlighted the growth in the consumer segment and the arrays in particular and I am just \u2013 as Helix gets going, I'm just curious how you're thinking about managing the potential for channel conflict in an area like your consumer initiative. Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So let's talk about both. In terms of our guidance for the year, the reason we feel confident with 12%, even though I said that, look, we're looking at the big deals in Europe and applying sort of a probability-based view on them, is that we are seeing slightly stronger than expected pipelines coming out of both, the Americas and \u2013 forecast coming out both the Americas and Asia. We, in general, do apply some probability weighting to deals across the globe but we have leaders that have been in place longer in EMEA and in APAC, and so we feel like we have a much better handle on where those deals are and what their likelihood of closing is.","We applied a little bit of a heavier weighting \u2013 probability weighting in Europe than we do right now in the Americas and in APAC until we have the team on the ground and have some track record behind us in terms of the forecasting there. But the strength in EMEA \u2013 and the strength in Asia and Americas, sort of more than compensate for that from our perspective.","In terms of Helix and the consumer business, so the way we set Helix up is that Helix goes out and recruits direct-to-consumer businesses to build on the Helix platform. The intent is that anybody who is looking to set up a direct-to-consumer genomics business will go talk to Helix. And there are incredibly compelling reasons about why you would want to go to Helix and get set up with Helix, rather than set up your own sequencing lab environment, your own informatics pipeline, your own operations.","If, however, a customer feels like Helix is not the right fit for them, then they can certainly buy from us equipment and consumables. We do have customers that are outside Helix that are direct-to-consumer. They are terrific customers and we're going to continue to support them going forward.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","And, Jon, I don't think there's really any direct channel conflict because of the segmentation. Customers that have an array-based genotyping panel that they want to continue with, clearly, we can service that. But if any customer who wants to take advantage of not just the infrastructure point that Francis made but also the opportunity to do exome plus would clearly be directed to Helix. So it's segmented based on the actual product.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, everyone. So it seems like, obviously, the momentum in China has been quite good. It's a market, obviously, you've been in for quite a while, and they've been a dominant sequencing power for some time.","Can you give us a bit of color on some of the emerging players that are obviously incremental X customers? I mean, these are not household names for us, and it's hard to sort of judge where they are playing, what types of businesses they are, are they all government-funded or some private, how much of it is coming and fueled by sort of the PMI money that has been talked about? Just put some color around sort of the emergence there, given it seems like an important sort of part of your business.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good question because China is emerging as one of our top country markets already and is driving strong growth for us. If we look at the dynamics play out in that market, the market in China is primarily a clinical market. And so, we look at where the demand is coming from. There is a lot of demand from customers looking to set up NIPT operations in China. We expected that to continue to be a growing segment for us.","We're also seeing some of those customers also enter the oncology space, but we're also seeing pure-play oncology providers that are emerging as customers of ours. By and large, these are private companies. They're not necessarily government entities that are being formed to go after those market opportunities.","In the last \u2013 sort of in the recent past, we have now seen the emergence of organizations that, in some cases, are primarily targeting work coming out of the Chinese PMI. And those are the customers that are driving some of the X demand that we are seeing.","The oncology and NIPT customers are more likely to be buying the NextSeq from us, for example. And so we're seeing sort of this new segment emerge around customers that are targeting projects from the Chinese PMI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. And just as we think about product development and tiering and the like, over the last number of years, the demand from the client base has kind of been obvious and you've obviously segmented the business quite sensibly and you have instruments in most ends of the market. When you have discussions now on sort of future launches and\/or areas for expansion or for areas where the customer demands product development, how have those conversations changed? And is it more on the application side? Is it more still on footprint? Is it on speed? Is it on cost? Where do you still get the biggest push in terms of what the customer base, where they really want you to take the technology from a roadmap perspective?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","That question is a great one, because right now we are seeing, as our business sort of expands, we're getting requests across the board. There are still segments of the market that want to continue to see us drive the costs of sequencing down, drive the throughput up, shortened turnaround time, and so there is still an elasticity in the market that customers want us to enable them to access. And so, clearly, a part of our portfolio is always going to be around delivering the world's best sequencing offering.","We're getting, though, requests from customers that are saying that that's not the whole problem for them. Increasingly, we're seeing some of our clinical customers ask us to focus on helping them, for example, on the clinical reporting side. And so, as we look to how we want to evolve our portfolio over time, there are segments of the market where we're looking to provide the complete sort of sample-to-answer solution all the way down to potentially a validated clinical report.","And so, for some segments, that's going to be the key enabling component of that segment. And then in a bunch of cases, the enablers are things that we can influence indirectly. And so working with the regulators, working with the payers on reimbursement, driving the data needed to demonstrate analytical clinical validity and clinical utility, so those are things that are enabling to the market that are not maybe directly driving our business today but an area where we feel we can be productively involved to help catalyze certain markets. So, as our business has gotten bigger, there are a number of strategic levers that we're focused on to drive the adoption of genomics in the various markets we're in.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. I just had a couple of questions on the HiSeq X franchise, specifically longer-term. So, first, you made the comment around the 20 to 30 orders, which has been pretty consistent. But if you take the puts and takes between sort of the limitations on whole genome sequencing versus obviously some positive funding dynamics there, do you think that there is enough demand to carry that cadence of orders through or just beyond 2016?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. If we look at what's driving that business, with all the puts and takes but some of the dynamics like the Chinese PMI that we said really drove a significant chunk of the X demand. We expect, net-net, those dynamics to be positive exiting 2016 and to continue to sort of drive that level of orders, as we exit the year.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then just a same kind of question on the consumables side. So, obviously, you talked quite a bit about the utilization and you have the installed base sort of aging issue. But thinking about, again, sort of in the next 12 months to 24 months and the cadence of per box usage increases excluding some of the inventory dynamics you talked about and whatnot, is there anything that you can point to that might accelerate that line, thinking again about funding or anything else on the table there?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","As we look forward, I think that we feel that the pull-throughs will remain in the ranges that we talked about. As we look at the instruments we've placed, so we have new instruments that are coming online and those obviously will take a little while to ramp-up depending on which instrument you're buying. But we're also seeing instruments that are moving towards the high-end of the utilization across our portfolio.","And so, I expect that range to be fairly stable going forward. I guess the only caveat that we talked about is that there is some volatility associated with the X pull-through depending on how a single order coming in a quarter can move that number one way or another. And so we expanded the range a little bit, but other than that we expect those ranges to stay stable.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Amanda, you specifically expressed a couple of year timeframe. I think if you think out beyond that, the only potential dynamic that could move in the positive direction would be population sequencing projects layering on top of each other. But that's not in the timeframe you specified.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","First question is, just on the raised expectations for the Asia-Pacific region, this is certainly consistent with our diligence around China. I was hoping maybe you could spend a few minutes addressing Japan. It's obviously been a bit of a challenging geography here for several quarters.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. During the quarter, we actually did see the revenue from Japan increase slightly compared to the prior year, but we still think that \u2013 I'll start with saying Japan is not a big part of our revenue today. I think it's about 3% of our revenue today. So it's a small part of our revenue and it's unlikely to really move the needle one way or another. We see a gradual strengthening of the environment there but it is gradual.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Understood. And then just looking at the segment results here, and I guess, specifically a comment at the end of your prepared remarks about double-digit array guidance, but we kept the overall revenue guidance the same. And so, how should we think about the offset here? It's obviously in sequencing. Is it specific to Europe? A little color would be great. Thank you.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah, Bill, so, obviously, we've don't guide to specific levels generally \u2013 specific segments generally, but we feel that given the trend that we're seeing now in arrays, we would give that perspective to you, that double-digit. We've been seeing that start to form. We mentioned it last quarter. We said it was an emerging bright spot, but we needed to see a little bit more of a trend. With the orders that we saw last quarter and the quarter before and the products this year, we had already been contemplating this potential array growth. We just didn't want to provide a number until we felt more comfortable. So it doesn't really change our guidance. And it doesn't offset necessarily on the sequencing side, it's been contemplated for... (51:31).","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Okay. I appreciate the color there. Thanks, Marc.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I want to ask a first question on the instrument business and then a follow-up on GRAIL. On the instrument business, just putting together some of the comments here on the call, and I was looking back for history, a little bit of context, you've had a couple of huge product cycles the last five years or six years with the HiSeq family. And just wondering how you think about the high-end of the instrument market being a growth driver if we take a long-term view. Is it really about driving new innovation at the high-end or should we assume that as we think about where this market is going from a clinical standpoint that it's going to be really more about driving lower-end instruments, maybe a lower ASP that reaches out to the clinical market. Just trying to think about how you look at driving growth in sequencing instruments?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think there are a few parts to how we think growth is going to come out of the instrument market. One is \u2013 and we've seen this before \u2013 one of the big drivers of growth there is the upgrade cycle. And if you look at our entire portfolio, over time, each of those instruments needs to be upgraded. And whenever we can drive a big upgrade cycle, that contributes to growth.","Now, in previous years where we've had one instrument, you would have a single big upgrade cycle that would drive a lot of growth. Clearly now, we have a much bigger portfolio, and so while any one upgrade cycle will drive growth, that will play out over multiple instruments rather than a single big upgrade cycle.","There is, we believe, opportunity \u2013 further opportunity in placing clinical boxes. And so, you'll see us continue to look to get clearance in the various markets around the world. We are very optimistic on the clinical market being a driver of purchases of \u2013 new purchase of our instruments.","And then, in the longer-term, we do expect to see the low-end of the market to drive instrument growth. And so we talked about Firefly and the instrument we are launching at the end of next year. We believe that there are a number of segments that will be new to sequencing that will be opened up by Firefly.","So there are tens of thousands of labs, for example, around the world that the vast, vast majority of which don't use sequencing at all, and they are capital constrained and, in some cases, they are sample constrained so that a purchase of even a MiniSeq or a MiSeq really doesn't make sense for them today. But Firefly would be perfect for that market.","So we see a number of markets that we think a low-end sequencer would be very attractive for. And that would all be incremental instrument revenue.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It's helpful. And just to follow up on GRAIL, just looking for any update you could give us in terms of key milestones for that program over the balance of 2016 or next 12 months? Just sort of looking at the next 6 month and 12 month timeframe in terms of what we should expect in terms of progress from that program? Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. The GRAIL team is making really good progress. They continue to build out their team. So, as you remember, a nucleus of people moved over from Illumina to GRAIL. And that team has done a really good job adding really world-class talent in addition to that team. They've made really good progress and are continuing to make good progress in developing the assay and are on track to have that done by the end of this year. And the team is hard at work on designing their clinical trial. We don't have any new updates to provide right now and we'll make sure to get it out as we do.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks. I wanted to start and ask about NIPT. Could you walk us through some of the moving parts with the insourcing from customers and how that \u2013 plus the IP pool impacted both revenue and maybe gross margin in the quarter?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So the way that market is playing out is, in a number of cases what we do is when we signup a new customer, we allow them to market their services even before they have their lab set up and we will process the samples for them in our CLIA lab. And for that, we charge them a test send-out fee and that drives test send-out revenue for us. That's good revenue but it really sort of on-ramp for them to have their own lab. And so, while we are processing their samples, a lot of these customers are actively building out their own lab and, over time, the intent is to move the samples from being processed by us to being run by the customers themselves in their own labs. To do that, they obviously have to buy instruments as well as consumables from us and so that's what you see playing out in that market.","In addition to instrument purchases and consumable purchases, they pay us a test fee associated with getting access to the intellectual property we have around NIPT. And so the way you see that market working then is, we'll signup a customer, you'll see a test send-out, revenue stream show up to us and, over time, that gets replaced by instrument consumable and test fees.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","And the way, Jack, that plays out in gross margin is, it generally only have an impact when we have underutilization in our services lab, which we did see a little bit of a headwind for that this quarter, as customers migrated the test to in-house and we have overcapacity for a while which takes us a little while to fill and, therefore, under-observation of overhead. And that's where you see a little gross margin headwind but it's not that significant this quarter.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Understood. That's helpful. And then just one more, Francis, I appreciate some of the commentary you made around the cost initiatives this quarter. We can back into what core Illumina is doing on both SG&A and R&D. I'm just curious, could you give us a little bit more granularity on how both the GRAIL, Helix portion you expect that to ramp through year-end and then what a sustainable rate looks like for that and then maybe even what the implied core Illumina looks like? That would be very helpful. Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll happily take that one as well. I mean, they're both growing businesses. So they're both going to ramp during the rest of this year. That's partially offset by a higher non-controlling interest charge on GRAIL because of the recent restructuring of the shares. So no change there in terms of our forward-looking perspective on the dilution from Helix and GRAIL together. Trying to think, was there another part of the question?","Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury","There was a part for this year and on a go-forward basis.","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And so, on a going forward basis, we haven't provided any official guidance on that yet. Directionally, we've talked about a couple of options and we'll come back when we've completed our budgeting with more detail on that. The GRAIL and Helix are both tied into the overall Illumina budgeting cycle, and so we're starting to get into the thick of that right now.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. You said that you're expecting strong HiSeq orders in the fourth quarter and you cited that the pipeline is why you believe that you can achieve that. Where in the sales cycle do you see a lot of opportunities that give you the confidence in your pipeline?","In other words, have customers made the decision to purchase HiSeqs but are waiting for funding applications to be accepted or where are customers or, I guess, are they dragging their feet on committing to making an order?","Francis A. deSouza - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So a little bit of all of the above. Now, typically, the people buying HiSeqs are not new to Illumina customers. And so, typically, we've been working with a lot of these customers already. We understand sort of their business and the demands on their business. And that's what allows us to project when we think they'll be needing instruments and work with them on when they will need instruments.","So, in some cases, it's grant applications that are in. In some cases, it's people that are looking at their budgets for the year and using their end-of-year budgets to buy HiSeqs. In some cases, it's they're just ramping up their business, and that's when they'll need the new instruments. But in the majority of cases, these are customers that are already customers of ours and that we have been working with for a while.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. And on a similar topic, you've removed, I think, 270 HiSeqs from your installed base over the last year and a half. Do you expect the rate of instruments that are decommissioned to slow down later this year when you're expecting that pickup in the HiSeq placements?","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","I mean it doesn't \u2013 actually it doesn't really matter as long as they are replacing those older HiSeqs with newer instruments. And so, as Francis mentioned earlier, with respect to the utilization analysis we do, that we've seen an uptick in the available capacity and so that net of those reductions in older instruments. So even with that, we're seeing the capacity going up as customers buy the new higher throughput instruments. So it's probably not fruitful to try and predict where that's going because \u2013 that's my point, (1:01:12) it doesn't matter as long as it's replacement, which is generally is.","Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Flatley","","Thanks Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. Before moving on to my prepared remarks, I would like to thank Christian Henry for his contribution to investor events over the last eight years, including our earnings calls. As many of you are aware, Christian has recently transitioned into his new role as Chief Commercial Officer, and he is spending time today with customers, one of his highest priorities.","With this new role, we expect his participation in investor meetings and calls to be limited. He's passing that baton to Francis deSouza, who recently joined the team as President. Francis has met many of you already at the events we've attended this month, and we will look forward to his contribution to the Q&A section of our future earnings calls.","The fourth quarter successfully closed a spectacular year for the Company. Through our investments in 2013, we laid the foundation for a series of new products and entries into new markets. This allowed us to announce 12 new platforms and products two weeks ago, make a number of key acquisitions including NextBio, and increase the size and scope of our commercial activities.","We appointed several senior leaders, including Dr. Richard Klausner as Chief Medical Officer, Bob Ragusa as Senior Vice President of Operations, and Francis deSouza in the role of President. The re-organization we announced in October has been fully implemented, bringing improved market focus and a more balanced structure. I am exceptionally proud of what the team accomplished in 2013, and I look forward to seeing what we together with our customers can achieve in 2014.","For the past few years we've talked about diversifying our customer base, which we've measured by the percentage of shipments to commercial, non-profit, and hospital customers. I'm pleased to share that we've successfully reached this goal in the fourth quarter, as approximately 50% of shipments were to these non-traditional segments.","Funding for academic customers in the US has also improved recently, as the NIH budget is set to increase more than 3% in 2014, and we continue to see strong double-digit growth in the fraction of grants allocated to sequencing.","Turning now to specific results in Q4, our financial results were incredibly strong as we delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $387 million, as a result of positive underlying trends across all geographies and product lines.","This quarter, total microray revenue increased 10% year over year, due to growth in array consumables and instruments, as well as genotyping services. The strength in genotyping services and instruments was due in part to an increase in consumer samples.","Consumable demand was driven by a record number of Infinium samples shipped; BlueGnome's IVF portfolio of products, which grew 60% Q4 over Q4; as well as our new Onco array that began shipping in October. For the full year, arrays grew 3% as demand for consumer and IVF products reinforced the market trend toward large sample studies at lower complexity and ASP per sample.","Turning now to our sequencing business, our results clearly demonstrate the early penetration of NGS into reproductive health, oncology, and other clinical markets, and our improving competitive position. Sequencing revenue grew 32% year over year in the fourth quarter, driven by impressive demand for consumables and sequencing services. Sequencing consumables grew 37% over Q4 of last year, due to higher utilization of HiSeq instruments, and our larger install base, as well as growth in our Sample Prep business.","Q4 Sample Prep shipments grew more than 50% year over year as Nextera shipments hit a record level. Strength here was driven by demand for Nextera XT, our library prep solution for small genomes. In 2013, Sample Prep shipments grew close to 55%, and we believe there continues to be extensive opportunities for growth in this area.","Turning now to instruments, Q4 instrument revenue grew 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, as a result of demand for both sequencing and array instruments. Again this quarter, we saw significant demand for sequencing instruments, as we received orders for more than 100 HiSeqs and close to 300 MiSeqs. Shipments were lower than orders for both platforms, as demand exceeded our production capacity, but fully within normal quarter-to-quarter variation.","Two HiSeq trends that we have noted throughout 2013 were again the case in Q4. Approximately 90% of HiSeqs ordered were 2500s, and many current customers remain capacity constrained. As a result, approximately 60% of the orders in the quarter were from existing HiSeq customers, as they scaled their facilities to undertake larger projects. Of the new customers, over 40% were from commercial and hospital markets.","In the fourth quarter, we saw strong demand for MiSeq, as we continued to take share and saw solid results from the trade-in program. Our new long-read reagent kits are opening new demand for applications such as 16S sequencing. The clearance of MiSeq DX also drove demand, and we received orders for eight MiSeq DX instruments, including molecular pathology labs looking to transition current cystic fibrosis testing to NGS.","Non-academic customers again accounted for more than 50% of MiSeq orders in Q4, the vast majority of which were commercial, translational, and clinical customers. In addition to cystic fibrosis testing, many of these customers are interested in our TruSight content panels. To date, over 300 customers have purchased TruSight kits, and we believe half these customers are in the early phases of validation.","Our TruSight 1 kit has been a particular interest, as it represents the industry's broadest sequencing panel, covering over 4,800 genes associated with known clinical phenotypes. This product was launched in October, and we've already seen significant interest. Close to 70 customers have placed orders in the first few months since launch, which is the best initial market reaction we've ever seen for a targeted sequencing assay.","Moving now to FastTrack Services, our turnaround time decreased significantly, and we're now committing to delivering genomes within eight weeks of receiving samples. This turnaround time enabled us to ship more than 5,000 genomes this quarter, and new record, and more than twice the number of genomes sequenced in the prior-year period.","This quarter saw orders for more than 12,000 genomes, another new record, which included the 10,000-whole-genome order from the University of Cambridge and Genomics England, Ltd. This project is one of the first of many population projects being discussed, which we believe are going to be critical to accelerating the discovery of new associations of human variation and disease.","Additionally, with the announcement of the HiSeq X10 system, we've standardized our pricing in FastTrack Services. This pricing structure provides clarity, as sequencing on the HiSeq X10 systems is a more economical approach to whole genome sequencing than sending samples to our internal services lab. While this new pricing model is expected to result in our services business growing at a slower rate than we have seen previously, we believe customers will be motivated to run projects on their own systems.","We remain focused on delivering complete sample-to-answer workflows, enabling new markets to embrace NGS technology through a variety of applications. One component of this strategy is to focus on improving the ease of use and user experience of our Sample Prep products.","As a first step, we recently introduced our NeoPrep push-button library prep system with a radically simpler workflow to go from DNA or RNA to libraries ready for sequencing. Based on digital microfluidics technology from our ALL acquisition, NeoPrep will be available this summer offering an important step on the path to integrated sample-to-answer solutions.","Our focus on integrated solutions was reinforced with the recent launch of BaseSpace Onsite and BaseSpace Core Apps. Initial customer feedback on BaseSpace Onsite has been very positive. A number of customers have cited the simple user interface and installation as transformative to their ability to bring next-generation sequencing into their labs. BaseSpace Onsite includes access to our new Core Apps, as does the cloud version of BaseSpace.","These highly optimized apps transform sequenced data processing into a simple push-button process for the most frequently used applications, including RNASeq, exome analysis, whole genome sequencing, and tumor normal analysis. The combination of BaseSpace, BaseSpace Onsite, and NextBio serves our entire sample-to-answer workflow and are critical components of this strategy.","I'd like to briefly share some of the customer feedback on our new platform announcements. Shortly after introducing NextSeq, we embarked on a 60-city global road show to demonstrate the innovation, speed, flexibility, and simplicity of the platform. Additionally, we hosted two live webinars last week that had nearly 500 participants, a third of which were potential new customers.","Other indications of interest in NextSeq have been incredibly positive. Web traffic has easily surpassed both the MiSeq and HiSeq launches, with close to 20,000 visits to our NextSeq overview page, and 10,000 visits to our detailed NextSeq instrument selector, all in the first two days post-announcement.","Interest in the HiSeq X10 continues to be exceptional. Last week the New York Genome Center purchase the fourth X10 to support their mission of offering state-of-the-art technology to accelerate life-saving discoveries. Today I'm pleased to announce that Decode Genetics, now owned by Amgen, has purchased the fifth X10 to focus on population-scale research into the understanding of genetics and disease.","In addition to NYGC and Decode, we've spoken with many additional customers who are interested in purchasing the system. We are evaluating the extent to which we can ramp our supply chain to provide more systems this year, and will provide more information to you over the next several quarters. The demand we've seen for the $1,000-genome reinforces our view that there is, as far out as we can see, an insatiable demand for whole-genome sequencing.","In summary, over the last month, you've seen the results of our investments, commitment to innovation, and ability to move fast and embrace change. With the introduction of our new sequencing platforms and applications, we are extremely well positioned to address opportunities of every scale.","We believe we have large, untapped market opportunities, which will be enriched by the results of sequencing large populations that further unlock the clinical utility of the genome. We remain inspired by our customers for what they are accomplishing with our technology, and look forward to even greater progress in 2014. I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our fourth-quarter results.","Marc Stapley","Thanks Jay. As Jay mentioned, the fourth quarter marked another solid performance for Illumina to close out a remarkable 2013. Revenue for the year was $1.42 billion, which represents an increase of 24% over 2012, reflecting strong demand across the entire product portfolio. We posted many new records in the fourth quarter, which contributed to this strong result, including record shipments of sequencing core consumables, Sample Prep, Fast Track service genomes, and Infinium samples, all of which led to record revenue.","Fourth-quarter revenue was $387 million, an increase of 25% year over year, which included 22% organic revenue growth. The fourth quarter also marked our second-highest order quarter ever, with record orders of HiSeq 2500, near record orders of MiSeq, and orders of whole genome services being the highest we have ever booked.","Globally, demand for our products remained strong during the fourth quarter. Shipments in the Americas grew 31% year over year, and Europe saw a 19% increase over the same period. In APAC, shipments grew 28% year over year, driven by continued strength in Japan, which saw shipment growth of more than 85%, due to better-than-expected year-end funding, and demand from clinical research customers.","Instrument revenue grew 11% year over year to reach $89 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily driven by demand for sequencing instruments, and as Jay mentioned, both HiSeq and MiSeq orders exceeded shipments in the quarter. Consumable revenue in the quarter was $244 million, an increase of 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to our growing installed base, as well as higher demand for sequencing consumables and Sample Prep.","Consumable revenue represented 63% of total revenue, flat compared to the prior-year period, and higher than the 60% seen in Q3. This was primarily due to the strength in sequencing consumables, as well as instrument shipments being constrained this quarter.","Annual HiSeq pull-through per instrument was above our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000 in Q4, higher year-over-year, and up sequentially. At this time, we are not modeling a change to our projected HiSeq quarterly range, as we believe Q4 included a small amount of year-end spending, particularly in Europe. MiSeq utilization was in our annual projected quarterly range of $40,000 to $ 45,000, a range that we view as stable going forward.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts, and revenue from verified sales, grew more than 65% versus Q4 2012, to equal $51 million. This improvement was driven primarily by the ongoing growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base, an increase in genomes processed year over year, revenue from Verify, and demand for our genotyping services.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude legal contingencies, non-cash stock compensation expense, and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter reached the highest level we've seen since our entry into sequencing, at 71.4%. This compared to 70.2% in the third quarter. The sequential expansion was primarily due to a higher mix of consumables, and low warranty costs associated with the improved performance of our reagents and instruments. Year over year in Q4, gross margins expanded close to 300 basis points, as a result of higher sequencing instrument margins, a higher mix of sequencing consumables, and improved warranty costs.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $66 million, or 17% of revenue, compared to $61 million, or 17.2% of revenue in the third quarter. The sequential increase in R&D expense was primarily due to the impact of head-count additions, accrued bonuses, and the acquisition of NextBio, as well as other items related to the offshore investments in our new products.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $86 million, or 22.2% of revenue, compared to $74 million, or 20.6% of revenue, in the previous quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to commission and bonus payments arising from the year-end performance, the additional head count to support our planned commercial growth, and the acquisition of NextBio.","Adjusted operating margins were 32.3%, compared to 32.4% in the third quarter, and 33.1% reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margins were slightly lower year over year due to the impact of acquisitions, as well as increased investment in R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth.","In the fourth quarter we recognized approximately $500,000 of adjusted other income. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.6%, compared to 28.9% in the fourth quarter of last year, which included the catch-up as a result of Singapore manufacturing exceeding our full-year internal expectations in 2012.","Non-GAAP net income was $65 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.45. This compared to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $57 million and $0.42, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2012. We reported GAAP net income of $81 million, or $0.56 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, compared to $72 million, or $0.53, per diluted share in the prior-year period. Current period results include a pre-tax gain of $55 million for the sale of our minority investment in Oxford Nanopore, and $6 million recorded in cost of goods to reflect the ongoing royalty on B-chip sales associated with the Citrix litigation, plus interest.","We generated cash flow from operations of $127 million during the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $27 million, resulting in $100 million of free cash flow, a new milestone. We ended the quarter with $1.17 billion in cash and short-term investments. Q4 inventory was $154 million, lower than the third quarter despite sequential revenue growth, reflecting the constraints in sequencing instrument production. DSO decreased to 56 days, compared to 60 days last quarter, as a result of more linear shipments throughout the fourth quarter.","Turning now to our expectations for 2014, we project 15% to 17% total Company revenue growth, and non-GAAP EPS of $2 to $2.06. As outlined during our Investor Day, we expect revenue to ramp during the year, starting from the first quarter that could be flat sequentially. As a result, embedded in this guidance is an expectation for EPS growth to be slower than revenue growth in the first half, as we fully absorb the 2013 investments, including acquisitions, and the higher share count due to the increase in stock price. In the second half, we expect the rate of EPS growth to exceed the rate of revenue growth.","This guidance also includes assumptions of approximately 70% gross margin, stock-based compensation expense of $128 million, and full-year weighted average non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of $148 million, which assumes a stock price of $114. Given our outstanding warrants and convertible debt, at today's closing stock price of about $144, our non-GAAP diluted share count outstanding would be about $151 million shares.","We are projecting a full-year pro forma tax rate of 29.5%, which includes the 2014 federal R&D tax credit, which has not been enacted. If the tax credit is not passed, our tax rate would increase by more than 200 basis points. For modeling purposes, we feel it is appropriate to assume the tax credit is passed in Q4. At that time, we will record the full-year impact. Therefore, at this point we expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 32%.","In summary, 2013 was a year of solid results, but also a year where we laid the foundation for extended growth through strategic investments and acquisitions. We continue to drive the market development and adoption of the most innovative and extensive sequencing portfolio. We remain focused on building our business and our capabilities to address the approximately $20-billion market opportunity that we see ahead of us.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question plus a related follow-up, as necessary. Operator, we will now open the lines for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please proceed","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co. ","Hey, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. Maybe just starting off with the HiSeq X Ten you talked about potential additional demand here. Can you maybe talk to how quickly you think you could ramp production? And as you talk to some initial customers any early thoughts on consumable pull through? I mean we're kind of picking in the range of 1 million to 1.2 million but just curious on your thoughts.","Jay Flatley","Well, we\u2019ve talked to lots of customers about it, so the interest has been extremely high. We are evaluating right now what our supply chain looks like and there\u2019s as I mentioned previously two key components that we're watching most carefully. ","One is the supply of cameras, which is an outsourced item. We're feeling like we\u2019ll be able to pull some of those in. ","The second is the internal production of our pattern flow cells, and this is in early stages of manufacturing. So we actually won't know probably fir at least a quarter how fast we can ramp those and clearly on any new production item of this complexity, there is some initial yield considerations that we have to take into account. ","So we're monitoring all of those factors and we think within the next one to two quarters, we will have a lot more information about what we\u2019d be able to produce in the back half. ","In terms of reagent consumption, the numbers you cited are sort of the theoretical numbers that someone could consume. We don't actually know what any actuals might be. Customers haven't given us any specific guidance on what they plan to do, but I think it's relatively safe to assume that customers aren't going to pay $10 million for a system like this and then only use it half time. So we expect the utilization rates on average to be relatively high.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co. ","And then do you feel like they're prepared to deal with the backend Informatics I mean if they're pulling up 18,000 genomes per year per cluster, how do they handle the backend data analysis?","","Jay Flatley ","Well, that's actually one of the criteria that we're using for making sure these customers are qualified is that we\u2019re working with them to be sure that they have that capability. And if they don't, which would probably be customers beyond the initial five, then we would be prepared to help them with either BaseSpace or BaseSpace Onsite potentially connected with NextBio as well. But customers who don't have that kind of capability would tend to not be in the initial set of systems that we would sell.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co. ","Okay and just last follow-up, you talked about soliciting additional customer feedback on NextSeq can you talk about the relative positioning versus HiSeq and MiSeq, and has anything kind of change from your initial expectations in terms of how it could cannibalize some of the other systems are not?","Jay Flatley ","No. I think the way we feel today is pretty much what we thought when we launched this that it pretty much hits a white space in the middle part of our product line between the HiSeq and the MiSeq both from a pricing perspective as well as a throughput perspective, so we think it's largely an incremental system sale. But it will cannibalize to some extent MiSeq\u2019s customers coming up and some HiSeq customers coming down. Difficult to predict exactly what that pattern will look like, and as we start getting the first initial orders, we will be able to start tracking that to know if any customers in our pipeline converted from either MiSeq or HiSeq to go to a NextSeq. So it\u2019s going to us probably a couple months to have some actual data on that.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company","Hello. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one is a quick follow-up to one of Tyco\u2019s first questions. Do you have a sense for how X Ten placements at sites that already have 2000s and\/or 2500s will impact utilization of those existing HiSeq? Do you expect that there is going to be any impact in the existing installed base at those sites or how folks are using those instruments?","Jay Flatley","There could be a bit Doug. We don't think it will be large. If you recall it in the X Ten, you can only run complete human genomes and if we look across all the samples that are run on our systems globally, we estimate that only 10% to maybe at most 15% of the samples run our whole human genomes. So most of the capacity on the 2500s is used for other applications and that will continue to be the case. ","You know clearly, there'll be some customers who are running whole genomes that will pull those on to X Tens because of the cheaper price, but our hope is that that then gives them capacity on the existing 2500s to fill it with other samples where they may have been capacity constraint.","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay. And then on the NextSeq \u2013 just curious especially within clinical and translational customers, how much of a hurdle is the use of you know essentially dark spaces as part of the two-color encoding approach? How much of a hurdle is that overcome in getting those folks to adopt the instruments and to the extent that that is a hurdle? Could you share a little bit of what your strategy is to overcome this?","Jay Flatley","Well, clearly that was a critical factor in our product develop activities over the past couple of years on the system, and we needed to ensure so quite some time ago that we could demonstrate equivalent performance with two channel chemistry as we do with four channel chemistry, and we are absolutely satisfied that we've done that. We have an outstanding data to show the correlation on RNA-based experiments , you know, R- squares of 99%. The metrics on complete human genome sequencing are essentially equivalent with what we get off the HiSeq part of the product line ,so we actually convinced ourselves that the chemistry is equivalent.","I think in a clinical setting what they care most about is the data. They care less about the underlying technology. I think in some ways our academic customers will be more intrigued by what the differences are in the potential nuances of two-channel chemistry and that will be fun to explore with them in some sense but we don't expect any pushback on this as long as the data that we can demonstrate stands up to the data that we've had in R&D and expect that to be the case.","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company","Okay and one last one \u2013 when one looks at the specs and the various sequencing products you are now marketing or about to market, it just doesn't leave a lot of white space for the existing and soon to be launched short read competitors. And you know in fact I think you could argue that you really went after those guys pretty aggressively with the new products and product enhancements. And you know I think you could argue that these also seem increasingly well suited to replace technologies beyond sequencing an existing markets. ","So I guess the question is is this the time to get even more aggressive with trade-in programs for competitive sequencers? And might it get were aggressive with programs to incentivize new customers to convert to Illumina sequencing from non-NGS approaches in the near-term?","Jay Flatley","Well, I think you\u2019ve seen us do some things that you know clearly reflect our intent to broaden the applicability of our product line both to other \u2013 to bring forward other technologies or to replace other technologies as well as to improve our competitive position. We've filled out the product line we think quite well in terms of the spectrum and instruments we have from a price and a performance perspective. The trade-in programs I mentioned in my script were very successful last quarter and particularly with 454 because that product is now obsolete product that companies \u2013 that product shut down. And we are putting in a trade in program with NextSeq as well so I think that product is suited particularly well in some portions of the market to be successful with the trade-in program and we'll see how that turns out here over the next quarter or two.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","","Derik De Bruin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Marc Stapley ","Hey there.","Jay Flatley ","Hey, Derek.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Hey. So, on your genomic services, you said you don't expect those volumes to be as strong internally going through. I guess could you just give us a little bit more color in terms of how you see that whole genome sequencing services businesses evolving over the next couple years with that? And I guess I'm sort of thinking when you go back to the X Ten how many whole human genomes to factor are going to be sequenced over the next couple of years. I'm trying to get a sense of the demand and volume for both internal and external.","Jay Flatley ","Yes. To be clear what we expect is we expect the growth rate in the services business to slowdown.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay.","Jay Flatley ","","And we think that's because there are going to be some service providers who by X10s. We think. And will have to watch who buys X10s and how fast we install them of course and whether we start offering broad service capabilities. ","If they do that and depending upon what their markup look like, they would have the ability to sequence more cheaply than what we\u2019re going to price our internal services at so that will I think re-invert the pricing model back to the way it should look and that's clearly our hope here. ","Now, there's going to be some time phasing of this because it'll take us a while to get these X10s in place and for them to develop their business and for them to ramp up and so I think we're going to continue to have a nice services businesses here. But we wanted to caution people is to not extrapolate from the 5000 number\u2026","Derik De Bruin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch"," ","Got it.","Jay Flatley ","From the 2500 to the 5000 to the 12,000 orders that we booked and to keep that curve going up at that rate and that\u2019s what the cautionary statement was about.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's what I thought, I just wanted to make sure on that. On the NeoPrep, could you just give a little bit more detail in terms of how that fits into the overall Sample Prep universe, with some of the other competing products out there either Access Array or Rainstorm, or some of the other ones out there. I'm just curious if you could talk about sort of the NeoPrep's place in the ecosystem of Sample Prep, and what assays are going to be, or what Sample Prep protocols you are going to be putting on it?","Jay Flatley","","Yes. Well, we\u2019re going to put the top six protocols on it this year, so we are going to have when it starts shipping in the summer, I think the plan is to have three or four ready right then, and then by the end of the year we'll have a couple more. That will we think hit somewhere in the range of 80% to 90% of all the Sample Prep protocols that our customers use.","The great thing about this instrument is that it's an instrument tailored for one specific task, and it does it extraordinarily well. That's why we're able to price it under $50,000, and why it can be so incredibly simple to use for our customers.","I think what it would compete with in the market place are more general-purpose instruments that necessarily have to be more complicated, we think, because they have to do a lot of different things to support diverse types of Sample Prep from other types of companies. We think it's an ideal box to fit into our product line, and is really just the beginning of what we're going to do overall in terms of integrating full sample-to-answer solutions.","Derik De Bruin \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Daniel Brennan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Thanks for taking the questions. Jay, I just wanted to go back to the Cancer Panel, which you unveiled at the recent Investor Day. Maybe can you provide a little more context on the Cancer Panel, like how is that panel going to fit into the current competitive landscape? Do you deem a certain customer segment not being served well with this? Will this accelerate growth? Maybe a little more color, trying to think about how it fits in?","Jay Flatley","","We think there's going to be multiple sub-segments of the oncology market, in terms of what the panels will look like. Rick talked a bit about two of those. One of them will be a very low complexity panel that we are referring to as the actionable genome panel. That would include only those genes that have very specific therapeutic decisions that would result from sequencing those genes. These would typically be reimbursed, and we would get that approved through the FDA. That's one part of the market that we would be going after.","I think the other part that he talked about is a panel that we will use more for companion diagnostic tests that will be used in clinical trials by pharmaceutical companies. I think there's then sort of a middle part of the market, which is where foundation medicine lives, and that's in the higher complexity panels, 240 or 250 genes I think they have on their panel. That, of course, has everything that our other panels would have plus a whole lot more, and can deal with more rare cases where you don't know exactly what you are looking for.","I think on their panel are included all the known oncogenes, plus a whole lot of other things that people speculate may be related to particular cancers. There will be some group of customers of ours in that sector that will serve that market segment. Then there'll be the customers that sequence exomes, and then those that sequence whole genomes. We sort of see a full spectrum of offerings here in the market place.","Daniel Brennan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And then one for Marc. Marc, can you talk about the guidance for this year, the top-line guidance, which certainly after the strength that you saw last year accelerating growth from commercial customers, the host of new products being launched? Any color you can provide, how we think about that 15% to 17%, which just seems to have a real conservative bias to it?","Marc Stapley","Yes, Dan, I think if you go back to the chart that I shared and also the statements I made around \u2013 we could see a slower start to the year and a ramp throughout 2014, even potentially with Q1 being flat sequentially. That's largely driven by, as I said before, the product transitions that we are going to have to go through, and seeing how those really do flesh out with our customers. Our timing, also you have the timing of the X10 installations that we're able to do, based on the constraints that we have around manufacturing those, and supply and so on.","I think if you think about that revenue growth trend and how that might look, I think you can see how we get to the 15% to 17%. We clearly have a larger range this year than we normally would in terms of internal estimates, and that's because we are in this transition year. We'll have a little bit more clarity as the quarters go on.","Daniel Brennan \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","","Thank you. The next we have comes from the line of Ross Muken of ISI Group. Please proceed.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","","Good afternoon, guys. ","Jay Flatley","Sure. ","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","I guess in all the myriad of product releases that you had, what were you most surprised with in terms of feedback from customers with the various enhancements, or new introductions, and some of the more substantial launches, whether it was around the NextSeq or the X10?","","Jay Flatley","","I'd say there was one thing that surprised me, and that is how fast customers were able to come up with $10 million to buy X10s. We knew this was going to be a very potent product, and there would be tremendous demand, meaning people who would want to have access to it if they could. What surprised me is how fast people have actually been able to push the button and move forward with this, so that's probably the standout part of this for me."," I think that it's important that NextSeq not get lost in the noise of that, because NextSeq is an incredibly important product that we think will sell in very high volumes and hits a real sweet spot in the market, particularly if you think about what's happening with NIH budgets now going up this year. For a customer who doesn't do sequencing at all it's a perfect platform, because it flexes all the way from a full human genome down to targeted panels, and it's at a beautiful price point. I think it's a really important product in the lineup.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","I guess how does the discussion go with sort of the incremental X10 customer around the glide path of where that instrument's going, whether it's if they are interested in exome or targeted, et cetera, how you're thinking about rolling out maybe incremental capabilities over time?","","Jay Flatley","","Yes. What we are telling those customers is that we currently have no plan to do anything other than whole human genomes; that clearly over time, as we begin to validate other applications on the platform and optimize the kits and the flow cells, we may decide to deploy other applications. But right now they shouldn't be buying it with that in mind. Because it's really dedicated today to whole human genomes.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","Got it. Thanks Jay.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Dan Arias of UBS. Please proceed.","Dan Arias \u2013 UBS","","Good afternoon, guys, thanks. Maybe just a quick follow-up on the X10 comments. Jay, do you guys intend to continue to take orders there if a 2015 shipment date is okay with the customer, or are you kind of taking a pause from formal bookings as you look at your capacity?","Jay Flatley","","We will continue to take orders to some point. If it gets to be \u2013 I guess it's a great problem to have, but if got so we had such a huge black backlog that we couldn't actually tell a customer when they would get a unit, then we probably would stop taking orders. But as long as we have a predictable flow of instruments and reagents, even if they might get their first system in Q4 or Q1 of next year, we would probably continue to book the orders and get them into the queue.","Dan Arias \u2013 UBS","Okay. One of the things that you didn't focus on, on Analyst Day, was Moleculo. Can you just sort of update us with what you are doing there? What we should look for in terms of potentially porting that into kit form?","Jay Flatley","","Yes, the kit development is well under way and we plan to launch that near the end of Q1 into the early part of Q2. We are on track with what we had said with respect to that kit. Remember, we always mentioned at the time we bought that, that we have other internal programs around long reads as well. Those projects and products are potentially complimentary to Moleculo, and those programs remain. Our development team is continuing to work on the whole long-read capabilities of our systems.","Dan Arias \u2013 UBS","So if one were a betting man, you would say that maybe Marco Allen was an opportunity to perhaps here about that?","Jay Flatley","Well, we've already talked about it. I don't think we necessarily would launch it there, unless we are ready to ship it. I think probably the next time you'll hear from us is when we actually start shipping it.","Dan Arias \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Jay Flatley","","There's not much more news to tell you in advance of that.","Operator","","Okay. Thank you. The next question we have then comes from the line Amanda Murphy of William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company","","Hi, thank you. I had another question on the X10. It seems like some of the government-funded centers \u2013 and I know you've sold a few here to those guys already \u2013 but it seems like you may be in a bit of a bind in that many of them are capacity constrained, but sort of have maybe not capital around to buy an X10 and then also fund it from a reagent perspective.","I'm curious \u2013 I know it's a bit early, but have you had any conversations with those types of customers, or do you have any thoughts on how they might be a bit more creative with funding to be able to buy an X10? It also seems like many of them don't necessarily want to outsource, they want to own the data. I'm curious if you have any thoughts on that?","Jay Flatley","","Yes. We're having conversations with all of them. I think to my earlier comment there's no lack of interest in getting access to an X10, in fact to the contrary. Some of them may not have enough money to do it right now, and we'll look to figure out ways to raise that money. I think clearly the NIH is excited by what we did here, and so they may decide to do some allocations."," This is purely speculative on my part. This isn't a prediction. But they could appeal to the NIH for some incremental funds to be in the game at this level with the $1,000 genome. Clearly there is potential for philanthropic ways of raising money to do programs such as this. Each of them in their own way are going to try to become creative enough to try to get access to this technology, and we'll just have to see how many of them are successful.","Amanda Murphy","","Okay. In terms of the legacy HiSeq install base, do you have any perspective at this point on what percentage of those might upgrade \u2013 you know, the ones that can't access the terra-based reagent kit?","Jay Flatley","","How many would upgrade to 2500?","Amanda Murphy","Yes. Just thinking about the ones that shipped a year ago or so that can't necessarily use the terra-based, and maybe have to buy a new platform. I'm curious \u2013 I don't know if thinking about it as a percentage of install base is the right way to do it?","Jay Flatley","","Yes. It's really hard to tell, Amanda, because you'll have some of those customers who will continue to use that, and they do some outsourcing to somebody who has an X10. There's some that may say I want to buy a couple of NextSeqs to complement my system. There could be some who decide to upgrade to get the 1T pricing and access. Over a period of years, maybe 20% to 40%. Some number in that range, probably.","Amanda Murphy","Got it. Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Jay Flatley","","Sure.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I know it's a little early with the new two-die technology to think about long-term implications for the margins, but it does seem like that should help you guys generate even better margins on the consumables. Just trying to think about how to pace that through the numbers. Obviously it's still pretty new, but over time I would assume this will be chemistry that works across all of the platforms that you offer. Any kind of paced out long-term view you can offer on the margin impact would be great?","Jay Flatley","","Clearly, one of the reasons we did it is because it reduces the cost profile. Clearly, it does that on the instrument, because we now only need two optical channels, so that was a key driver. It does, to some extent, raise the reagent volumes, which were critical in a platform like this, to get the full HiSeq capability into a single cartridge with lower reagent volumes.","To the extent that you speculate about it going across the other systems, it would require brand-new optics. This isn't something that in its current form we just plug directly into a HiSeq. It would need to be a new generation of those systems to take advantage of the two-channel chemistry.","The last thing I would say is that we ought to make sure that we are clear that this is two-channel not two-die. We actually do use four dies here, it's just that they're detected in two channels. There's \u2013 it's slightly different than you what might think of as two-die chemistry. It's four dies in two channels.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That's helpful. One more on technology. With the NeoPrep, just trying to get a little bit of a sense of what some of the hurdles are to meeting your launch target this summer? I think I was probably a little surprised by how quickly you guys were able to talk about that product, given how recent the ALL acquisition was. Any key milestones you guys are working on to reach your target would be great? Thank you.","Jay Flatley","","Yes. One of the most important things we need to do is to move over all the applications onto the platform, so the instrument is obviously working and working well in our hands and in our development labs, or else we would not have spoken about it. But what we need to do now is put all of the robustness into the applications and make sure that the cartridges are optimized for these applications and do extensive testing.","Obviously, we're going through all of the iterations that we typically do in product design, from pilots into \u2013 and then starting to ramp production in the second quarter. We're going through a pretty routine phase of our development. Most of the \u2013 I'd say all of the uncertainty is gone in the instrument itself, and now it's really about porting applications over.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Please proceed.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink Partners","","Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on your discussion of trade-ins earlier. Are you offering any trade-in deals on legacy Illumina boxes, especially now that it appears you are discontinuing older HiSeq models?","Jay Flatley","","We don't have any specific programs to trade those in, but if somebody came to us and said I've got two really old legacy instruments. Can I get a little bigger discount? We might give them a little bigger discount. That's generally how we treat those customers. We want to treat them well, because they've been good customers for us, but we don't have any specific trade-in programs.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink Partners","Got it. My follow-up question \u2013 Jay, could you speak to \u2013 it sounds like your \u2013 you have a lot of incoming interest on the X10. Could you speak to that interest by customer type? The reason I'm asking is because I want to assess if big pharma or biotech could be a meaningful customer type since you announced the announced the Amgen\/Decode order.","Jay Flatley","Yes. It's coming from multiple segments of the market, so clearly we've had some academic labs. We have interest in sort of what we call the nations-type programs, where a country might buy it, or some representative of a country might buy it, to begin to sequence some subset of the population. We clearly have sparked some interest in the pharma and biotech industry. Now to the extent they actually decide to go do this is an open question. We haven't talked about any of those that have crossed the finish line. We're not sure.","But I think at $1,000 this has catalyzed the imagination of many of our customer types. Our hope is that we have sort of a second Renaissance in genomic discovery begin to happen on the back of the X10. I think it really has that potential broadly. Stay tuned, and we're obviously working hard to try to satisfy the demand that's coming in, but it's a broad set of customers that have interest.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink Partners","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citigroup. Please proceed.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 CitigroupHi. Jay, I was hoping you could give us a little more color on the performance of Verinata in the quarter. Also, when you think about 2014, maybe a little bit of color on the cadence of the consumer array component of the business, given that they're \u2013 one of your customers is in limbo right now.","Jay Flatley","","Yes. The Verinata business was good in the quarter. We don't report the exact numbers, because obviously we supply to everyone in this industry. In total we think that continues to be a growing market and a great opportunity.","The next big milestones to think about here will certainly be number one, the extent to which this begins to move into average risk categories after data becomes published, and we expect to begin to see that before the middle of next year. I think that will significantly broaden out the market for all of our customers.","I think obviously the second thing we're working on very hard is the IBD approval on the 2500. Hopefully \u2013 we're hoping to have a milestone this year to actually have that submitted into the FDA. I'm sorry, the second part of your question was about?","Rebecca Chambers","","Consumer cadence.","Jay Flatley","","Cadence of consumer, yes. I think the company you referenced is sort of evaluating their options right now. I guess you would have to talk to them about what they expect to be doing over the next couple of quarters.","We think that there are many other consumer opportunities that are somewhat different than the business model that particular company has. We are pretty optimistic that there's going to be a very large number of consumer samples happen in 2014. Matt, who runs our new Nest team, the new and emerging market business unit, is pretty confident that we will do more consumer samples in 2014 than we've ever done in total before. That's going to take us closing some \u2013 a couple big deals to make that happen, but we're pretty confident about those.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup","Jay, as a follow-up on NextSeq, is there anything about installation and installation times that we should be aware of as these start to go out into the field and start to generate data and consumable revenue?","Jay Flatley","","By that do you mean how fast can we get service people there to install them or how easy are they to install?","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup","Both.","Jay Flatley","","Both. Well, this instrument was designed to be much easier to install to start with, and so our hope is that compared to either a MiSeq or a HiSeq, that these will go in much more quickly. It does require one of our people to be on site at least for now to do the installation.","The reason we think it's going to be a whole lot better is because the optics are essentially solid-state in the system in comparison to the other products. Very often on the other products after the rough handling these get in the belly of airplanes and being dropped off the back of trucks, we have to readjust the optics. With NextSeq, that should not be the case. It will be faster, and therefore we think our service team will be more efficient in getting larger numbers of these installed quickly.","We've obviously planned and forecasted out that demand into our services organization, and one of the investments that we've been making that you see appearing in the SG&A line is to build out our service organization so that we're ready to handle the flood of new products that we're putting into the market.","Marc Stapley","","One of the assumptions that we make whenever we launch a new product is the initial installation is always going to be a little higher and it will run down over time. The same really applies to the reliability and the warranty part of it. That's why, for example, you saw in this quarter a stronger gross margin as we had some better warranty experience in our existing instruments, and we expect somewhat of a similar trend will be probably less marked on NextSeq for the reasons that Jay mentioned about how it was designed from the ground up.","Amit Bhalla \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. The next we have comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Bill Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First question for Jay. ","Jay Flatley","Hey, Bill.","Bill Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, hi. First question recognizing that paying about $10 million for an X10 then not using it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Also considering the amount of demand that you are seeing, as well as the supply constraints, can you just talk a little bit about how you are prioritizing the placements? For example, are you putting any minimum reagent commitments into the contracts, or capital commitments, that sort of thing?","Jay Flatley","No. We're not doing that. We are of course evaluating two very important characteristics of any customer that wants one of these. One is do they have the sample collection, which does directly relate to their ability to buy and consume the reagents; and do they have the informatics capability to both handle, store, and analyze the data. Those are two threshold considerations that we look at as customers come forward.","We also want to be sure that these customers generally know how to run a sequencing center, because we're not really at the point where this is an absolute turnkey installation. I think after some period of time we may get to that where we attach some professional services to this and we can actually train people from scratch if they don't have anything, if they're starting from zero. But that's not where we want to install the initial system. So that's a third criteria that we use. After that, it's largely first-come, first-serve. Whoever gets their purchase orders in first would get into the queue first.","Bill Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, got it. Marc, how should we think about the timing of revenue recognition here? I'm guessing that since it's a new product you are going to want to probably have a little tighter or more stringent revenue rec then you would if say you're shipping the tenth HiSeq to another \u2013 to an existing customer?","Marc Stapley","","Not really in terms of \u2013 other than us being able to feel very confident that that instrument performs relative to the specs that we put out there, which we obviously are. We should be able to recognize revenue on installation, without any real difference in the way we do it today on any HiSeq that we sell. You've got to remember it's an evolution of a product, versus a completely new product. I'd say the same applies to the NextSeq, as well. We should have sufficient installations of that to be able to recognize revenue at a normal rate.","Bill Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.","Marc Stapley","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of John Groberg of Macquarie. Please proceed.","John Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","","Hey. Thanks a million for taking the question. Jay, I think someone asked this at the Investor Day, but I have just been thinking more about it, and I just wanted to maybe have you flesh it out a little more. But if I think about where you sit from a technology perspective, at the high end, in terms of the existing throughput, there's not a lot of competition for you at the moment.","Thinking about all the directions that you could've gone in terms of maybe higher quality long reads, that there is an unmet need for \u2013 just your thought about why now in introducing the X10 capability. I'm curious strategically how that thought process went about?","Jay Flatley","","Yes, a couple things. One is that we've had the technological capability to deliver this largely in our back pocket, so it was a question of how we applied R&D resources that could have been applied in many different ways, as you mentioned there. I think the reason we selected this path is because as I said in my remarks, we think the demand for whole human genome sequencing is there, and there's a real thirst to do this at a massive scale. There's just been a historic problem with the price point.","One of the things we think is most important in the long run to opening up clinical sequencing and therefore the real world of personalized medicine is improving the clinical UTI utility of the genome. Today, after all the work we and everybody in the industry's been doing over the last 15 years, we've still only scratched the surface about understanding what the genome really means. All of the analysis now that are done by the brilliant scientists in our field say that the way you break through that barrier is by sequencing very large sample sets, and by that, the numbers pencil out to be hundreds of thousands of samples.","The current technology, meaning the 2500, was not going to get there, because people couldn't get enough money to sequence enough samples to break through that utility barrier, and HiSeq X does it. I think what you're seeing in terms of the market reaction is a sense that there really is an opportunity now to redo the discovery programs that were done or attempted to be done 10 or 15 years ago, but now with a set of tools it's up to the task. That's really what it's all about.","John Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Maybe just as a quick follow-up, forgetting about cannibalization of instrumentation, but if I just think about samples. What's your expectation that people do more whole human genomes as you're talking about? What does that replace, or do you not think it replaces anything that they are currently doing?","Jay Flatley","","We think it's largely incremental, John. As I mentioned earlier, today our customers only sequence 10% to 15% of their samples at the whole human genome level. Some of that will move on to X10s. We think the fraction of samples done at whole genomes as a percentage of the total samples will now go off dramatically.","I think it begins to push people towards whole genome sequencing, which is where we think the market needs to go to get the full scientific benefit of what this technology can provide, and to have visibility into the entire genome without a hypothesis up front. I think those are the driving forces that we're seeing, and there's plenty of samples out there. There's no lack of samples at the unit numbers we are talking about here.","John Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question we have comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","Zarak Khurshid \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. ","Jay, as we try to understand the faster growing parts of your business, I was wondering if you could give us a flavor for how fast the sales to consumer is focused on clinical cancer applications is growing, versus maybe the broader business, and if you could give us a sense for how that has tracked kind of versus last year, that would be great?","Jay Flatley","","By that do you mean \u2013 when you say cancer to consumers, are you talking about the foundation medicine type market, that market, or\u2026","Zarak Khurshid \u2013 Wedbush Securities","No, more sales across all customers. Yes, focused on anything pertaining to cancer in the clinic.","Jay Flatley","","Yes. Well, the growth rates are almost meaningless at this point because we're starting off such low numbers over the last couple of years, so growth rates aren't really the way to think about it. If you try to analyze the numbers of samples being done, it's still pretty small in terms of what we think will be done over the next few years.","Foundation medicine is getting great traction. I think as we get more standardization, better reimbursement, and more clinical actionable panels into the market, that the sample numbers will go up dramatically. I think these discovery programs are going to help enormously in terms of figuring out what the right companion diagnostic looks like, and what any remaining characteristics of the genome are that might apply to oncology. All those factors make us really optimistic about the rate of adoption.","I was at the Precise [ph] Medicine Conference yesterday, and it's hugely focused on the rapid up-spring in oncology testing. Stanford, they're starting to test everybody that comes in with a panel product, and this is starting to happen in all the major cancer centers. I think we're only a few years away from the point where everyone who has cancer gets it tested genomically one way or another, with one kind of panel, or exome, or genome.","Zarak Khurshid \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Understood, that's great. As a follow-up, as we think about the translational research side of the business, obviously it's been a nice performer. Is there a way that you can help us get our arms around that market as a whole in terms of the size and potential and importance of that sub-sector within the broader research business?","Jay Flatley","","It's really hard for us to break it apart. One of the reasons we changed our business unit structure was recognizing the fact that there's this sort of blending between research translational and clinical work. We don't have a good way to estimate that portion, because many labs do all three things in the same place. It's pretty difficult for us to come up with a number.","Zarak Khurshid \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay, thanks.","Operator","","Thank you.

For those of you unable to attend this conference, we encourage you to listen to the webcast presentation, which will be available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jay.","Jay T. Flatley","Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. To begin today, I will provide an update on the state of our business and markets before turning to our commercial progress. Marc will then review our fourth quarter financial results and our guidance for fiscal 2013.","Despite uncertainty around sequestration and the general macro environment, our business has continued to accelerate. Q4 shipments were strong across all geographies, and revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $309 million. Shipments to the Americas grew 20% year-over-year, and European shipments were up 26% over the same period. Shipments to Asia continue to be strong with year-over-year growth of 12%, including 30% growth in Greater China.","While the NIH funding environment remains uncertain in light of a potential sequestration, our customers continue to display stable ordering patterns. We believe this is due in part to a larger percentage of NIH funds being granted to sequencing-based research. Additionally, the European and Asian funding environments remain stable, and Asia may even improve slightly in light of Japan's recent stimulus announcement.","Despite these positive trends, we remain focused on diversifying our customer base. In fiscal 2012, approximately 30% of revenue came from nonacademic and nongovernment segments, and our goal is to increase this to approximately 50% of revenue over the next 5 years. We believe this is possible as we accelerate the penetration of our technology into applied markets including the clinical, translational, consumer, forensic and agricultural segments.","I'd like to now turn to the specifics of the Q4 results. Total microarray revenue increased 4% year-over-year due to the impact of BlueGnome, while organic microarray revenue declined slightly. Order volume grew sequentially as a result of demand for the Infinium Omni arrays and significant interest in the recently launched Infinium HumanCore arrays. In the first 2.5 months since launch, we received orders for 325,000 samples of the HumanCore arrays, which we expect to begin shipping this quarter.","As an illustration of the high activity level that remains in the array market, in Q4, we shipped over 1 million samples worth of arrays across all of our array-based product lines, including Infinium, GoldenGate and VeraCode.","Turning now to our sequencing business. Total sequencing revenue grew 35% over the fourth quarter of 2011, driven by strong demand for consumables. In fact in the fourth quarter, sequencing consumables grew 56% year-over-year due to higher utilization per instrument, as well as growth in both the HiSeq and MiSeq install base.","Our Sample Prep business continue to gain share in the quarter and contributed significantly to sequencing consumables growth. Nextera and Nextera XT Sample Prep kits had a particularly strong quarter, and the TruSeq demand was strong from translational and clinical customers. In addition, we are further expanding our portfolio with a launch of innovative Sample Prep solutions that streamline workflows and decrease turnaround times. In the first quarter, we expect to launch the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome Kit, which will enable the fastest exome enrichment workflow for use on both the HiSeq and the MiSeq platforms. These kits will make the workflow 70% faster than the current solution.","We also plan to release TruSeq Targeted RNA kits this quarter, targeting the mid-plex real-time PCR market, which we estimate to be a $300 million market today.","Finally, I'm pleased to announce that we begun shipping our TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Kit, which provides industry-leading genome coverage, high accuracy in identifying variants and the ability to sequence challenging regions of the genome.","We also continued to deliver dramatic enhancements to our SBS chemistry. Our latest technology innovations demonstrate the scalability of SBS by enhancing cluster density and read lengths. Our novel ordered array technology overcomes typical statistical limits to significantly increase cluster density and the number of reads per flow cell. This breakthrough development will increase sequencing output, enhance counting applications and reduce turnaround time through more efficient image processing.","We expect to begin field testing this technology in Q3 and have it incorporated in our first kits around year end. We also recently announced the acquisition of Moleculo, which gives us access to a proprietary technology for assembling phased reads of more than 10 Kb at an extremely low error rate of Q50 or better. Through Sample Prep and bioinformatics, researchers can create a completely phased genome in 4 days with only 30G of incremental sequencing. This will directly benefit approximately 10% of the NGS applications today, as well as a portion of the capillary market. We plan to launch this in our services business during the second quarter, with kits available toward the end of the year.","We will further expand the capability of the HiSeq platform in the second half of this year with the launch of new kits to sequence up to 300G in approximately 60 hours. This expanded capability will come solely from enhancements to reagents and software.","Sequencing instrument revenue increased 6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, with MiSeq instrument sales demonstrating significant growth year-over-year. Additionally, ASPs remain strong despite the ongoing success of our trade-in program. Interest in the MiSeq platform also widened since we laid out the updated product roadmap at ASHG, including a path to 15G of output. Based on field commentary, our competitive position has strengthened, and we're optimistic that strong ordering patterns will persist.","During the fourth quarter, we received more than 300 MiSeq orders, which exceeded our manufacturing capacity. This strong order trend, along with MiSeq winning head -- 80% to 90% of the head-to-head competitions, provides evidence that we have more than 50% market share this quarter.","Customers are choosing MiSeq as it consistently delivers higher output and better data quality along with the easiest workflow. We believe this end-to-end workflow, including back-end informatics, streamlined data analysis and data sharing features via BaseSpace, offer the most comprehensive solution for desktop sequencing customers.","The successful launch of the HiSeq 2500 in October illustrates the tremendous value customers find in the HiSeq platform. We now expect to upgrade around 35% of the existing HiSeq installed base. It will take us most of 2013 to complete this upgrade program as less than 10% of the installed base was upgraded during the fourth quarter. The HiSeq platform is now also enabled to stream data to BaseSpace. The breadth of analysis and functionality being delivered by BaseSpace apps is growing every month, and we expect a full e-commerce rollout in the second quarter.","Our FastTrack Services business shipped more than 2,500 genomes in the fourth quarter or close to 3x the number shipped in Q4 of last year. Demand grew consistently through 2012, and in total, the Illumina Genome Network received orders for approximately 13,000 genomes. Today, interest in sequencing services remains high, including preliminary talks of large hospitals and governments that hope to sequence significant numbers of individuals.","To fill the demand for sequencing services, we've added significant new capacity to our San Diego facility and will open a new lab later this quarter in our Hayward location. This facility, along with improvements to our existing infrastructure, will provide the capacity to sequence approximately 30,000 genomes this year.","Moving on to our clinical business. We recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire Verinata Health, a leading provider of non-invasive prenatal test or NIPT, for the early identification of fetal chromosomal abnormalities. This acquisition will build on our earlier acquisition of BlueGnome, adding another building block to our portfolio and moving us toward our goal of leading the genetic revolution in reproductive health.","These acquisitions, combined with our internal carrier screening and cytogenetics programs, provide us with a solid foundation to accomplish this goal. With this acquisition, Illumina is uniquely positioned to enable the growth of the NIPT market. We believe Verinata possesses foundational IP and has the most compressive non-invasive prenatal test. Our strategy will be to leverage these strengths by licensing Verinata's intellectual property, and once we compile the necessary data, submitting the test for regulatory approvals. We believe an IVD test will significantly expand the global market and enable all test providers to be successful in this field.","Verinata has signed an exclusive U.S. distribution agreement with PerkinElmer to drive adoption of the verifi prenatal test. We're excited about this announcement and look forward to participating in this partnership once our acquisition of Verinata has closed.","I'm pleased to report that we also submitted our first 2 sequencing products to the FDA for 510(k) clearance in the fourth quarter: the MiSeqDx system and the cystic fibrosis full gene sequencing assay. We believe the CF assay is differentiated from current test offerings as it will sequence the entire CF gene while also identifying a group of specific CF areas.","We're pleased with our execution in 2012 and our outlook for revenue growth in 2013 and beyond. To ensure this momentum translates into strong long term revenue growth, we will continue to make incremental investments in our core business in addition to investing in Verinata and BlueGnome.","We have focused 2013 organic investments in 3 key areas. First, while the competitive dynamics surrounding our sequencing platforms are strong, today we're not able to match the geographic reach of our competitors. To improve this position, we plan to add more than 50 additional sales reps over the course of the year. This investment will add to growth in the near term and create significant leverage in the years beyond.","We also plan to invest incrementally more in research and development this year due to the richness of our portfolio opportunities. Our goal is to remain in the leading edge of technology by introducing even a greater number of new products, investigating new chemistries including nanopore and working to provide solutions to customer bioinformatic challenges.","Lastly, we're investing in the necessary infrastructure enhancements to support a $2 billion company. We recently began 2 new projects that are projected to cost approximately $10 million in 2013. The first multiyear project, being led by Marc Stapley, is focused on improving our global business processes via enhancements to our ERP system, as well as the related systems and processes necessary to support our growth projections. Christian Henry is leading a second project, which is focused specifically on manufacturing, planning and inventory management. Success of these programs will improve our order fulfillment performance and ultimately our gross margins as we more efficiently meet customer requirements.","Part of this infrastructure build will be particularly focused on diagnostic and clinical customers. While nascent today, the clinical adoption of NGS is set to revolutionize health care. To this point, a number of organizations have recently published guidelines on the use of NGS in the clinic, including the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the Association for Molecular Pathology and the CDC. These groups have cited the increased rate of clinical adoption of NGS as the catalyst for guidelines in an effort to ensure patients have access to high-quality data and interpretation. We believe that by making these strategic investments, we will accelerate the adoption of sequencing technologies more broadly into all of our end markets and position ourselves for strong long term revenue growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc who will provide a detailed overview of the fourth quarter results.","Marc Stapley","Thanks, Jay. During my section of today's call, I will review our fourth quarter financial results before providing commentary on our guidance for 2013. With respect to Q4, as Jay described, our positive momentum continued, and led not only to the fifth quarter of sequential revenue and EPS growth, but also our strongest quarter ever.","Impressive MiSeq instrument sales, as well as demand for sequencing consumables of whole-genome services, generated record revenue of $309 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Our BlueGnome acquisition contributed revenue of approximately $7 million in the quarter, which is higher than our original estimate due to the early success of the ongoing integration.","Revenue for 2012 was $1.15 billion, which represents an increase of 9% over 2011, reflecting primarily consumables growth year-over-year. Instrument revenue for the fourth quarter was $80 million, which is flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. HiSeq shipments were down slightly year-over-year, as was the demand for microarray instruments, but this was offset by strong demand for our MiSeq benchtop instrument.","Consumable revenue in the quarter was $196 million, an increase of 36% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, primarily due to higher demand of sequencing consumables and the impact of BlueGnome. Consumable revenue represented 63% of total revenue, up from 57% in Q4 last year and up slightly sequentially.","As we build out the sequencing installed base, consumable sales continue to climb, and this contributes to the improved mix year-over-year. For the full year, the average consumable pull-through was approximately $320,000 for HiSeq and approximately $50,000 for MiSeq. Due to the fact that seasonality and the timing of budgeting cycles can cause significant quarterly fluctuations in the pull-through rate, going forward on a quarterly basis, we plan to give qualitative commentary comparing against our projected annualized pull-through levels. These projected ranges are $300,000 to $350,000 for HiSeq and $45,000 to $50,000 for MiSeq.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services, as well as instrument maintenance contracts, was $30 million for the quarter, a 54% increase year-over-year. This was driven largely by the significant number of genomes processed in the quarter, as well as the ongoing growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with the growing instrument installed base.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense, headquarter relocation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 68.5%. This compares to 70.5% in the third quarter of 2012. The sequential decline in gross margin was due to nonrecurring power replacement costs associated with our extended warranty services, inventory reserves, manufacturing variances and a small impact from BlueGnome margin dilution. Admittedly, we were disappointed with this result but are confident that the programs that we already have in place, that Christian and I are sponsoring, will help to ensure that we see a gradual improvement in gross margin going forward. These programs include the inventory planning and management system, as well as the global business process program that Jay mentioned earlier, in addition to discrete programs focusing on reductions in cost of goods sold.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $48 million or 15.4% of revenue, compared to 15.9% in the third quarter and up slightly over the 15% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase is primarily due to headcount additions, as well as the impact of BlueGnome.","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $62 million or 19.9% of revenue in the quarter. This is compared to the 19.5% of revenue in the third quarter and a decline from the 20.1% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2011. Legal fees associated with the Complete Genomics bid, as well as the Verinata and Moleculo acquisitions contributed to the slight increase over Q3.","Adjusted operating margins were 33.1% compared to 35.1% in the third quarter due to lower gross margins as well as higher SG&A expense. On a year-over-year basis, operating margins contracted somewhat due to lower gross margins as well as higher research and development expense.","In the fourth quarter, we recognized approximately $1.6 million of adjusted other income, which included interest income recognized on a recovered loan that was previously impaired.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 28.9% compared to 35.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. The Q4 tax rate benefited from the transition of manufacturing to Singapore exceeding our full year internal expectation, but did not benefit from the 2012 R&D tax credit, which was enacted in January and will therefore be recognized in the current quarter.","Non-GAAP net income was $57 million for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS was $0.42. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $44 million and $0.35, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2011. These results were slightly better than we projected at the time of the JPMorgan conference, with the lower-than-anticipated gross margin being more than offset by the tax rate coming in below our forecast. Those items being updated subsequent to the conference as part of our normal close process.","We recorded GAAP net income of $72 million or $0.53 per diluted share in the fourth quarter compared to $11.7 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the prior year period. Current period results include the sale of our minority investment in deCODE Genetics to Amgen, which resulted in a pretax gain of $48.6 million. Additionally, we incurred $4 million of ongoing expenses related to Roche's unsolicited tender offer, as well as a $3 million charge associated with the relocation of our headquarters. This charge is primarily due to a delay in the anticipated sublease of our prior headquarters.","During the quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $79 million. Capital expenditures were approximately $17 million, resulting in $62 million of free cash flow. DSO decreased to 63 days compared to 69 days last quarter, and we ended the quarter with $1.35 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the quarter, approximately 496,000 shares were repurchased for $25 million under our previously announced repurchase program, leaving slightly more than $165 million of authorization remaining.","Before looking ahead to 2013, I'd like to clarify that all guidance estimates include the impact of the Verinata transaction, which we do expect to close shortly after the satisfaction of regulatory approvals. For fiscal 2013, we are projecting total company revenue growth of approximately 15% and full year non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 to $1.62. Included in these projections are the following assumptions: Verinata dilution of up to $0.20; 70% gross margin; the impact of the investments Jay mentioned earlier; stock compensation expense of $115 million; assuming the current stock price, full year weighted average non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of 134 million; and a full year pro forma tax rate of 31%, which includes the benefit of Singapore manufacturing, the 2013 U.S. R&D tax credit, and, in Q1, a catch-up benefit from the 2012 R&D tax credit.","To conclude, we have made significant progress this quarter with our market-leading instruments, and customer interest continues to be strong. Our installed base in both the high throughput and in desktop markets has continued to grow, and our new product introductions have been well received. In addition, we have furthered our diagnostic strategy with an acquisition in one of the fastest growing clinical segments. We believe that our planned investments are critical to ensure that we efficiently deliver the most innovative and highest-quality solutions to both our existing and new customers, enabling strong revenue growth in 2013 and beyond.","Thank you for your time, and we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe just first question on the gross margin guidance. Can you maybe talk about some of the gives and takes to get to that 70%? Obviously, you talked about some of the investments that are being made on the IT front. But can you just talk about where you're going to get some of the leverage?","Marc Stapley","Yes, Tycho. So some of the leverage is going to come from -- we mentioned we had some nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter, so obviously, we're doing a lot to address that as well so that will help us in the first quarter. The consumable mix will continue to help us. From the headwind standpoint, as I've always said, as our services business grows as well, that's dilutive to margin. And then the Verinata acquisition itself would be somewhat dilutive in the quarter when that closes. And then the other is pricing. We think we have leverage there including consumable pricing. Remember the pricing increase that we put in place during 2012. Some of that was deferred based on standing orders that were placed, and the effect of that will come through in the first quarter in addition to in the second quarter, the new pricing increase -- relatively modest pricing increase that we've talked about previously.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on Verinata. You talked about, obviously, when you announced at the uncertain IP landscape. Can you just maybe talk to timelines to which we think you could get some resolution there? And then are you still looking at acquiring additional content to help kind of build that out as you partner with Perkin?","Jay T. Flatley","Intellectual property, as you know, Tycho, is always an area of uncertainty in terms of timing. Our goal, certainly, is to enter into discussions with all the players and all the owners of various intellectual property in the field and see whether there's the potential to sort this out in a way that's rational for everyone. We're not sure that's the case, but we're hopeful that it is. I suspect we'll have a first shot at that sometime in the next quarter. If we're not able to do that, then these various litigations will proceed along the traditional legal tracks which often take multiple years. With respect to content, I'm not sure what your question was directed toward exactly.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You had talked about maybe adding on Turner syndrome, Triple X, other content that could be kind of bundled with this.","Jay T. Flatley","I see, yes. So the existing Verinata test includes the 3 trisomies, the 18 -- 21, 18 and 13, and it also includes today the typical sex chromosome abnormalities. And so that's where the test will stay for some time. But you did see a publication shortly after we announced the transaction, I believe it was Thursday of the week of JPMorgan, a publication by scientists at Verinata talking about the ability to use this test to detect some chromosomal abnormalities. And so that's something to focus on in the future, but nothing we're prepared to comment on specifically as to timelines.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You guys have been, obviously, pretty active with M&A over the past few months, so I guess just a few related questions. First, would you be willing to break out how much of the growth that you expect in 2013 is organic versus inorganic revenue? And how much of that is Verinata? I guess the second question would be, mathematically, it seems like you're layering on at least $40 million to $50 million in operating expense onto the P&L via the Verinata transaction. Is that all Verinata-specific or would you expect some benefit from that spend as you think about, really, broader clinical initiatives that you are targeting over the next few years? And then finally, any update on how discussions are progressing with some of Verinata's competitors that are existing Illumina customers?","Jay T. Flatley","Okay, let me give a shot at those things. So to the first part of the question, we're not going to decompose the revenue any further than we've done during the script, Doug, so we're not going to give a lot of further insights into that. I think you can, based on some of the guidance we gave about dilution, back into some of the Verinata numbers if you work at that. With respect to the incremental expenses in Verinata, there is going to be some carryover into other parts of the business. Certainly, one of the things we're going to be doing quite actively this year and next is investing heavily in the clinical trial work necessary to get an IVD product into the market. So that's over and above the traditional headcount expenses that you would inherit, and that's all budgeted into the numbers that we've included for the dilution. There are some areas where we'll be able to work with them in clin reg and things like that, where it may give us the opportunity to not spend as much as we might have in San Diego. And clearly, the program will be integrated very tightly with what we're doing at BlueGnome, because particularly as we get into subchromosomal analysis, there's a very clear intersection with what we're doing with PGD and with cytogenetics. So those programs will become more integrated as we move forward. With respect to discussions with the other players, we've obviously met with them, and over the next, I'd say, a month or 2, we'll be in significant discussions with them about the various interest that they each have in this field and working forward to address any concerns they might have about their supply agreements, et cetera.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one real quick one. You again acknowledged, really, the commercial reach disadvantage that you say you have in benchtop sequencing, and that's part of the incremental spend that you guys outlined in your prepared remarks today. But do you believe the fact that you received 300 orders for MiSeq in Q4, is it all a sign that this disadvantage is dissipating?","Jay T. Flatley","We do think we've made significant progress already, both in getting word-of-mouth from the first users of MiSeq who love the instrument are talking to others in the market and the rate of publications that's ramping up, so there's a bit of a viral effect that's beginning to take hold with respect to MiSeq. We still remain challenged in some of the more distant geographies. And by that, I mean, places where you wouldn't normally have a direct sales organization. And so we do plan to beef that up both through addition of some improved distributor networks, but also just adding in people. And those would go into typical -- or customer sites that we wouldn't normally call on. So I think there's more to be had here and the 50 incremental sales reps that we plan to add, we think will be enough to get us to the next level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you just give us a general feel for how many MiSeqs you placed in 2012? And I'm just trying to get a sense for where so we are in the rollout and the market opportunity. It's like, what do you think is the potential for the penetration of that? And then I also want to sort of flip that over to HiSeq, and I'm just trying to get what's sort of embedded in 2013 for your instrumentation expectation?","Jay T. Flatley","I'm sorry, Derik, I missed the last part of the question.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm just trying to get a sense, when we look at the 2013 guidance, what should we be thinking about instrument growth versus consumables growth?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. Well, the last data point that we gave on MiSeq was when we passed through the 1,000-unit number. And so that's the latest update we've given on the installed base, and you can assume that we're significantly above that now. We did get 300 orders, as we mentioned, in the fourth quarter. We didn't ship that many because we also stated that, that 300-unit number exceeded our production capacity during the quarter and, obviously, therefore exceeded our forecast in terms of what we expected. So the momentum around HiSeq is really quite good. And I think you can use that 300 as a benchmark to make your extrapolation on what you think that placement rate might look like through the course of this year. So far, we're continuing to see growth in MiSeqs. I don't think I would say that every quarter we're going to continue to grow the order rate. At some point, that's going to flatten out some. And HiSeqs, I think you can, roughly, think about that as being in the ballpark of flattish on a units basis, although varying a little bit quarter-to-quarter.","Christian O. Henry","I think the one thing about HiSeq, though, Derik, is that the 2500 really gives us an opportunity as an upsell because it's typically at a higher ASP than a 2000. And so even though the -- and many customers are buying -- are opting for the 2500 over the 2000. So on a revenue basis, that really helps us.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, in fact, we saw it in the fourth quarter, a significant uptick in ASP because of the mix toward the 2500.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's really helpful. So Doug sort of asked the one question on the competition floor Verinata. I'm going to ask the competition on the services side of the business. With BGI now going to be acquiring Complete Genomics, how do you look at that relationship going forward? And have you had any indication from customers about what they're thinking about that?","Jay T. Flatley","I think it's a little early to tell because they don't own them yet, so I don't think what we've seen in the marketplace is reflective of any different strategy or new strategy on the part of Complete Genomics. Once the transaction's complete, we'll obviously be watching for that. Our goal is to continue to make BGI a very successful customer and have a successful relationship with them. Once they complete the transaction, we will be having a series of meetings with them to sort of understand where they want their supply agreement to go with us, and that agreement is up for renewal in the April timeframe. So it's quite timely, actually, so we will be sitting down with them shortly to go through all that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So I had a question on the ordered arrays you talked about at JPMorgan. You talked about the arrays providing meaningful benefits on the HiSeq. So I'm curious what exactly that means in terms of performance for customers? And ultimately, could that translate to a bigger benefit on the MiSeq than, perhaps, initially?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we haven't given out the exact specs yet, Amanda. And the reason we haven't is because we haven't decided exactly how we're going to formulate the kits yet. So it's not really that we don't have the answer, it's really a marketing question now about how we actually design the particular flow cells that we'll put in these kits. On all of the sequencing products, you'll have a direct linear relationship between the cluster density that we have traditionally extrapolated now to the number of ordered features. So whatever that increase is, you'll increase that number of tags. And therefore, for counting application such as expression, you'll have that direct relationship. If there's 1.5x as many tags, you'll have 1.5x as many features, you'll have 1.5x as many tags for expression. With respect to the amount of sequencing output, it's a little more difficult because it will relate to a couple of different factors. One is to the optical resolution of the particular instrument, which may help dictate the exact pitch or the distance between the ordered features. And that may wind up being different on the different flow cells for the different products. And it also is also conflated with the read lengths. So if we're changing read lengths on these instruments as well, we have to be a little bit cautious about quoting numbers because some parts of the overall increase in output will come as a result of read lengths versus density increase on the flow cell. So that's a long-winded answer to basically say you're going to have to wait a little while longer until we actually determine the specific kit configurations that we're going to launch, what the impact is.","Marc Stapley","But I do think the one thing that's really interesting to think about is the quality of the reads today at 150, 250 base pairs is really high. And with the ordered arrays, you may make trade-offs to decide, \"Hey, I want to stay at 150 or 250 base pairs and get an improvement in density,\" or you may want to go out, we may decide to optimize on the longer read length with a wider pitch, so to speak, to keep the performance of the -- whatever that particular flow cell product in a specific range. So it gives us a lot more flexibility.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then the other thing I was going to ask is, I guess, at a high level on -- obviously, you're not going to talk too much about your pipeline. But one of the takeaways I had, given your recent announcement, is that there's clearly a lot more room on the -- just the SBS chemistry. You're -- you've mentioned some of the read length improvements that you can make, et cetera. So I'm just curious how to think about that in terms of just the capacity of the industry, where that's at currently and sort of the propensity for customers to adopt technology going forward? Obviously, you're not saying you're going to have any platforms or anything like that, but just thinking about how much more room you have on the SBS chemistry versus sort of new products you may or may not be introducing in the long term?","Jay T. Flatley","Our capacity industry, I presume you meant the market's ability to absorb new technology or greater output?","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Exactly, yes.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, yes. Well, we think, and we thought this for a long time, but that the actual demand for sequencing in any near-term horizon really is an insatiable demand. I think if you reflect back onto the v3 issues that we had in 2011, what we really did there is we created a temporary discontinuity in the market. Because the market didn't have a channel of samples ready, and they had to change the way they ran the instruments. And so, partly, that's a reflection of a lesson we learned in terms of how to make sure we introduce these technologies in more piecemeal ways. But I don't think it's reflective of the capacity of the industry. That capacity is really only governed by how many dollars there are out there allocated toward sequencing. And if we can make greater capacity for the same dollars, that capacity will get absorbed. And so the goal we've had, always, is to continue to drive down the price of sequencing, because we think it enables new markets and makes the overall dollars that are coming into the market much, much larger as a result of enabling those new segments. And we're going to do that in lots of different ways, and part of it is by segmenting the market more. So there'll be, over the next few years, potentially more systems that address more targeted segments of the market. You can imagine now that we're involved in the NIPT market more directly, that we have the ability to begin to think about how do we optimize technology for specific kinds of tests. And ultimately, we'll decide whether that's an economic decision that makes sense, for us to more closely design an instrument for a family of particular test. That test, for example, uses only 25 base reads in most of the applications. And so it's slightly different than a general-purpose instrument. And so I think the way to think about this is that we will create more variations of the instruments over time that will be more specifically tailored to particular market segments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So on the new product side, post JPMorgan, I mean, you guys also have announcements on both sides of the business. Where did you see the most interest in terms of some of the advancements you had, both on HiSeq, MiSeq? And what was the response to the Moleculo concept?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I think the people probably expected us to continue to boost the output of the machines. So I think that was very well received. But in some ways, it's kind of always expected from us. I think that the one thing that we talked about at JPMorgan that got a huge reception was the Moleculo long-read technology. And in particular, because the PAG meeting, the Plant and Animal Genome meeting, was the next week, and the kinds of customers we have at the PAG meeting are those exact target customers for long read lengths. And so there was tremendous excitement about the ability to begin to address some of these more complex plant genomes, very large and non-diploid genomes using the Moleculo technology. So I think that was, in the short term, unexpected and of very high interest.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","For you, Christian, first question, you guys have been pretty nimble in the past around capacity expansions, and given the strong MiSeq order rate. Can you help us think about plans for expanding the production? How quickly could you work down the backlog?","Christian O. Henry","Yes, Bill, it's Christian. We will work down the backlog quickly. We have a very strong rate of production each week, but the demand was so strong in the fourth quarter. We were really limited by some of the raw materials coming in and not so much the capacity of the plant. And so as a result, we'll -- we've accelerated some of the receipts of raw materials, and we'll get back on track this quarter. That being said, having a bit of a backlog going into a particular quarter and possibly even exiting the first quarter, from a production perspective, isn't a bad thing because it allows you to balance your production between all of the products. Today, in our Hayward facility, we manufacture the HiSeq 2000, the 2500, the MiSeq. And so we're able to -- with that little bit of backlog we're able to balance the production across all of the product families. And so we're very fortunate to have higher, more demand than we were expecting. And it was really, at the end of the day, it was the raw materials coming in that precluded us from delivering everything we wanted to get out the door.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then just a couple of quick accounting questions. What does the guidance assume about sequestration? And then secondly, and maybe this one is specifically for Marc, how do we think about the Verinata accounting? Is that going to be accrual or cash based, or is it going to be cash and so, obviously, we start rolling up some reimbursement coverage.","Marc Stapley","Yes. So let me take the Verinata one. I mean, the way we're going to do that is, obviously, we're going to do it on a GAAP basis, is if we think the recoverability is reasonably assured, we take the revenue. But obviously, early on, that's not necessary the case and so we'll take revenue on a -- more of a cash basis.","Jay T. Flatley","With respect to NIH assumptions, sort of the baseline assumption that we have is a 2% to 4% decrease as a result of the sequestration -- or the solution sequestration is probably the better way to say that. I think we've consistently said that if it winds up being a flat budget, that's going to be upside opportunity for us. If it winds up sticking at the minus 8, that's probably some downside risk. But we think the chances of winding up at minus 8 are very small.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So I had just a few questions. Maybe just on the 50-person headcount investment, could you provide some details about the focal point for this increased sales force, maybe end markets, geographies? And kind of related to that, would this -- I mean, should we consider this as kind of building for maybe a multi-year future, or is this something that -- once you do this in 2014, is this something we should maybe expect as your demand increases in kind of clinical markets you might have to continue to step up the investment?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I would think about this largely as a 2013 step change. So the 50 is incremental to what we would have done otherwise. And I think we'll certainly invest heavily in clinical accounts or clinical sales type people in our TCG business. There will be some investments in sales force related to cytogenetics works that BlueGnome is doing. There will be some investments for going after new markets like forensics, and then there will be a general geographic add-on to try to increase our reach.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great, okay. And then maybe switching over to MiSeq. I know you -- I believe you gave guidance for pull-through, maybe of kind of $45,000 to $50,000. Could you just comment on -- I mean, it seems a little bit lower than I think, historically, maybe we heard in the past. And just kind of what you're seeing on kind of MiSeq pull-through? I would think there should be a lot of headroom on the upside. So what kind of utilization patterns are you seeing from customers?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, that $50,000 number is a number we've always targeted. And that was -- even at the time we first launched it, we said, \"Let's plan for $50,000.\" And that's about where it's come out. What we see in MiSeq is a very interesting pattern that has to do with the aging of the systems and we'll have to see over maybe the next year how this turns out. But clearly, as the systems become installed for greater and greater periods of time, the output on that particular system tends to go up. But because we're early in the product launch, we do have a very large number that are at the front end of that curve that are very low consumption because customers are developing assays or really beginning to think about how to deploy the technology. So we think, as we look forward maybe a year, there's a chance that, that number could begin to move up as more of these get put into production environments as clinical customers begin to use them routinely in labs. But I think for fiscal '13, using a number in that $50,000 range is probably the right place to be until we know otherwise.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then if could, on ovarian and gastric, Jay and Christian, any update there on how we should be thinking about timing for those colorectal?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, no update today on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jay, can you maybe give us a little color on how the economics for Verinata will work. As I understand it, you guys are handling the sales and marketing while Perkin is taking care of the billing. So just wondering if we can infer that you guys would maybe shoulder a little bit more than half the cost in exchange for more than half of revenue and earnings?","Jay T. Flatley","We can't give you the specifics of the agreement because those are confidential. But what I can say is that the actual sales efforts, at least in the near term, are going to be divided up. Verinata had a direct sales force. That direct sales force will stay in place. And PerkinElmer has their own sales force. So PerkinElmer will do sales, marketing into their channel and all the billing and reimbursement. But Verinata will also -- does have and will continue to have a direct sales operation as well.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. That is actually helpful. And then in terms of the future technology, chemistry A and B, any color you can provide on where those next-gen chemistry stand in development?","Jay T. Flatley","No, not a lot on that. I guess what I can say is that we've begun to work, as I've said publicly, in the area of nanopores. And so we have diverted some investment over toward nanopores, and we've continued to make unbelievable progress on SBS. And so if you look at sort of the ratio of dollars being spent on alternative chemistries, it's probably shifted a little bit away from A and B just because we're making such great progress on SBS, and we're working on nanopores in addition.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, if I can just sneak in one last one on BaseSpace. Maybe comment a little bit on what percentage of the installed base is actively using the technology and what the investment is eventually going to get by the end of this year once you've got the entire platform theoretically enabled? And just any color on the App Store pull-through and so forth?","Jay T. Flatley","On MiSeq, right now, we have about 70% of the customers connected. And we think that is pretty close to the theoretical number. I mean, it may inch up a little bit from there. But there's a fraction of the installed base that just does not allow to be connected to the Internet, and so that will never be 100% no matter how well we do. Of that 70% that are connected, I believe the current number that's uploading data is about half of them. Half of the 70% are actively uploading their actual data runs. Most all of the 70% are uploading the health information, and so we are being able to use this in very powerful ways now to sort of watch the quality metrics in the field on an aggregate basis and diagnose problems earlier. It's an incredibly powerful tool for us. On the HiSeq front, it's really too early to know, because it's just began really around December 1 with the shipments of the first 2500s. And as I've said previously, we expect the connection rate of HiSeqs to be slower in the installed base, because everybody who owned the HiSeq previously already has some local IT infrastructure to support it. And so they either have to give that up or begin to switch over time to the use of BaseSpace. And so that migration in the HiSeq front will be slower.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swan.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","On the price increase front, I think Marc mentioned you're going to issue another price increase in the second quarter. So I wanted to confirm that and also and get some color around your thinking around consumables pricing going forward.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, that's right. We've notified our customers of a small price increase that will take effect on April 1. And with respect to other price increases, that's -- those are the only ones we've announced. There's nothing more.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And Jay, is this similar to the prior price increase where customers could avoid it by pre-buying our pre-ordering a certain -- committing to a certain volume in advance to that?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, they can in the sense that they can -- if they want to front-load orders in Q1, they can do that. We're not going to prevent them from ordering under the existing pricing, and if they do that before the price increase takes effect, we'll honor that order. But recall that, that doesn't affect revenue. It only affects orders, because those orders will be shipped out on whatever shipment schedule they put in with the order. So there's no revenue impact in Q1.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","And then lastly, really quick, you mentioned you're rolling out -- the full rollout of your e-commerce channel is going to occur in Q2. Can you qualitatively help us understand what kind of e-commerce contribution you have in your forecast? Is it still pretty minimal or immaterial at this point, or do you think it will be something more than that?","Jay T. Flatley","Let me clarify my remarks a bit there, because the e-commerce comment I made was with respect only with the BaseSpace. Yes, so this has to do with the fact that we're beginning to put apps up but we put them up initially for free so customers can use them as we bring up the e-commerce infrastructure, which will take effect in Q2. The answer to the opportunity size there is a hard one. We have very broad models internally about what the app rate usage might look like. All sorts of assumptions that, frankly, are all over the map, if you will. And so it's hard for us to predict right now what the usage rates are going to be. And so I think we've decided to just wait and actually see what it is rather than spend too much time trying to predict it at this point.","Christian O. Henry","I think one thing that's exciting, though, is we have, what is it, over 120, or well over 100 developers that are developing software for BaseSpace. So it will be interesting to see how that monetizes itself out over time.","Jay T. Flatley","So that number is the number of people who downloaded the development kit. So it's a little hard to know exactly how -- what fraction of that 125 will actually be producing apps, but it's a good sign.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with USB (sic) [UBS].","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just following up on sequencing cost. Jay, how important do you think it's going to be to complete on the $1,000 genome price point this year? Obviously, what you get for a particular price varies between platforms, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the way that you think customers will look at cost per sample this year as some new products are rolled out.","Jay T. Flatley","I think the $1,000 price point does have a magical ring to it in a lot of people's minds, particularly because it's been talked about so aggressively for so long. I don't think the market's going to get to the $1,000 price point this year if you do the math the way we do the math. And I just don't think any technology is going to get to the $1,000 price. In '14, I think it's certainly possible. When we do the calculation, we include reagents, instrument amortization in that by informatic storage and processing of the data through a pipeline that at least gets you the variance. And the only we don't include when we do that math is the overhead, because overhead can vary from institution to institution and be widely affected by other things that, that entity is doing. So if you add up all those other components, besides overhead, the $1,000 is not going to happen at '13, I don't think.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just on Verinata, where is production capacity now relative to test uptake? And I guess as you think about taking verifi to a broader audience, is expansion there at all a consideration in the near or maybe midterm?","Jay T. Flatley","We built the laboratory to be very easily expandable. So if you look at any of the workstations and the workflow that they've set up, they can expand very significantly relatively quickly. And clearly, on the sequencing side, that's not an issue now either because we can presumably close the deal. It's very easy for us to add incremental sequencers when we need to. So I don't capacity is going to be any challenge for them.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then quickly, Marc, maybe just one quick one for you. Did you sort of give a tax rate for '13 that we should think about? And if you didn't, then would you be willing to comment there?","Marc Stapley","Yes, we said we think that the pro forma tax rate for next year being around 31%. And Dan, just to clarify, I mean included in that is the 2012 R&D tax credit that we didn't recognize this -- in 2012 and the prior year, we'll take that in Q1.","Jay T. Flatley","If I should give some kudos to our operations team for all the hard work of moving these products over to Singapore. It's been a couple of years of front-end investment as we move the [indiscernible] property there and made the investments to actually bring up the manufacturing infrastructure. But now we're starting to see that begin to pay significant dividends and so all that hard work is paying off.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So just a couple I had here, one in terms of the MiSeq Dx. What's your sense in terms of sort of the internal time line for obtaining FDA clearance there? And is there anything you can share just in terms of how the discussions are going so far?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, to my knowledge, we've not gotten back our first response from the FDA. I guess that could have happened the last few days and I don't know about it. But at least, to my knowledge, we've not heard from them yet. Our default assumption is that would be some time in the second quarter, unless there's some significant issue that pops up. That will be a typical time line, and we just don't know which month it would happen in the second quarter. I do think we will put out a press release when that occurs, and that will be significant event for us. And we'll announce it when it happens.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of the clinical customers, obviously, we've talked a lot about oncology and reproductive health. Are you seeing much use with the MiSeq, so far, in other areas besides those 2? I guess talking about infectious diseases or in some of these other areas, or is it pretty much just limited to those 2 for now?","Jay T. Flatley","I mean, usage is quite broad. It's across -- we're seeing it in microbiology, in virology, certainly in infectious disease. We think cancer and reproductive health are the biggest short-term and the fastest-growing parts of the market. But I think it will be used quite broadly and into forensics as well. So...","Christian O. Henry","On the food testing, with the FDA, big order we announced last quarter.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Great. Just one last quick one, if I could. In terms of the tax rate again, just is there anything -- you mentioned the first quarter, we'll get some of the impact from the R&D tax credit. So is there any number you could assist us with there in terms of what we should think for the first quarter?","Marc Stapley","It'll be something like 50 basis points for the year, set for the year.","Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So will the Q1 impact be the catch-up from '12?","Marc Stapley","Well, Q1 impact for that fiscal year will be set for about [indiscernible] will probably bring the tax rate down about 300 basis points, I would think, in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Question for Marc. Marc, ERP changes are never typically short-term projects, and you mentioned the $10 million investment in 2013. Can you talk about the timing of the project going forward and how you're planning on adding additional investments beyond 2013?","Marc Stapley","Yes, just -- there's a couple of things to clarify. The $10 million isn't necessarily related just to the ERP project. But it's related to the couple of programs that Jay talked about. The time of that project -- so that was the investment for 2013. But we think of that as a 2- to 3-program overall, the ERP. So I think about from 3 years -- within about 3 years from now, we'll be done with the final implementation of whatever solution we end up deciding to go with.","Jay T. Flatley","And I think the focus in 2013 is largely going to be on defining the business processes, the core business processes, selecting the system and then beginning to plan for implementation there. It's very unlikely we'd actually begin implementation in 2013.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just the second...","Marc Stapley","As you get into the implementation, of course, some of your spend is capitalized and there's mix between capitalization and OpEx will change and then it will come back in depreciation over the life of the solution that you've implemented.","Christian O. Henry","Right. One of the things we're trying to do, though, is to the extent as we go through the process exercise, we can find quick wins. That's a key objective of ours, particularly, as we start to work towards driving gross -- continue to drive gross margin up.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And a follow-up question on nanopore. Qualitatively, what's the incremental level of increase in R&D spending you're putting towards nanopores this year, since I can imagine that you're just starting the work in this area, so what's the incremental level of increased R&D?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we've not disclosed what it was before or what the increment is. And I don't think we'll get to that level of granularity. But what we can say is that our investment in nanopore technology, really, was focused on our partnership with Oxford Nanopore until that partnership went in a different direction. So we weren't working on it previously, that our focus was on working with Oxford.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wasn't asking for a number. I was just thinking more in terms of, are you doubling it? Are you tripling it? Just to get a sense of your R&D focus.","Marc Stapley","Yes, we're not going to subdivide it any further.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just if I can add a couple of clarifying ones. But actually, I have a technology question that [indiscernible] or something. But so one is on the share count. Are you assuming a certain amount of buybacks, just because, basically, it looks like you're assuming no dilution for the year, but, obviously, you've been issuing quite a bit of stock comp.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. Jon, we're just assuming -- there's a couple of things. Remember, we have about just over $165 million, I think, it is left in the program. We still have the discretionary plan dialed in and that will continue to operate throughout this year. And then -- no, I'm sorry, the 10b5-1 plan. And we still have the discretionary element, as well, that we could utilize as and when we need to. That would all be assumed. Anything we plan to do, that would be assumed in our guidance.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then one more quick one on the guidance. Are you -- I mean, maybe you can just talk about what your utilization expectations are. And are you anticipating instruments will be up in 2013? And I guess, Jay, like, normally you've given a wider range of guidance, now you're just kind of saying 15%. But what do you think the kind of the variance around that guidance is, is it 15%, plus or minus 1%, 2%? Just maybe help us out there.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we're not going to get any more specific, Jon, than the number we picked. And so we thought long and hard about how to present it best, and this is how we decided to do it. You could assume some bands around the 15%, and I think that where we're going to stick in terms of any specifics is at the 15% level. So we think that's a great number for us going forward, and we're optimistic that we can wind up in that range.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And just on the instruments, you expect those to be up, and what's your utilization expectations, kind of within that range you've given, is it just the midpoint of those ranges that you gave for your annual ranges that you set, is your expectation the midpoint of that for 2013?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, remember how -- the logical way that we would calculate guidance is to look at all the variables in our business, to map them all out on one end of the scale, map them all out the other way and upside downside and see how broad that range is and then decide what the sort of probabilistic thing is in the middle. And so the growth -- the numbers we gave doesn't assume a single-point assumption on every factor in there. It assumes a wide range of how any one factor could vary, whether instrument placements or utilization. And we look at that entire model and decide what the right guidance number is. So it doesn't assume a point number for utilization of instrument consumables.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's fair. And a quick technology question for you, Jay, is -- I'm pretty fascinated on this -- I think it was a few weeks ago in your release, but you mentioned today, again, on the MiSeq, that you're now doing exome. Just my conversation with a lot of users previously was that you just didn't have enough reads on the MiSeq, because I think your reads are still around 15 million and you're increasing the read length. But now, I think you said that with 4 to 6G, you're able to do an exome. So just curious kind of how -- what you've gotten around, or what allows you to do exomes on MiSeq?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, the amount of total output, really, is what determines what you can do in exomes. And it's not as much limited by the number of tags. It's not a counting application, it's a sequencing output application. And we're pushing MiSeqs in the field, are really running at 8-plus G, and we're moving that up to 15G. So that's going to have enough output to do exome.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Aren't most exomes 100 base pairs -- like 100, 120 base pairs long?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, it depends on what your kit creates when you're done, right? And we do them paired-end, so we read both directions. And so it's not a counting application.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","All right. I was just curious, a little different, then, what some of the people have said, but I think that's a big move if you can get some good data there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","This is Eric Criscuolo filling in for Peter. Just on the -- on your academic customers, have you seen any change in their tone or their outlook, positively or negatively, within the past several months?","Jay T. Flatley","No. We said in the script that our customers had very stable behavior, very stable ordering rates. And we -- we're surprised, actually, how unaffected they seem to be by any of the macro conditions or the sequestration risk that still hangs out there. Obviously, we've been very pleased by that response.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","All right. Great. And then on the gross margins, can we maybe see that just improve sequentially as 2013 goes on? Or is there going to be kind of a year-end improvement more than the first half of the year?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I mean, our goal, of course, is to continue to make quarter-to-quarter progress on gross margins. That doesn't always happen, because there are onetime things that happen in any given quarter, some of which wash out in the upside and the downside. But the goal will be to continue to march gross margins up on a regular basis if we can.","Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, the service gross margins, is there a target that you're looking for, like the steady-state or a full year margin number? Because that's kind of bouncing around a little and it is dilutive to your overall margins.","Jay T. Flatley","It is, yes, and as the service goes up, there's a fraction of revenue that's, as Marc mentioned, a bit of a downdraft on the quarter gross margins. We don't have a limit to what we think we can do there. I mean, our -- we're continuing to work to drive them up, and there's no short-term target. But we're working to make them better. That's on both sides, both on pricing and on the cost side.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Rebecca Chambers for closing remarks.","Rebecca Chambers","Thank you.

","With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.","Francis deSouza ","Thank you, Jacquie. And good afternoon, everyone. The second quarter represented another strong performance for Illumina with record revenue of $830 million, up 25% from the second quarter of 2017. Before we get into the detail, I'd like to thank the global Illumina team for the solid execution in the first half of 2018. Genomic information is more valuable and actionable than ever before and it is to the team\u2019s credit that we continue to move quickly, embrace new opportunities and find innovative ways to support our customers. As a result, our business is growing as we enable a broad range of drivers, spanning applications, systems and geographies. ","In the last five years, we estimate that over 225 petabytes of sequence data have been generated on Illumina platforms alone. That volume of sequence data is roughly equivalent to 2.5 human genomes sequence of 30x coverage. ","Despite this impressive repository of sequence data, to-date we have only ascribed significance to less than 1% of the variance catalog in the human genome. So it's clear that the vast majority of opportunity remains ahead of us, not only in terms of sequencing volumes, but even more importantly in terms of advancing our understanding of the genome and our ability to positively impact human life. ","I will now update you on our business in the second quarter. Reflecting stronger than expected demand, second quarter sequencing consumable revenue of $455 million grew 35% from the same quarter a year ago. This includes about $13 million of stocking associated with Chinese customers buying ahead of potential tariffs. Excluding this, growth was 31%. ","Second quarter sequencing consumable growth was broad-based with customers in research, translational and clinical settings, all contributing significantly. We're seeing robust growth as our customers leverage genomics to drive discoveries, connect data to insight and routinely apply genomic tests in clinical and applied markets, whether it is to uncover new insights in Parkinson's or diabetes or to establish the utility of circulating tumor DNA for early cancer diagnosis, our customers are increasing using sequencing as the primary tool to advance our understanding of the genome and improve patient outcomes. ","Highlighting this breath of drivers across our sequencing business, we saw consumable growth across all three sequencing system categories; high throughput, which includes NovaSeq and HiSeq; mid throughput, which is NextSeq; and low throughput, which includes MiniSeq, MiSeq, iSeq. ","NovaSeq consumables grew $40 million sequentially, with continued strong adoption of S4 and S2 and a healthy ramp in the S1 flow cell launched in February. As we expected, NovaSeq growth was partially offset by lower HiSeq consumables, although the HiSeq 4000 consumables remained an area of strength. ","Overall, sequencing consumable use is ramping faster than we expected. In total, high throughput consumables grew more than 35% from the same quarter a year ago. It is now approaching $1 billion annual run rate and a sizable majority of HiSeq customers, who have added at least one NovaSeq system, have increased their total spend on consumables. ","As a result, our full year expectation for NovaSeq-related revenue is exceeding the internal forecast we set at the start of year. It was also a strong quarter for NextSeq consumables with growing demand across VeriSeq NIPT, oncology research, translational activity and clinical oncology testing. ","Mid throughput consumables grew more than 50% from the same quarter a year ago, demonstrating that the NextSeq continues to be an important sequencing workforce supporting a broad range of applications. Pull-through persistence exceeded the high-end of our $100,000 to a $150,000 guidance range. ","We saw a sequential and year-over-year growth in our lower throughput sequencing consumables which support our MiSeq and MiniSeq systems with pull-through within their expected ranges. Today, these systems represent more than 10% of our sequencing consumable business. ","Finally, library prep grew 25% from the same quarter a year ago, driven by our core library prep portfolio, including traction with our new Nextera DNA Flex offering, which continues to receive positive customer feedback. Our library prep portfolio is now approaching 15% of our sequencing consumable business. ","Sequencing system revenue grew 10% sequentially to a $123 million, up as we expected from a seasonally lighter first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the broad appeal of NovaSeq. Globally, more than 200 different labs have received a NovaSeq system with demand driven by capacity expansion, HiSeq conversion and new to high throughput customers. ","The broad appeal and utility of the NovaSeq system is further reflected by the mix of flow cells customers are using, with most ordering a combination of two or more of the available flow cells. Overall growth in NovaSeq consumables spanning S1, S2 and S4 has been faster than we anticipated and the feedback consistent performance continued to be positive. We expect NovaSeq shipments in the 330 to 350 unit range for this year. ","Moving to the rest of our sequencing system portfolio, NextSeq shipments grew sequentially with a good mix of capacity expansion and new to NextSeq customers. Combined low throughput systems placements increased sequentially and year-over-year with strong adoption by new to sequencing customers who represented over 50% of shipments from this group in the second quarter. ","I'm pleased to share that we started shipping iSeq to customers in late Q2. Early order activity has been robust with a good mix of new and existing customers in both academic and commercial settings. As a standard Illumina practice, we will ramp production in the coming months. ","Sequencing services and other revenue had another strong quarter, up 10% sequentially and 38% year-over-year to $106 million. Roughly half of this total dollar amount is associated with traditional maintenance contracts. The rest is primarily associated with our sequencing services labs which support Genomics England in addition to some NIPT and rugged customers.","Genomics England had a particularly strong quarter as it targets completion of its $100,000 genome project later this year. Additionally, we also reported the contribution from our oncology partners, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Loxo Oncology. Both programs completed their first full quarter of work and are progressing well in their co-development and commercialization objectives. ","There has been a good collaboration between our teams and that of our partners demonstrating ongoing commitments to our shared vision of bringing transformative insights for targeted and immunotherapies to patients. We are particularly encouraged by positive feedback from key opinion leaders on an early version of the TruSight Oncology 500 assay. ","Moving to arrays, microarray revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $140 million, with growth not only in the direct-to-consumer or DTC but also in global research applications spanning genotyping and epigenetics. Growth was strong in all regions, including China where the launch of the Asian Screening Array helped drive a large number of iScan installations in Q2 which indicates future growth for arrays in the region has sites scale their operations. ","We also secured our largest single order for the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip as we drive larger epigenome wide association studies in the translational research market. While sequentially microarray revenue was down associated with DTC functionality, we foresee robust demand for arrays as DTC broadens across geographies, applications and providers as precision medicine initiatives expand and research and applied uses for arrays increase. ","Moving to regional results, Americas revenue grew 19% versus the prior year period, driven by growth in sequencing consumables and microarrays. EMEA continues to be an exciting market for Illumina and now represents about a quarter of our total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 36% from the same quarter a year ago with a strong contribution associated with the Genomics England program that has now sequenced more than 70,000 co-genomes. We also saw initial NovaSeq purchases from the Wellcome Sanger Institute as they prepare for their first 50,000 samples that will be sequenced as part of the UK Biobank program. ","Total Asia Pacific revenue grew 32% year-over-year with another strong quarter from greater China, which delivered shipment growth of 42% from last year and 45% sequentially. Even excluding the $13 million stocking order, China reported record shipments in Q2. ","Illumina has a number of very strong sequencing service provider partners in China and their growth continues to be driven by NIPT and research based sequencing in a variety of areas including oncology and reproductive health. Outside of China, the rest of Asia Pacific and Japan or APJ was driven in large part by increasing volumes at our service provider customers and ramping ahead of precision medicine initiatives. ","In addition to robust sequencing consumable growth, APJ also reported strong array growth, driven by a small but rapidly growing DTC customer offering that test serviced across Asia that is based on our screening array. ","Before I hand the call over to Sam, I'd like to formally welcome the Edico team that moved to Illumina headquarters at the beginning of June and is already proving to be an integral part of the product development group. ","Together, we are now focused on delivering the most complete offering of accelerated secondary analysis solutions for all our customers. We're confident that our proprietary FPGA acceleration will improve time to answer on workflows across research, translational and clinical applications and look forward to updating you on the team's progress in the quarters ahead. ","With that, I'll hand the call over to Sam for a review of our quarterly financials. Sam?","Sam Samad","Thanks, Francis. As discussed, second quarter revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $830 million, driven largely by growth in sequencing consumables that once again exceeded forecast. ","We also saw a strong performance in both microarray and sequencing services and the contribution associated with our oncology collaborations. Additionally, benefit from foreign exchange rates contributed 2% to the year-over-year growth. ","Total instrument revenue in the second quarter was a $127 million, down 7% year-over-year and up 8% sequentially, instrument revenue therefore represented 15% of total revenue in the quarter. Consumable revenue was $540 million, up 7% sequentially and 34% year-over-year. Services and other revenue was a $157 million, basically flat sequentially and up 32% year-over-year. ","In 2008, instruments represented 33% in consumables and other represented 67% of our revenue. In the second quarter of 2018, consumables and services represented 84% of total revenue, highlighting how the mix of our business has evolved. ","Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share are referred to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders. ","Non GAAP gross margin of 70.3% was higher than expected and increased 50 basis points compared to the first quarter and 330 basis points compared to last year. The increases were primarily due to higher mix of sequencing consumables, which represented 55% of revenue in the second quarter of 2018, and compares to 53% in the first quarter of 2018 and to 51% in the second quarter of 2017. ","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $348 million were up $32 million from last quarter, largely reflecting higher R&D investments, headcount additions and increased variable compensation expense. ","Keep in mind the first quarter operating expenses were lower-than-expected due to the timing of certain investments and headcount additions, in addition to a favorable judgment on patent suit. ","Non GAAP operating margin was therefore 28.4%, down from 29.5% last quarter. Excluding Helix, operating margin was 30.6% compared to 31.9% last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 15.9% compares to 12.9% last quarter and to 25.1% in the second quarter of 2017. Positively impacting the Q2 \u201818 tax rate was an additional benefit related to our Helix investment and a favorable 2017 foreign tax return adjustment. Excluding the Helix benefit, non GAAP tax rate would have been 16.9%. ","For the second quarter of 2018, GAAP net income was $209 million or $1.41 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $212 million or $1.43 per diluted share. The impact of foreign exchange increased Q2 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.03 relative to last year. ","Cash flow from operations was $295 million. Improved revenue linearity led to a record DSO of 43 days compared to 47 days last quarter. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $77 million and Q2 free cash flow was $218 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. ","Moving to guidance, total company revenue is now expected to grow at approximately 20% in 2018 to $3.3 billion. This represents an increase of a $124 million compared to the midpoint of our previous 15% to 16% guidance range. Compared to our previous guidance, the new growth expectation reflects higher sequencing consumables reported in the first half and an increase in the sequencing consumable forecast for the rest of 2018, notably associated with NovaSeq. We continue to expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be up modestly from 2017.","Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue are now expected to be slightly lower in 2018 versus the 43.5% reported in 2017. This is primarily due to a higher revenue outlook and slower growth in headcount than anticipated. ","Reflecting another more modest Helix benefit in the second quarter and the favorable taxe return adjustment, we now expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 16% and 17% for the full year. On a go forward basis, you should expect a tax rate of approximately 19%.","We continue to monitor the tariff situation closely in China. As noted earlier, three of our larger customers initiated some stocking purchases in the second quarter and we expect to see additional stocking activity, albeit to a lesser extent in the third quarter. ","Beyond possible near-term variability in the timing of orders like we saw in the second quarter, we are confident that customers will continue to see the benefit of partnering with Illumina to deliver their own genomics-based services and products.","GAAP EPS is now expected to be between $5.10 and $5.20 and non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be between $5.35 and $5.45. This increase primarily reflects the higher revenue projection for the full year, improved gross margin and a more favorable non-GAAP tax rate than previously projected. ","For the full year, we are still expecting about $0.25 of Helix dilution. This excludes the previously mentioned tax benefit that resulted from our latest investment rounds in Helix that positively impacted Q1 and to a lesser extent Q2. We continue to expect share count for the full year to be approximately 148 million.","For the third quarter, specifically, we expect revenue to be flat to slightly up from Q2. Keep in mind the $13 million stocking order that effectively pulled revenue from later periods into the second quarter. As a result, we expect a more modest sequential increase in sequencing consumables, and we expect sequencing system revenue growth. ","Offsetting these positive revenue impacts in part, we expect the raise to be down meaningfully on a sequential basis. This is primarily driven by seasonality in DTC and in fact, we expect Q3 to be the lowest revenue quarter of the year. And after the positive benefit we saw in Q1 and Q2 of this year, you should expect FX to have less of an impact in the back half.","We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be down modestly on a sequential basis to reflect the impact of mix. And we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to increase sequentially on a percentage of revenue basis, given our expected hiring and investment plans.","With that, I'll hand the call back to Francis.","Francis deSouza","Thank you, Sam. This was a very strong quarter for Illumina. And looking ahead, the opportunity for genomics continues to grow. With so much left to learn about the genome, research remains an important driver of our business. In fact, four of our 10 largest sequencing consumable customers in the second quarter are primarily focused on research, either directly or as a CRO. And their combined demand grew faster than the overall sequencing consumable growth rate in the quarter.","The consumer genomics market continues to extend its reach with some promising developments in China, Korea and Japan this quarter, in addition to continued momentum in our DTC array customers and Helix. ","In oncology, we saw Guardant Health receive the first -- the final Medicare Coverage policy for an NGS-based liquid biopsy assay for certain non-small cell lung cancer patients. We are seeing growing interest in tumor mutational burden or TMB which is emerging as one of the best NGS-based predictors of response to cancer immunotherapies. Germany is expected to be the first company to formalize reimbursement for TMB once the national study is completed in the fall. And we\u2019ve been seeing strong interest in our NextSeq system as a result. ","We continue to see the NIPT opportunity growing with expansion into new geographies and broadening coverage. NIPT was acknowledged as beneficial, as a primary screening tool for trisomy 21 in Germany during the quarter, opening the discussion for potential reimbursement in 2019. And in the US, we are watching to see whether ACOG will further revise its guidelines regarding use of NIPT for average-risk pregnancies, following the withdrawal of Committee Opinion 640 that was issued in 2015. ","This growing interest in population genomics initiatives highlighting the governments all over the world are recognizing the value of genomic studies to enable precision medicine that could improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare systems. ","In the second quarter alone, we saw all of us begin enrollments in the United States, a large UK Biobank study awarded and announcements from Genome Canada and the Australian government among others. While these programs typically take several years to ramp from initial interest to begin sequencing at scale, they represent exciting multi-year opportunities for us and our customers.","We will now open the call to questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Go ahead with your question, Derik.","Derik de Bruin ","Just a little bit clarity on the 13 million stocking order. Is it across all the different sequencing categories, all the different sequencing instruments? And I\u2019m just wondering if it was more heavily weighted to NovaSeq or if it was tied to -- just -- or was it spread across, just a little bit more color on what\u2019s going on in the after-market? ","Francis deSouza","Sure. The $13 million stocking order was primarily focused on NovaSeq, however, was a little bit of NextSeq in there too. ","Operator","And moving on to our next question we got Ross Muken from Evercore. Go ahead with your question Ross.","Ross Muken ","So maybe if we think about all the various areas of application or end market where we\u2019re seeing a sort of dramatic uptick on the NovaSeq side, where are you seeing the most sort of surprising level of interesting growth? And if we think about kind of the mix today, clinical research and some of the more translational areas, what is that looking like on kind of the incremental basis as we think about where the growth upside from utilization is coming from, as to how that\u2019s exchanging?","Francis deSouza","Yes, sure. There are a number of things that we expected to play out with NovaSeq that we\u2019re seeing and there are definitely a couple of surprises. One thing that we did expect to play out was that NovaSeq would fundamentally unlock some elasticity in the market. And one of the things that we were looking for was validation that customers who purchased a NovaSeq in addition to their other high throughput systems were anyhow buying more consumables from us, that would validate a theory that they would open up bigger cohorts, more access to sample and that\u2019s certainly how it\u2019s playing out. So that was sort of a core driver of NovaSeq and that\u2019s playing out well.","Obviously, we are seeing a lot of whole genome work being done on NovaSeq as we expected some of the big service provider customers of ours have been on the commercial side, certainly have been some of these earliest adopters and some of the fastest to ramp up the NovaSeq installation. So we expected to see that and that\u2019s playing out. ","What maybe we didn\u2019t expect that we saw was quite the number of new to high throughput customers that emerged in both the NovaSeq pipeline and then as NovaSeq customers. And so, that\u2019s been a pretty robust consistent number of quarter-after-quarter now. And so that frankly was an upside surprise for us. And as we talked about the NovaSeq consumable pull through has been also an upside surprise for us that customers are more quickly unlocking more samples and are more quickly ramping up their NovaSeq utilization. And so all that has sort of added up to as a theme that our NovaSeq revenues for the year, across consumables and instruments, is going to be greater than we expected for the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from J.P. Morgan. Go ahead with your question.","Tycho Peterson","I want to ask about some of the benefits you guys had. Can you quantify the tariff pull forward but I think we'll probably get questions about maybe some of the milestones around Bristol and Loxo and then GeL which was going to tail off a bit in the back half of the year potentially? So as we think about the guidance range for the back half of the year a couple of things, can you talk about picks and those are headwinds and what you are baking in for additional tariff impact? Is there anything embedded for some of the newer products like Edico and the new closed sales? And then how much of a headwind or GeL and maybe some of these companion diagnostic deal milestones that won't necessarily repeat?","Francis deSouza","Yes, so there definitely have been some collaboration income or collaboration revenues I should say that we realized in Q2. We expect that to continue in the back half of the year as well Tycho for our earlier guidance, albeit probably to a smaller or lesser extent than what we saw in Q2. We saw a good quarter from GeL. We expect to see continued GeL revenues as well as they ramp up to achieve the 100,000 genome milestone that they have. ","So overall -- and in terms of the tariff question that you had, as we talked about in our prior prepared remarks, we saw $13 million stocking orders that we saw in Q2. We do expect some timing shift with regard to potential order placements of consumables ahead of potential tariffs in the back half of the year but that\u2019s not material. So there isn\u2019t really anything material to talk about in terms of major shift because of tariffs. So we saw that in Q2, we expect to see maybe a little bit of it in Q3 but nothing really that material to impact sales.","And then with regards to I think your last point was around the NovaSeq consumable, the S1, S2, S4 flow cells that we have, as we talked about in our prepared remarks as well, part of our guidance raise is driven by the fact that we expect increased consumables revenues from NovaSeq. So it\u2019s reflected in our guidance range.","Sam Samad","Yes, that\u2019s right, and if I would add, if you think about GeL, clearly GeL is working to wrap the 100,000 genome project and we are in the tip of that but GeL is also looking now to transition to the second stage of their journey where they are actually building in genomic testing into the NHS and really moving into clinical standard-of-care or things like rugged. And so, obviously there will be a transition. But if we think long-term, that could actually unlock a bigger revenue opportunity long-term than the trajectory we\u2019re on now with them. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Go ahead with your question Doug. Doug, are you still there? I think Douglas dropped off. We will move on to Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead with your question. ","Patrick Donnelly ","Great, thanks. Maybe just one on China. I know you mentioned kind of the oncology and we reproductive health markets kind of shaping up there. Can you just also talk through, I know consumer genomics has started to pick up, seeing some -- is getting state-of-the-market in China, which markets you\u2019re most excited about over the next six to 12 months there? ","Francis deSouza","Yes. So China continues to be as you can imagine a very exciting market for us. It is already our second largest country in market. And as we look at the drivers, we feel very good about the prospects for continued growth in China, driven on the one hand I think what you talked about which is our NIPT business, still have headroom in front of it there, obviously oncology and oncology testing in the very early stages are penetrating that market. But there are number of other markets that are emerging and one that's definitely interesting is the direct-to-consumer opportunity. And the launch of the Global Screening Array has helped drive up opportunities for DTC for us in China. It\u2019s already led to a number of iScan patients in China and they were a number of companies that we\u2019re seeing now or ramping up their DTC capabilities there, including WeGene who was going to utilize our microarray technology to provide complete ancestry analysis service to 56 major ethnic groups in China. And other company in China as an example is working on an EWAS study in the second half of 2018, with the intention to launch a DTC based study on offering on methylation. And so, we\u2019re definitely seeing the emergence of the DTC segments, although still at very early stages in China. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Doug, go ahead. ","Doug Schenkel ","So with consumables revenue per NovaSeq has continued to ramp HiSeq and HiSeq X utilization instruct a bit but it\u2019s probably been a bit more durable than many of us expected, relatively HiSeq and HiSeq X retirements don\u2019t seem to have scaled a whole lot even as you place more and more NovaSeqs. So with that in mind, over the balance of the year, what\u2019s your expectation for NovaSeqs impacting or your HiSeq installed base of instruments and the use of these instruments that remain in the field? And looking beyond this year, once more projects are completed, do you expect the pace of retirements to increase in the amount of spend for the HiSeq and X to drop? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Sure, Doug. So I will start by validating the number of points that you made. One, we are pleased in the ramp-up that we\u2019re seeing in terms of the utilization of NovaSeq instruments that are out in the field, and we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in terms of pull through of NovaSeq, although it\u2019s too early to call that definitive range but we are pleased with what we are seeing so far.","We are also seeing though in some cases that there are customers that have validated workflows on a HiSeq that will continue to run on HiSeq for a while before they transition on to NovaSeq. And that\u2019s part of the design that we laid out in terms of having this multi-year transition into NovaSeq. And so the dynamics that will play out over the coming quarters and years is we will start to see some of those clinical customers validate their workflows on NovaSeq and transition over to NovaSeq. We will also see some of the larger HiSeq X fleets start the cut over to NovaSeq. So they have begun that journey but we are still in the early stages of people being to complete cutover onto NovaSeq. And so that\u2019s still in front of us and that will drive the demand for NovaSeqs going forward.","I don\u2019t expect to see any sharp acceleration in that transition. I expect it to see more measured over the years and that is how we\u2019ve laid it out, it\u2019s also how we staged the flow cells. So coming out with S2 at the beginning, then S4 in the fall of last year and then S1 in Q1 of this year and each of those flow cells is intended to catalyze different segments of the HiSeq base, right. So S4 is really targeting the high throughput genome centers and looking to prompt in the coming quarters a cutover from X that\u2019s one that\u2019s obviously the lower end of that segment to move customers that might have been still on the 2500 for example. And so that's how we staged the rollout of the flow cells and that\u2019s how we expect it to play.","Sam Samad","Yes, I\u2019ll just add a couple of quick comments Doug as well just for completeness. We have always said this is going to be a multi-year upgrade cycle and that\u2019s how it\u2019s playing out. And with regards to customers, they are transitioning at their own pace. And we are more than happy to see customers transition as they see the need to. So that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to play out.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sung Ji Nam from BTIG.","Sung Ji Nam","Just not to deliver the point on tariff but I was wondering in terms of the stocking activity. Is that just out of abundance of caution and also are you seeing that outside of China as well?","Sam Samad","Yes. The stocking activity that we saw in Q2 was purely related to China and for a handful of customers in China. And as Francis mentioned earlier, mostly on NovaSeq, some orders of NextSeq as well. So at this point we are seeing that in China only. And truth of the matter is we are still monitoring developments on the tariffs point and what's going to happen. So we are still looking forward to see what's -- how this is going to play out. As I said, we don't expect major shifts in terms of ordering and placement activity. We see this to be fairly immaterial in terms of our overall sales.","And the last thing I\u2019ll say on this is, sequencing technology is a big investment and one that is not easily redirected. Our customers take this seriously. And so, as we look forward and as we stay and stay close to the whole tariff situation, obviously we are going to continue to watch it closely and we are going to also do what's best for our customers as we look forward.","Francis deSouza","Yes, so just add to what Sam said, look, ultimately demand in China is driven by the customer demand and the strength of our technology. And we continue to expect both to be strong and sort of drive the business for us there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citi Group. Go ahead with your question Dan.","Dan Arias","Looking at you, Francis, if maybe you could provide the revenue or the system growth number for oncology during the quarter, as we sort of track momentum there? And then maybe more broadly but along those lines, I know it's hard for you guys to pinpoint applications sometimes. But as we\u2019re sort of contemplating this inflection, now it seems like it\u2019s taking place. I\u2019m wondering if you could just sort of help us as to what percentage of revenues may be roughly speaking are now coming from clinical work, how much falls into that bucket at this point? ","Francis deSouza","Yes. So we don\u2019t actually break out the revenue down to the level of systems placed in the oncology market. But what I can say at a very top level is that the percentage of our overall revenues that come from the clinical market, last year was about 45% and that continues to be strong. And so, you\u2019ve seen that grow now over the last few years as both oncology and NIPT have driven the growth of both consumables and system placements into those clinical markets. Some of the things that are playing out in the clinical market, we continue to see strong translational demand for our products. And then more recently as we announced companion diagnostic deals with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Loxo, that\u2019s starting to generate revenue, and we expect that to continue. And then one exciting development for the future is the emergence of tumor mutation burden as a biomarker predictive of the effectiveness of immunotherapies, and that could be an exciting driver to add fuel to the oncology market for us.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Bill, you can go ahead with your questions.","Bill Quirk ","First off, Francis, I really appreciate the color around both Genome England as well as Sanger\u2019s efforts around population sequencing. Can you talk to some of the other country programs and help us think about the pacing of some of these programs and the associated spend? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Yes, sure. There is no doubt that these population sequencing initiatives are really exciting both for the market and for Illumina. These programs, they deepen what we know about the genome, they have the potential to enable precision medicine at a national scale. And perhaps equally importantly, these initiatives, they educate the population about genomics and the value of genomic information in our life. So they are hugely exciting initiatives and it\u2019s fantastic to see the momentum that these are gaining around the world. ","Now having said that, these are large initiatives and they can take years to scale, we brought up GeL, GeL started in late 2014 and it\u2019s really only now that it\u2019s at scale as it\u2019s looking to complete the 100,000 genomes. So hugely exciting for a number of reasons and we\u2019re doing a lot work as you can imagine to support the initiatives, to support the customer tenders, to support the pilots. But it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re counting on as a dramatic revenue driver in 2019.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Go ahead, Jack.","Jack Meehan ","I was hoping you could elaborate on some of the early traction you're seeing with the iSeq launch and just elaborate on what your expectations are in terms of placements, what are some of the customers you're seeing look to adopt the technology? Then finally, your thinking evolved at all around how this could be used as a clinical tool?","Francis deSouza","Yes. Sure. I\u2019m particularly excited about iSeq and the role it plays strategically in our portfolio. When we envisioned iSeq and then we started talking to market about iSeq one of the things we said is that there are tens of thousands of labs, smaller labs that today don\u2019t do any sequencing. And so, we see the opportunity there to use iSeq to bring sequencing to those labs. And we talked about the fact that we expect iSeq customers to fall in three buckets. We said, look, some of the early iSeq customers will be existing Illumina customers. And the used cases they will be drawn to is to use iSeq as a QC tool before they run their libraries on the bigger machine. So if you think about a run on -- NovaSeq for example, that run is tens of thousands of dollars. And so, customers are excited about having iSeq to QC the library before they run it on NovaSeq. I am sure enough as we look at the early orders for iSeq and we look at the pipeline, there are definitely customers that fall into that bucket. They are exciting about having it as a companion to their higher throughput instruments.","The second bucket though we said is, there maybe labs that are familiar with sequencing but don\u2019t have a sequencer because they are outsourcing their sequencing. They are doing that for a couple of reasons. One, they may not have access to the capital necessary to go buy even a MiSeq, but certainly add a NextSeq or a NovaSeq or they just don\u2019t have the regular flow of samples. And so iSeq is a really exciting tool for those customers. And again, if you look at the orders we have got and the pipeline we are building, there is definitely a set of customers that are familiar with sequencing but don\u2019t have a sequencer today.","And then third is probably most exciting, they are going to be the customers that don\u2019t do any sequencing today, that maybe use at the PCR machine or some other tools that iSeq can help address. And again as we look at who is buying iSeq, we are definitely seeing a number of customers that are new to Illumina and in some cases new to sequencing in total. ","When you start to think about the applications that we are hearing from our customers in addition to the companion QC tool, we are hearing customers that are looking to use the iSeq for things like pathogen detection, for microbial whole-genome sequencing and\/or targeted RNA. Those are probably the used cases we hear the most at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Go ahead.","Puneet Souda","I have a broader more longer-term question. I know with Seq consumables, you have obviously seen a great pick up here in consumables and the guide is reflecting that. So I was wondering when you look at it on a multi-year replacement cycle that you have pointed out for NovaSeq, historically for HiSeq we have seen utilization ramp-up and reach a certain level of peak. But in case of NovaSeq, should we assume the utilization and\/or the pull-through to continue to ramp-up longer term, assuming that potential flow cells will come to the table faster than potential new instrument launches?","Francis deSouza","Yes, if I think about it NovaSeq -- and you are right the trend we saw before, the consumables started to build and then hit a peak and then once we hit a steady state we were able to talk to the market about a range that you could use to model pull-throughs. We are still at the stage where the NovaSeq pull-through is continuing to go up. In fact, actually, in the last quarter the pull-through of NovaSeqs hit the new high. And so we are still at the stage where it's building and frankly more than maybe we\u2019d initially expected even. At this stage though it\u2019s still volatile. And so, we are not yet at the stage where we are able to give you a range if you can use in the model. And the scenario you brought up is sort of a realistic scenario which is customers are using multiple flow cells and they are mixing and matching the flow cells that they are using for the applications they want to run. And NovaSeq is a more versatile tool than something like a HiSeq X, which is clearly a whole-genome machine. And so, I think that creates more utilization opportunities for customers than a HiSeq X. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. You can go ahead with your question.","Amanda Murphy ","Sorry for the follow-up on the population sequencing commentary that you\u2019ve made. Just seems like some of these projects -- obviously there\u2019s been an increase in countries and other entities coming online. It seems like there\u2019s some conversation around the rate methodology I guess between genotyping and sequencing. And I guess I\u2019m specifically thinking about all of those where they discussed price point and what they might do over the long-term. My question is, do you have -- obviously you\u2019re having conversations with the customer base in that vein, do you have the kind of the current instrumentation perhaps format that you need to sort to get these guys over the humps in terms of doing broader whole-genome sequencing, meaning the S4 and et cetera or is there an evolution that we should expect before some of them turn to big whole-genome type project?","Francis deSouza","Sure, Amanda. So I will start by saying, there are now dozens of pop seq opportunities that we are working with around the world and they are all a little bit different, something that draws some common trends across some pretty different opportunities in terms of size and scale. I will start by saying that one common thread across the majority of them now is that they are connected to a healthcare system directly even more so than when saw when GeL pioneered population sequencing in 2014. And so, a vast majority of those opportunities now are either directly connected to the healthcare system or actually driven by the healthcare system. ","The other trend we\u2019re seeing is that the majority of them are around whole-genomes. All of it started as sort of thinking about a two stepper where they would start with genotyping and then in a future stage they would go to sequencing and what\u2019s happened now is they have accelerated their sequencing. And so, now they're talking about doing both simultaneously. So even all of us, while it was initially genotyping and then going to sequencing has really brought the sequencing forward. And I think the overall -- the work that\u2019s happened at GeL has read and helpful for the rest of the world in terms of seeing how to be done and seeing the utility of doing whole-genome sequencing. ","In terms of our platform\u2019s readiness, S4 is absolutely appropriate for the large scale population sequencing efforts that we\u2019re talking about and I think it can carry us for a while. Obviously in the longer term as we think about the scale of how these -- how big these initiatives could be as they\u2019re getting embedded across multiple applications in the healthcare system, you\u2019ll need a bigger boat, but for now S4 is absolutely the right answer.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, Dan.","Dan Leonard ","So I was hoping you could elaborate on your DTC assumptions and the visibility you have there. And specifically, I was surprised on the Q3 comments that you would expect sequential weakening, given the amount of promotional activity on prime day, the adoption of WeGene in the overall earlier stage of penetration in Asia and some of the other demand drivers? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Yes. Sure, Dan I\u2019ll speak to it. We haven't given any expectations for the full year in terms of DTC or microarrays, so we haven\u2019t updated our assumptions there. But the seasonality that we talked about is really not uncommon. We see that seasonality every year where we have a strong Q1 and then to some extent a lesser Q2. Q3 is typically the -- I\u2019d say the weakest quarter of the year for DTC and hence why we have indicated that for microarrays in total it\u2019s going to be a weaker quarter. And then we see potential improvements in Q4. That\u2019s the usual seasonality that we see with microarrays and DTC. And this year, we don\u2019t expect anything different.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve Beuchaw","Really coming back just to the Nova consumables question from a couple of other angles. One is, when we think about Nova consumables and the efficiency that it provides to labs, they treat people more for their money right, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. And so, I wonder is it right to think about the sample volumes really picking up at a pace that\u2019s materially more than the 30 plus percent rates that we are seeing in the revenues. And is that something that you would see in BaseSpace from the operations out there in San Diego? Do you see revenues -- I am sorry, samples actually growing quite a bit faster than revenues? And then I wonder if you could circle back on the same topic to sample access, when I think back to 2014-2015 when we had the interest at X emerging, there was at some point difficulty getting to samples, enough samples to keep them running at capacity. But this time around it seems like the access to samples is going along very, very fast. Is the key there that it\u2019s not just whole-genomes this time or is there some other key to the explosion of access to samples?","Francis deSouza","Yes, what we are hearing from our customers and what we are seeing in the pull-through, what we are seeing in the instrumentation data is that customers are running their NovaSeqs hard and that\u2019s showing up in the utilization numbers that we talked about, that\u2019s showing up in the pull-through numbers and the highs that we are hitting in terms of pull-through on NovaSeqs. And what is playing out falls into a number of buckets. ","One, you are absolutely right. We are seeing larger cohorts being run and where they are being run the second driver we are seeing is there is an appetite for doing a broader sequencing, things like going for exomes instead of panels with the biobank we\u2019re going for genomes instead of exomes is that being playing out. ","And then some of the other drivers of people to purchase NovaSeq include applications in oncology like looking for rare events associated with cell-free tumor DNA in the blood. And for their -- for those applications what NovaSeq allows you to do is it allows you to go very deep. And so those customers for example find NovaSeq very attractive and they run them harder finding they could most other machines. And it\u2019s very useful for them in terms of being able to understand the biology. And so what NovaSeq is doing is it\u2019s fundamentally enabling new paradigms for experiment design there in a way that couldn\u2019t be done without the power of NovaSeq and without access to the economics of NovaSeq. And so, all of those are playing out. And what\u2019s interesting about the NovaSeq dynamic if I compare it with the X dynamic is and I think you wanted a point there which is with the X it was really targeting whole-genomes. And so, that was via application and if you were interested in data application or if you wanted to move from exomes to genome, the X is a terrific machine for you. But with NovaSeq, we enable a much broader set of scenarios. And so, if you want to do exomes where you\u2019re doing panels you wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that, in the X you can do that here. If you want to do a very deep targeted sequencing, again that for me is uniquely for NovaSeq and not for the X. And so, it\u2019s that breath of application that you pointed out that means that our customers can access a much broader set of samples, a much broader set of applications, a much broader set of experiment designs and that helps them to getting access to samples. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Massaro from Canaccord. Can you go ahead with your question, Mark?","Mark Massaro ","Yes, thank you. Francis, can you speak to the inflection in new research studies for instance in single cell sequencing? And then related to your comments about exome sequencing, I know Geisinger indicated plans to offer whole-exome sequencing to their 3 million members. Do you expect that to play out later this year and do you expect other systems to potentially follow suit? ","Francis deSouza","Yes. Absolutely, so as I touched on the last answer, NovaSeq is enabling the fundamentally different types of experiments, much, much larger experiments. I know for example if you talk to the people that are working on the single cell atlas for example, they will talk about the fact that if you want to catalog all the different types of cells in the human body and there are 37 trillion-ish cells in the human body, you need to design experiment that are in the tens of millions of cell, and that\u2019s got to be the design. And they have been talking to us for a while saying that they needed a machine that ended up being something like the NovaSeq they said and you need a machine that\u2019s as powerful as NovaSeq with the economics of a NovaSeq to even design and run that experiment. And so, we\u2019re enabling, whether it\u2019s much bigger cohorts like the single cell atlas will have access to or much deeper sequencing, these are experiments that can now be designed and run in a way that couldn\u2019t be done without the NovaSeq. So absolutely NovaSeq is driving new experiment or design paradigms that unlock the necessity associated in the market. ","Sam Samad","Geisinger.","Francis deSouza","And then in terms of what we\u2019re seeing from the health systems, I think Geisinger is definitely a pioneer in terms of going first, but I fully expect over time your genomic record to be a fundamental part of your overall health record. And so it will take time to go from where we are to get there but Geisinger is not going to be the only one I believe that starts to do that in the coming quarters. ","In terms of the base at which I played out, and frankly I think we won\u2019t stop at the exome, I think it will be the whole-genome, that\u2019s part of your health record but that will take time to play out and that will take pioneers like Geisinger and the other ones that are thinking about doing that to lead the way.","Operator","And our next question comes from Catherine Schulte from Baird. Go ahead Catherine.","Catherine Schulte ","We\u2019ve seen varying levels of year end budget clashes over the last few years. But Sam can you just walk us through what kind of assumptions do you have in guidance at this point for fourth quarter research spending patterns? And then Francis, any other commentary you\u2019re hearing from research customers around the current funding environment? ","Sam Samad","Yes. So we're basically expecting what we usually expect around our research spending pattern. There\u2019s nothing that's really different from the prior trends that we're seeing. So in other words without getting into too many details around guidance and what's built into that, nothing really unusual in terms of budget reduction or anything that impacts our research portion of our revenues. Our research actually has been showing strong growth for us, the research component of our revenues, clinical has been showing growth for us as well and we expect that to continue. So nothing built in around any unusual budget crunch at the end of the year.","Francis deSouza","And in terms of the overall research funding environments, if we look around the globe, the research funding environment has never been frankly this good. If you look at what's happened with the NIH budgets here in the US, if you look at the question about how [great] this will play out but if you look at the funding playing out both in the UK and Europe and if you look at what's happening in terms of overall research funding in China, you add it all up to a more robust research funding environment. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin","Just you're now staying with 1.2 billion in net cash, I'm just curious as to -- can you talk about sort of like thinking about capital deployment and obviously you bought Edico, I'm just wondering just put in a broader context I mean your cash flow generation is remarkable at this point.","Sam Samad","Yes. Thanks, Derik. I'll speak briefly to it. So anything that lowers the barrier for the adoption of genomics is one of the key I would say foundational elements of our capital deployment strategy. So if it's technology that we can buy rather than build that helps our customers with the end-to-end workflow around sequencing that lowers the barriers to the adoption of genomics, that's really going to be critical to us and very fundamental in terms of how we deploy capital towards M&A. So that's I would say one key component of capital deployment. We're going to look for potential technologies that make sense to buy rather than build for many reasons. Edico was a great example of that, as you saw. And then the other drivers of capital deployment or the other I would say priorities offsetting equity dilution as we\u2019ve talked about time and time again, we continue to look at potential share repurchases opportunistically to offset equity dilution. And then keep in mind we have two tranches of convertible debt that come due in 2019 and 2021. And so, that should be in the backdrop of your thoughts around also as we think about available cash. ","Operator","And our final question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. ","Bill Quirk","Given the Landmark CMS decision around oncology, NGS oncology reimbursement earlier this year, we\u2019ve noticed an increase in activity at the clinical level, specifically in hospitals. And Francis, can you speak to the interest within systems and I am thinking specifically around the community level hospitals rather than the academic medical centers? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Sure. We definitely agree that we are seeing sort of continued building of the interest in oncology testing. Definitely there's building interest from the translational perspective, a lot of that tends to happen at the academic cancer centers, the larger cancer centers. But we are starting to see interest from some of the smaller hospitals too. I think at this stage, probably the way that might play out is more of it will be driven by outsourced sequencing and so maybe some of that demand will be showing up first in some of the outsourced labs. But over time and certainly as you look at our NextSeq countdown in the portfolio, we think those would be great instruments to put into community hospitals for -- to run oncology panels for example. And so, we think that, that interest continues to build. It\u2019s still -- the vast majority of that market, however, is still in front of us and we expect for that to show up in the mid and low throughput part of our portfolio.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session.

Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, first quarter revenue was $572 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year period and lower than the guidance we provided in January.","Our analysis subsequent to the pre-announcement has identified two key contributors to the shortfall: orders we booked that were not recognizable as revenue; and instrument orders that we were expecting, but did not receive. Additionally, after quarter-end, we received a disappointing outlook from Europe, which is central to the guidance reduction for the remainder of the year. I will address the Q1 factors, and Francis will address our outlook and action plan.","The majority of the shortfall in Q1 resulted from orders booked that did not translate to revenue. A combination of factors contributed, including capacity constraints in array manufacturing resulting in back orders; orders that were received late in the quarter, resulting in systems in transit and therefore not converted to revenue; customer initiated requests for delayed shipment or conditions outside our control delayed revenue recognition; and partial revenue deferrals due to increase in complexity of large deal structures, particularly in the case of high-throughput instruments, including the HiSeq X.","Some of these deferrals will be recognized in Q2, while others will convert to revenue over the rest of the year. Some were controllable by us and some were not, but none are related to fundamental market demand. Individually, each was less than 1% of revenue, and that happens to a degree every quarter, but the combined effect was larger than we expected.","The second factor was HiSeq orders that were forecasted but were not received, accounting for $9 million of the shortfall. As a consequence, we shipped 19 fewer HiSeq 2500, HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq 4000 instruments than anticipated, valued at $14 million, which was partially offset by strength in other portions of the portfolio. We had anticipated sequential growth of 11 units rather than a decline of eight units, which led to flat placements year-over-year.","Over the last several weeks, we've gone through a detailed analysis of the underlying drivers deal by deal. There were no dominant themes, but we did see a collection of factors, including delays in funding release, customers opting to purchase NextSeqs, and one-off situation such as pending lab moves, financing deliberations, contract reviews, or an upcoming regulatory audit. While outsourcing to service providers was also cited by a few customers, this is not a significant driver of our forward projection.","This feedback confirmed our view on questions of competition and market capacity. While we can never be certain a few customers did not delay purchases to assess other platforms, our win rates remained stable; and to our knowledge, we did not lose a competitive deal in Q1. We also did not get any information to indicate that excess market capacity was a factor.","As you can see in our investor deck, high-throughput utilization as a percentage of available sequencing capacity has been on an upward trend since Q3 2014 when normalized for one large order that we shipped in Q3 2015. Run data collected from BaseSpace, which represents about a third of the high-throughput installed base, confirms this analysis, showing roughly flat utilization for legacy HiSeq instruments like HiSeq X, HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq 4000.","Newly announced initiatives, like the Chinese precision medicine program to sequence millions of genomes and the AstraZeneca project to access 2 million genomes, create the confidence that today's sequencing capacity represents but a small fraction of that necessary to meet the growing demand for population sequencing programs.","Focusing now on products. Orders for HiSeq X exceeded our expectations and we added four new customers, bringing the total to 31. Our outlook remains robust, at 20 to 30 instrument orders per quarter. HiSeq X Consumables also beat our forecast despite the timing of customer shipments lowering pull-through to below the guidance range. On a four quarter basis, which normalizes the impact of shipment timing, X utilization averaged $650,000 to $750,000 annually, a range we feel comfortable with going forward.","HiSeq pull-through is in our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000. For modeling purposes, we've removed 95 HiSeqs from our installed base, bringing the figure to just over 2,000 instruments, reflecting the units taken offline due to adoption of newer machines.","Our benchtop instrument portfolio performed well in the quarter, and the outlook is consistent with our expectations coming into the year. This is being driven by lower than expected cannibalization of MiSeq, strong initial interest in MiniSeq and NextSeq adoption for NIPT in China.","Benchtop consumables were strong in Q1, as both MiSeq and NextSeq saw utilization above their respective guidance ranges. Microarrays were also an emerging bright spot this quarter, as revenue grew 1% versus the prior year period to almost $90 million and orders dramatically exceeded our expectations with growth of 85%. A new Consortium Array, which will begin shipping in Q4, and demand from DTC customers, contributed to the strong order result.","Shipments to our clinical customers grew approximately 20% in the quarter. As we've noted on multiple earnings calls, we've been expecting some NIPT services customers to shift to running samples in-house on our sequencers, and a significant part of that shift occurred this quarter. Normalizing for the effect of the lower revenue, because we're not getting the full service revenue, our remaining clinical customer base revenue grew 24%. NIPT shipments grew 10%, or 28% after adjusting for the shift, versus the prior year.","We now believe most payers will next assess average risk coverage decisions in 2017, which is later than we had anticipated. Despite this, the rate of adoption is meeting our forecast, and we expect further acceleration as reimbursement decisions are made. We believe the delay is a matter of focus by the labs that are working to obtain a network designation for existing coverages, as opposed to driving incremental average risk coverage for a faster return on investment.","Oncology shipments grew 9% adjusted for the large HiSeq X shipments seen in the first quarter of last year. This growth rate is lower than that we typically see from this market, due to a large number of orders shipped in the prior year period. We continue to expect expanded adoption in 2016, which will be fueled in part by the launch of TruSight Tumor 170 later this year.","In summary, while we're not happy with our performance in Q1, we do not believe our results are related to a change in fundamental market demand. Instead, timing of instrument orders is creating late quarter revenue uncertainty, some of which we can and will take specific actions to mitigate, and unique customer situations impacting the HiSeq order rate. With the lower European forecast, it was important that we realign our full-year expectations. We continue to believe that demand for next-generation sequencing is far more robust than our first quarter results or the outlook our European forecast suggests.","I'll now turn the call over to Francis.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Thanks, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. Today, I plan to provide further details on our outlook and action plan. Europe revenue declined 2% year-over-year in Q1, missing our projections, and we are forecasting low-to-mid single-digit growth for the full-year. Revenue from the Americas grew 14% representing a slightly slower start than we anticipated for the reasons Jay outlined, but we remain confident in the region's full-year projection of mid-teens growth. Asia Pacific revenue declined 5% as forecasted due primarily to a large HiSeq X comparable.","During the quarter, we began to see customer purchasing patterns in Japan improved as research funds are now being released. It's too early to call this a resurgence, but the signs are certainly more positive.","Our Asia Pacific region is also forecasting mid-teens growth for the year. The Q1 challenges are responsible for a minimal change in full-year outlook. With the benefit of two additional weeks of analysis since our pre-announcement, we are more confident that Q1 was a result of operational challenges and not market demand. By far, the largest driver of our lowered guidance is our lack of visibility in Europe, as evidenced by the drop in the region's full-year forecast three months after we completed our budget. We're taking steps to enhance visibility and improve our execution in the region.","In the meantime, we have incorporated the reduced outlook from Europe into our projection. We're focusing on three areas to deliver on our full-year. First, we're making improvements to our sales process. To address the variability in instrument orders and shipments during the last months of the quarter, we're focusing the sales team on early closure of instrument orders.","In addition, large instrument contracts including those for HiSeq X have become more complex, particularly in Europe. And so we are simplifying and standardizing deals. Finally, we're building out our manufacturing capacity for arrays, so that we're able to clear the back orders, and meet the increasing demand.","Second, we are committed to improving the execution and outlook in Europe. As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we recently brought in an interim sales leader in Europe, who has already established accountability and ownership for the revised forecast and is driving to the updated expectations. He has already put in place greater discipline around opportunity management, accuracy of our CRM data and quoting. In addition, we're making good progress in our search for a permanent general manager with large global company experience to ensure that our European organization realizes its full potential.","The last step in our plan is focused on expense management. Last year we added close to 900 employees, 500,000 square feet of real estate commitments and a new global ERP system. While these investments were necessary to support both the growth we have experienced and our ongoing market opportunities, we recognize the need to meaningfully slow down the pace of investment in 2016, given our updated outlook.","We do not expect to have broad changes to our product portfolio or development pipeline but do have other opportunities to delay initiatives that are less impactful to the long-term outlook. We're working on a 2016 re-plan, and have incorporated those improvements into our guidance for the remainder of the year. As a result excluding GRAIL and Helix, our operating margin target for the year is expected to be 34.5%. While disappointing our Q1 results have not dampened our conviction and our market opportunity or our ability to deliver innovative technology to capture those markets.","I am personally committed and excited to move this organization to realize our mission, benefit patients and deliver shareholder value.","I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our first quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Thanks, Francis. While revenue for the quarter missed our guidance, orders of over $700 million significantly beat our expectations. We built more than 100 million in sequencing consumable backlog, most of which is expected to be delivered this year.","As a reminder, we typically see higher sequencing consumable orders in the first quarter, ahead of annual list price increases. Instrument revenue declined 20% year-over-year to $118 million, given the large HiSeq X shipments in the first quarter last year, which accounts for more than $30 million of decline.","Consumable revenue was of $361 million, an increase of 17% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% over Q1 of last year to approximately $300 million. Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 12% versus Q1 2015 to $89 million. This improvement was driven by extended maintenance contracts associated with the largest sequencing installed base and genotyping services, partially offset by a decline in NIPT service revenue, given the shift to in-house testing as expected.","Going forward, we expect (14:29) to at least partially offset the further impact from the transition of these two customers. Turning now to gross margin, operating expenses, I will highlight on our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, both of which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders.","Our adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 71.7%, flat compared to the fourth quarter as the benefit of favorable consumables mix was offset by lower absorption. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins contracted 50 basis points as the positive impact of consumables mix was more than offset by lower instrument margin associated with fewer HiSeq X shipments as well as the decline in services margin.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $113 million or 19.8% of revenue, including $5 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $103 million or 17.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter, higher due to head count additions and investments in GRAIL, Helix, and development projects including projects including Project Firefly. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $125 million, or 21.9% of revenue, including $3 million attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $124 million, or 20.9% of revenue, in Q4.","Adjusted operating margins were 30.1% compared to 33.4% in the fourth quarter and 39.3% in the prior-year period. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margins were 31.6% in the first quarter. The year-over-year decline is attributable to the lower gross margins and increased employee-related expenses.","Stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, flat compared to Q4. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 25.5%, compared to 24.5% in the first quarter of last year and non-GAAP net income was $106 million. This resulted in Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.71, which included approximately $0.04 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix respectively. This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $135 million and $0.91 in the first quarter of 2015 respectively.","We reported first quarter GAAP net income of $90 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, compared to net income of $137 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, in the prior-year period. As a reminder, prior-period results include a pre-tax gain of $15 million from the partial sale of our minority interest in Sequenta when acquired by Adaptive Biotechnologies.","Cash flow from operations equaled $40 million, lower versus the prior year due to the impact of the operating expense growth. Q1 DSO totaled 64 days, equal to last quarter, and inventory rose to $288 million, given the quarterly shortfall in sequencing instruments, and a continued build-up of consumable safety stock. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $53 million, higher than the $37 million in the prior-year quarter, due primarily to our real estate build-outs.","Consequently Q1 free cash flow was a negative $14 million. During the quarter, we retired the remaining $76 million of the 0.25% 2016 convertible notes and ended the quarter with approximately $1.34 billion in cash and short-term investments including the cash balances of GRAIL and Helix.","Looking forward, we now expect total company revenue growth of 12% year-over-year. Beyond the first quarter miss (18:09), the additional decline versus our original expectation of 16% is due to the lowered outlook for Europe, which went from high-teens growth to low-single digits to mid-single digits, including a smaller contribution than planned from the Genome England (sic) [Genomics England] (18:19) project.","Our outlook in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions is much more robust as both are expected to grow in the mid-teens for the full year, roughly in line with our expectations due in part to strong orders in the first quarter. For these regions in the second half, we expect to see HiSeq sales increase but remain short of our original expectation. We believe this will be more than offset by (18:40) MiSeq placements, given lower than expected cannibalization, as well as an increase in the rate revenue (18:45), NextSeq consumables and HiSeq X placements.","We also continue to expect strong adoption across our four clinical markets in 2016. We are forecasting Q2 revenue of $590 million to $595 million driven by sequential seasonality in Japan and roughly flat HiSeq X shipment. We're not forecasting an uptick in other HiSeq instrument shipments until the second half. This Q2 revenue guidance implies a meaningful back half acceleration.","Our confidence in delivering for this projection stems from our existing backlog, a third of which is shippable in Q3 and Q4, and our pipeline. We are projecting Q2 non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74 as higher revenue is expected to be largely offset by a sequential increase in operating expenses both from the head count additions in the first quarter and additional GRAIL and Helix spend. The steps we are taking to reduce spending will have a marginal impact in Q2 and a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.","We anticipate significant EPS leverage in the second half, driven by the acceleration of the revenue growth and our spending action. For the full year, non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.35 to $3.45, which includes GRAIL dilution of $0.20, an increase of $0.05 versus our prior estimate. Illumina is retaining almost all of the GRAIL losses in net income attributable to Illumina shareholders, significantly greater than our majority ownership percentage, due to an unexpected accounting treatment.","We are in discussions with GRAIL regarding updating the equity structure. Our updated non-GAAP EPS guidance and GRAIL dilution commentary includes our expectation that we will continue to recognize most of the losses in the second quarter and that drops substantially in the second half to closer to our ownership, based on the structural changes that are being contemplated in Q2 and the accounting treatment we are anticipating. Any delays in this timeline could have a negative impact of up to $0.04 per quarter in the second half.","In closing, as a management team, we have a number of matters to address that we have outlined today, including our in quarter linearity, our execution in Europe, and rate of investment and GRAIL equity structure. Resetting our outlook so significantly is uncharacteristic of our company and unacceptable to us as a team. We are committed to delivering strong results consistent with our track record and our confidence in the long-term opportunity for our business remains high.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we will now open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. Sorry to hone in on the Europe issues, but I just would love to hear from you a little bit more about the steps you're taking to improve your forecasting ability. Obviously, you had issues in Europe in 3Q last year as well. So if you could just talk a little bit about how you intend to improve visibility there? And really what gives you the confidence that the problems are going to be fixed by 3Q since the back half estimates are essentially unchanged to get to the midpoint of the new guidance range.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Sure, Tycho. This is Francis. There are a number of things we are doing. We started by moving one of our strong leaders from the U.S., who ran Western region, Scott Thomas out to Europe. And he was out there at the beginning of this quarter and has already started rolling out a much more disciplined sales process. And that starts all the way from capturing the opportunities and tracking the opportunities as well as managing our visibility into the opportunities that are in various stages of the process.","He is also instituted, a process that frankly we use in the U.S., around managing the pipeline for some of our lower-end instruments. And so that alone has started to give us better visibility into when deals are expected to close over the course of this quarter and allowed us to add urgency and also manage more for a weekly close process, rather than a close process that's so heavily tailored towards the end of the quarter. That does a few things; one, it gives us much better visibility into what we're working for the course of the quarter, it helps drive urgency into the team, and it helps make sure that we understand whether we have the pipe to get the deals we need.","Additionally, Tycho, the execution challenges that we've talked about in Europe, much of that related to this deferral challenge that I talked about in the script, where we had a surprisingly large amount of revenue that was not recognizable, and part of the discipline we need in the team is to pull in the orders to make sure that we don't have a lot of systems that don't get shipped in time to be recognized as revenue, or there are small contractual issues at the end of the quarter that wind up having a revenue recognition question and therefore can't be counted. And that's all the discipline of making sure that those deals get closed earlier in the quarter, and Scott is going to make a big difference there as well, we believe.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Tycho, I would just add one point to your question about confidence in the outlook for the rest of the year. As I mentioned in the script, or Francis mentioned, we've got Europe in our outlook currently at the revised number that they've committed to and provided recently, which is a lot lower than it was previously. And so that gives us an opportunity to get these changes and improvements baked in, and start to get some positive impacts from them.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the other side, on spending, I know you talked about maybe pulling back on some of the hiring. Can you just get us comfortable that \u2013 I mean, you're such an innovation-driven company that you're not necessarily going to be kind of pushing off stuff that could impact the pipeline and really, future growth.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I mean, that's an important tradeoff for us to analyze, and we're in the process of doing that right now. And, of course, the most important programs that are the largest revenue generators, the ones with the highest ROI, will continue to be fully staffed and fully funded. What we'll be looking for are other areas outside of the core product development activity. For example, we may re-staff some of our research at a bit slower rate, because we moved a lot of those people over into GRAIL, and much of that research work has an effect three years to five years from now. So those are the kinds of things we can slow down for some short number of quarters until we get back to the revenue growth rates that we believe we should be at. And clearly, we're going to do that in some of the other support organizations as well, without impacting customer support and the core product development activity. So we're pretty confident we can make a big impact without hitting the core.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Yeah. Another example of something we're doing there, Tycho, is look, we've already kicked off an initiative to drive more focus and prioritization. And one of the things that we'd identified was that look, there's this terrific strategic planning process that kicks off the project that we want to focus on for the future and leads to the new products we put out.","One element that we hadn't focused on historically is to look at all the initiatives we have underway and see what we could stop doing. So we had already kicked off an effort to look at all the things we had going on and prune that portfolio, if you like. So that's an effort we already had underway. We're accelerating that to sort of complete over the course of this quarter, and expect to roll that out starting over the next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Co. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. I guess, first, just a \u2013 I guess a couple quick ones, and then maybe a slightly longer answer question after that. So the first one is, maybe as a follow-up to Tycho, regarding your guidance for the year, some seem to be focused on what seems to be some back-end loading of the guidance.","Does your guidance reflect an assumption that demand gets better, or execution gets a lot better in the second half? Or is your guidance simply reflecting that comparisons get a lot more favorable in the second half, keeping in mind first half growth last year was around 30% and second half growth was 17%? It doesn't seem like you're baking in a whole lot more for the second half than the first half. It seems like it's more comps driven. Is that fair?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Doug. Yes, can you hear me? It's Marc.","Operator","We're back guys. Sorry, we lost the call there for a minute.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Doug, I lost you about two-thirds the way through your question, I think.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. It's really just your guidance for the year and the pacing doesn't seem to reflect a whole lot in the way of herculean assumptions for an improvement in the second half in terms of demand or execution. It seems on the surface to be more a function of just changes in year-over-year comparisons, first half to second half, is that fair?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, there's a couple of elements, comparisons are better or easier in the back half, for sure. We're not anticipating any radical changes in the European outlook, because we've actually factored in the disappointing European outlook into the guidance numbers that we've given, and obviously we'll be working to do better than those numbers and are working hard to achieve that. But the single biggest factor that gives us a lot of confidence in the back half is the backlog, the strength of the backlog, the incoming order rate that we had in Q1 and the pipeline that we see for business in the Americas and Asia-Pacific in the back half. So that's what really gives us confidence in the increasing revenue rates in the back half of the year.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Yeah. I'd say very strongly that the numbers we've put out for the rest of the year were driven from a bottoms-up look at what the regions were forecasting, based on what they had in the pipeline and had visibility into. And so that's what gives us the confidence.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Another area of focus has been clinical growth, you grew 20% in the quarter, oncology growth was 9%. These on the surface jump out as being light. That being said, what you didn't point out was that clinical growth was up against a tough compare. I think you grew 60% in Q1 of last year, the oncology comp I think is 37% growth. Can you just share any data on backlog, or really anything else, that will help address concerns about a moderation in clinical demand?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, as we tried to indicate in the script, we didn't see any fundamental demand factors in our business. We did very deep analysis, as you might imagine, over the last few weeks and so that did not pop out from anywhere. The clinical comparisons were very difficult against Q1 last year for sure, as you pointed out. And so I think that's the single biggest driver in the numbers that we saw in Q1. So we continue to feel very positive about the clinical adoption rates going through the year, and a lot of the key inflections in our markets, whether it's average risk (29:54) coverage, whether it's oncology reimbursement, those affect us largely in the clinical markets over the next year.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And one last one. Q1 was not your best quarter, and it's been a tough two out of three. That said, you made it really clear in your prepared remarks that nothing occurred in the quarter that heightened concern about overcapacity, competitive dynamics, the clinical outlook or market potential, but one of the big debates in the investment community is about Illumina's long-term growth outlook. Given some recent developments, and clearly the moderation in revenue growth over the last few quarters, we didn't hear anything in your remarks that would suggest there is a change in how you think about the market opportunity or your ability to drive growth via innovation. Could you just help us with some commentary in terms of how you're thinking about things on the longer-term growth potential, and why we shouldn't think differently about Illumina, given what we've seen over the last few quarters?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Hey, if anything (30:58) I'd say that there is nothing that happened in Q1, despite our disappointment, your disappointment, and obviously our investors' disappointment in our actual performance there, that caused us to change our thinking or our conviction in any way about the sequencing opportunity, the market position we have, the competitive prospect, or the future growth and (31:21) of our business. So there are no fundamental changes there, we clearly didn't think it was appropriate to emphasize those points in the script, on the back of a disappointing quarter for all of us.","So we didn't highlight that, but I can assure you that there is \u2013 this is something we consider to be a short-term issue with us and we're going to come through it. And there is no fundamental changes in our outlook to the market or our pace of innovation over the next couple of years.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now, open.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good afternoon.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, just one short question which is stock option expense for the full year and then a longer question which is sort of following up on Doug's question I think, we've had a lot of incomings from investors questioning the outlook and just the numbers. But I think, in particular, we had a lot of questions on GRAIL and Helix and the fact that those are dilutive to earnings right now and when they would start to potentially be more accretive, I guess.","The question been is like when are potentially we going to see some return on those investments and it's more of a question about valuation support for the stock, relative to some of the other names in the MedTech space, that are trading at similar types of top-line growth levels right now. So basically give us some clarity or some indication when do you think you're going to see some benefits from \u2013 be able to get some benefits from Helix and GRAIL?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What was the stock comp question exactly?","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","What is the update for the full year, is there \u2013 what's the number for the full year.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Marc, do you want to cover...","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah. Derik, let me talk to that one really quickly. I'm not giving that specific number at this point, but we're on a path here that isn't going to accelerate that substantially through the second half. There are going to be some upticks, part of which is related to Helix and GRAIL and part of which is related to core Illumina. But it's not going to be that vastly different from what you've seen so far.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","With respect to GRAIL and Helix, Derik, those are incredibly important, strategic bets for our company. We think they both represents, on their own, massive markets, as we've talked, about in cancer screening, gigantic opportunity, probably the single biggest market segment that we can imagine. We continue to believe that there is going to be a strong market for consumer genomics, but it's going to take some work to create the ecosystem to really unleash that, and that's the goal of Helix.","And as a company, it is critically important that we take a long-term view and that $0.05 a share in a quarter, even $0.10 a share in a quarter, compared to the opportunities that these two ventures portend for us in the next five years, is insignificant.","And so, we're not prepared today to talk about when these are going to turn profitable, and begin to contribute to the bottom-line, but GRAIL, as we mentioned, is a long-term bet and they're not going to be seeing product on the market for some time. Helix will be quicker and so once we get into 2017, we'll begin to get the earliest indications of revenue ramp, but I certainly wouldn't expect that to be a profitable enterprises in 2017.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hi, good afternoon, guys.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Jay or Francis, just to go back to Europe, as you've digested the issue a little bit, have you found that the shortfall on the HiSeq side was due more to installs that didn't materialize on the clinical or on the non-clinical side of things? And then if I could just ask a follow-up for Marc. Marc, what are you forecasting instrument revenues to be down year-over-year at this point? Thank you.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. There was nothing in the European numbers that was market specific. And so these were revenue recognition issues of various sorts as I highlighted in the script. None of those were particularly related to specific markets within the clinical sector or the research sector.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Right, they are two very different issues, right. If we look at Q1 HiSeq story and that was the HiSeq story across regions and we talked about the fact that a lot of that was the HiSeq shortfall (35:47) in the orders that came in that we weren't able to recognize as revenue. So that's really what the Q1 story was.","Looking forward the issue is around the forecasted shortfall in Europe and there we believe a lot of it is around sales execution. And that's really what we are focused on, driving more discipline and generating the pipeline, getting visibility into the pipeline and urgency in working the deals through the process and that's across instruments and across markets in Europe.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, Francis, if I could just sort of crystallize from both your thoughts on the issue itself in Europe, is it your estimation that what took place in Europe was pretty much 100% personnel-related?","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","I think personnel and then the knock-on effect on the process we're running in Europe. I feel like, we have \u2013 and you're not going to put all this on one person and we have definitely good people on the team. What we are seeing is that we don't run as disciplined a process in Europe as we do in the other regions, and already we're starting to see in the last few weeks an improvement in the visibility of the pipeline through this quarter and we're seeing more urgency in our sales process. So that we believe were the biggest drivers in what we're seeing in Europe.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","And Dan, on the instrument revenue, yeah, we are not bifurcating the guide for the year into the individual component pieces, but I gave some specific commentary, I mean clearly we've given commentary around Q1. I gave some specific commentary around Q2 there as well. So definitely a slower start for the year, driven by the high throughput and then as I mentioned we're seeing uptick towards the second half of the year, but not giving out specific commentary on breaking down the revenue growth by category at this point.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a million. So, (37:57) just correct me if I'm wrong, Jay or Francis, but it feels a little bit it was like, two misses out of three quarters, that maybe you \u2013 just given the size of the company, you have a pretty segmented market in terms of the products that you're in, it feels to me like there is a transition happening, kind of away from being necessarily your products story and a little bit more a market development story, and I'm just wondering, do you feel like you have a little less control or visibility into your quarterly results and if you need to, but just more broadly, if you're thinking about, how you need to approach forecasting?","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Yeah. I maybe wouldn't characterize it exactly like that, Jon, but I think your points are important ones. I've highlighted over the past year or 18 months that much of the market development that has to happen now in sequencing falls on Illumina, that we don't have a lot of other large companies who are spending marketing dollars developing markets and so that is key for us to do, more than it ever has been. And the big markets we're opening up now have each their own unique set of issues, whether it's reimbursement or regulatory or in the case of GRAIL, clinical trial work. And so it does take some time to open up those new markets. Having said that, there is no question that Illumina is so driven by product innovation and in all of our businesses, we analytically see, a cycle that's related to product cycles and that, whenever we launch new platforms, we get a surge of new orders for those instruments and then the following year, the consumables begin to catch up and then that platform begins to level out over time. So, every platform has an S curve associated with it.","It is true that we are a larger company now and therefore, each individual S curve has a smaller effect on the total revenue of the company. So, there is no getting around that fact and so we've \u2013 we have much greater diversity in our business now, which is a good thing, but each individual product launch probably is less of an impact that it might have been back when we had only one sequencer. For example when we replaced the GA with the HiSeq everybody bought a HiSeq, because it was the only product in the market. That's not quite where we are today.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And as we look to operationalize those dynamics, as I said, there are two dynamics playing out. One is, there is an opportunity for us to get more actively involved in the development of those markets, so we can accelerate the adoption of MGS into the different markets we play in and work with our customers to help them with things like, the trial that we're doing, the STAR trial we're doing in the PGS space, in the IVF world for example.","We're also getting more engaged with our customers in the payer community and market access programs, and part as Jay said, what we do to develop the market is actually bring new instruments into the market which can catalyze the market through the access to a lower price point. So, certainly, a set of things we are going to operationalize, developing those markets.","Separate from that, there is a change in how you sell at this scale. And that, in addition to sort of tracking the big deals that get a high level of visibility at the executive level, a scalable sales process needs to make sure that we're taking care of the flow business and that we do have really good visibility into the pipeline, how pipelines are progressing, the opportunities and that's what we're putting in place in Europe for example right now.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","And that's helpful. And then, just as a quick follow-up, I think you were minus 5% in Asia Pac where you said you're guiding to mid-teens, I know you had a solid book-to-bill, is there anything else that the kind of \u2013 gives you the confidence in that acceleration in Asia Pac for the rest of the year? Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's exactly right. So, we did see, as expected a decline in Asia in Q1, but as we look at the forecast for the rest of the year, we do believe we have the opportunities and pipeline to support a mid-teens growth in the year. The things that are driving those are one, there is activity around the Chinese PMI that is causing purchasing to happen. We saw that already start and we expect that to play out. We're continuing to see incremental improvement in Japan for example. And while that is slow and steady, it's slow and steady in the right direction and we're seeing that show up in our pipeline as well.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","And Jon, obviously Japan was a challenge quarter-after-quarter for us last year and so that's reflected in the (42:39-43:49).","Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury","Operator, we're ready for the next question.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys. So, can you just go back to that capacity utilization slide and sort of help us understand exactly sort of what we're looking at and how we should sort of interpret the peaks and dips in terms of how you relate that or if it's at all relatable to how you think about your instrument forecasts or managing at least sort of that (43:22)?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Marc, you want to walk through that or you want me to or...","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","I just want to, yeah, Ross, guess what, I missed the first part. You were saying in relation to the utilization slide?","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Yeah, I'm just trying to exactly understand how we should interpret sort of the various levels of capacity utilization across the base, and then, how we should think about certain points. Typically, if you think about capacity utilization, it sort of signals capital purchasing depending on what level it is. So how do we interpret what levels for you to signal that you should see an increase in instrumentation demand versus maybe a moderation at a certain level and how you sort of attempt to manage it. I'm just trying to exactly interpret what we are supposed to gain from those.","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah. So I think a couple of things. Firstly, the capacity calculation itself, which is based on the actual mix of types of kit that our customers buy and run. Clearly, that's increasing quarter-over-quarter as a result of both the installed base, a little bit of the change in mix and that's coming up with higher throughput instruments, which I will come back to, when I look at the capacity utilization chart. If you think about the percentages, what you probably \u2013 what you don't want to see is a very low percentage of utilization. That would reflect a lot of spare capacity in the market, which would have a read-through, I think, to future instrument purchases. You're obviously not going to see utilizations based on our trajectory of past history and our trajectory of much over 50% on an ongoing basis due to the decentralization of market. Only in a centralized market would you see it much, much higher than this.","So, if you look at the data, what you're seeing is \u2013 well, you see a couple of inflection points where the utilization tends to stabilize. That happens to coincide, in fact in one case, go down, if you look at 3Q 2014, that coincides with when we put new capacity in the market, so back then was the v4 run kit and that created an instant increase in available capacity, which caused the dip in utilization, you can see that recovered. Same thing as, when we introduced the HiSeq 4000, that had an effect on the growth and utilization because we introduced new capacity into the market, with that instrument as well.","And then what you're seeing if you see it normalize without one large order is they have a fairly consistent growth rate, which is exactly what you would want to see, which I believe \u2013 we believe reflect that the capacity is not \u2013 there is not excess capacity in the market, it's being utilized at a rate that is increasing over time, in spite of the increased volumes or capacities that we're putting out there with the higher throughput instruments and kits, does that safe? (46:11)","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The takeaway of course, from this, Ross, is that, to the concern that there is always extra capacity being generated in the market, I think this analysis and what we've gotten from our base analytics show that that's just not the case. That the average instrumentation utilization, if anything, is on a slightly upward trend, which is exactly what we would hope to see. And expect to see.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Right. And I guess regionally, would Europe look any different, I'm sure you've probably cut the data at some point.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, Europe would be lower on the averages, the trend line probably isn't too much different, but we clearly see highest utilization in the U.S. Europe tends to be significantly lower on average utilization across almost all the platforms.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's helpful. Jay, you started off talking about the various reasons for sort of the HiSeq miss, and you have that nice little pie chart which sort of breaks down the components. I guess, as you stated, typically in a quarter, maybe one or two will happen, but not as many. I mean, as you think about the complexity of your business and what you can sort of manage versus what is just market-oriented and the like \u2013 and I guess, what period in the company's history, or what prior experience in all the years you've been doing this, would you sort harken back to and say oh, this reminds me of X, and because of Y, we feel confident. I'm just trying to figure out it \u2013 what this most looks like, in terms of any of the few sort of periods of challenge that the company has had. I mean, there hasn't been very many.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, and I think from a sort of magnitude of the challenge, Q3 2011 was the other big one for us, driven by very different factors, that was a collection. It was one of those, again, rare quarters where you had the convergence of a whole bunch of factors all at once, which I think we had this quarter as well. The specific factors that were different than the ones we had in Q1, but it was one of those of sort of convergence effects that sometimes happens, and that's what happened to us in Q1. So I'd say that's the closest analogy, in terms of lots of things going in the wrong direction in one quarter.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. So I just had a follow-up to your answer to Jon's question earlier about sort of the R&D pipeline, and I appreciate your comment about enabling markets and smaller S curves but I'm wondering, if you think about technical \u2013 or advancements that could further move the market forward, I was just curious if you can give us some high-level perspective there. So, obviously, you mentioned the innovation at the lower kind of CapEx portion of the market, but is there anything in the works? Obviously, ordered arrays is quite meaningful in terms of the improvement in performance, is there anything like that in the works that you could talk to obviously, with respect to your R&D pipeline (49:21) obviously?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, we can't give you specifics on that of course, but if you think about it, ordered arrays have only been implemented on the very highest end of our product line, HiSeq X and the HiSeq 3,000, HiSeq 4,000. So, we could put ordered arrays on other products in the product line, when and if that becomes important for a throughput and cost reason and is the highest return R&D program for us to invest in. And so, that technology can be applied to the other instruments, we've not done that yet, because we don't think it's the most important factor in increasing the overall revenue from those segments.","But we have a broad product line now, and over time, various portions of that product line will age out and they will be replaced by brand new products that we bring into the market, that of course will have dramatic new innovations built into them. And we've been working on the fundamental technologies around this (50:16) continued improvements in what we did in NextSeq and then how we learned from MiSeq and NextSeq and made a MiniSeq. And many of those kinds of improvements will get bundled into whatever the next system architecture is, and clearly, we're working across the entire product portfolio, and we'll launch products into the segments we think are the richest opportunities therein.","And we think that, none of those segments is, I guess \u2013 I described it as permanently saturated, meaning that people won't change out their boxes if we bring something brand new in, and that can be dramatically different in cost, it could be dramatic improvements in ease of use and usability, dramatic improvements in speed, there is all kinds of vectors that we're working on and prioritizing in our R&D pipelines. And then, instruments aside, we have very exciting stuff going in the sample prep area and the informatics area, and it's a very broad product development portfolio.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Yeah. One thing to highlight is, look, in addition to looking to, over time, refresh everything we've got, one of the other things you can expect is, look, we are keenly focused on addressing the biggest impediments to getting NGS adopted in the different segments. Some of that is through our own offerings and you can expect innovations where customers are telling both you and us that there are the biggest bottlenecks. So for example, one of the things we heard early on when we launched the X was that, the informatics around was a problem and a challenge for our customers, and you saw us launch C cloud (51:45). So you can expect that, across the different segments, the biggest impediment is that customers are telling you about, they're telling us too, and through a combination of our own innovations and partner innovations, you should expect us to be looking to address those.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Super helpful. And then, just I guess a more specific question on one of the reasons that you cited around the HiSeq miss was related to people evaluating the NextSeq. So I was curious, I know that's not that many of them, but was that an NIPT-driven factor, and so, if so, then how should we think about product mix maybe changing, to the extent that average risk gains more traction next year?","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Well, there was an underlying factor where one or a couple perhaps of our NXP (52:36) customers are converting to NextSeqs, but that was something we were aware of. And so that was in the plan, we knew that going in (52:40) forecast. We did exactly what we thought we were going to do in those examples. The ones that we cited and referred to in the script and in the table were ones that essentially stalled the HiSeq quarter we expected to get at the very last minute, where we thought that those orders were coming in, and they didn't come in because the customer was considering that and we didn't know about it. That's the execution issue.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. This is actually Alex Nowak filling in for Bill today. So going back to the first quarter, just trying to understand what happened following the preannouncement that changed the commentary from saying that the Q1 shortfall is predominantly due to customer outsourcing to now being a myriad of different issues that you really had no control over. Just trying to understand, what was the change there?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So if you go back and look at the exact script, we didn't say primarily outsourcing, we did cite the example of outsourcing as one factor that we knew about at the preannouncement date. You can imagine, in those two weeks before the preannouncement, we were scrambling hard to try to get as much data together as we could and have a preannouncement that was timely. We didn't want to wait another week to do a preannouncement to have more data, and so we've learned a lot in the last two weeks when all of the analytics from the Q1 have really come in and we've been able to digest them, talk to the regions, get the new forecast, understand all of the background detail. And so we've been able to go order by order and look at every one of the circumstances and break it into the pie chart that you see in the deck that we provided. And so there were a lot of different issues, and no singular thing to (54:28) dominate. And so I think what happened is because we mentioned that one comment, people jumped on that one thing we mentioned as the cause, and it clearly wasn't and we didn't intend to imply that it was. So we probably should have said among many causes this was one we knew about at that time.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Yeah. Lead (54:44) factor was a shortfall in HiSeq, that's the (54:48).","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just switching to a little bit longer term...","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","In addition to getting the orders that didn't convert into revenue, so those were the two issues that we talked about in the preannounce, and those are the two issues still.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the China Precision Medicine Program, just a two part question, sounds like you're starting to see the program move in the country. I'm just wondering if you could provide some more color on what you're seeing, what you're hearing from customers. And then the second part of the question is, is there any risk that several customers in China are buying instruments, specifically, HiSeq Xs in anticipation for sequencing volume, and just because of the timing of a program ramp, you could have some idle (55:32) instruments sitting throughout China?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we are seeing a number of customers gearing up to try to be participants in the PMI, we don't know who will win that ultimately, and I don't think they do either frankly. There's obviously a couple of some very strong candidates to participate, and those are large entities, some of which own instruments already, some of which don't. So we think they will buy in advance to have some installation, and perhaps the pull through will be a little bit lower on those in early stages, but they should get very highly utilized once the program begins to ramp up. So sure, we could have a little bit lower utilization locally on some instruments, but that's not atypical, I mean, people sometimes do that for other programs as well, and we'll take that into account in our forecast and our planning.","Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Your line is now open.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you. This overlaps a little bit with the last question, but Jay or Francis, I was hoping you could characterize the incremental X customers, I think you grew to 31 in the quarter. And then also the funnel, in terms of are these (56:46) customers that have samples, have projects or are they buying Xs in anticipation of some missionary sales, some different kind of business model?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. So one of the things we talked about is, we did have the four Xs that came in in Q1. We did see some interest from the \u2013 wanting to participate in the Chinese PMI that is driving some of the X interest. We haven't gone public with the customers that have come online in Q1. So I can say that there is definitely demand generated from the Chinese PMI, but we can't talk about specific customers associated with that.","Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury","Yeah. The only one that's public is GENEWIZ.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Well, I know, at least early in the HiSeq X program, you were careful to deliver instruments to folks that had samples and had projects. Is that still the case or are you more (57:42) shipping orders as they come?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, that's still a factor. We still use the access to samples as a criteria for the purchase. And what we've really seen in probably the past year is more of the X customers are metering out their instrument deliveries, we're in the very early phases of X, people converting their entire large existing programs over to the X, if you're abroad or an NHI (58:10). What we see now is, someone will place an X order and say, okay, I want two units for now and then a quarter or two quarters from now, I'll take another three and so we're not \u2013 that's one way that we deal with sample access problem and they do as well.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of clarifications. Marc, I wonder given the $700 million order figure that you provided, if you could give us just a little bit more context around it. Could you give us any sense for maybe what the backlog growth was exiting Q1 or maybe how the growth in orders compares to what you saw in 2015, just so we can again put it in a little bit more context? And then Jay, I wanted to follow up on a couple of comments you made in the prepared remarks around clinical. First on NIPT, I was a little surprised given that we're here in May of 2016, that you talked about some reimbursement decisions around NIPT getting delayed out to 2017, maybe I'm just overly optimistic there, but I wondered if there might be some hope for the second half of 2016, curious what is it that you're seeing there. And then, just to round it out on clinical, on the clinical cancer side, I just want to make sure I understand the narrative, is it stable reimbursement, new products, drives (59:32) reacceleration, is that the way to think about it. Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Marc do you want to start?","Marc A. Stapley - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Administrative Officer","Yeah. So I'll start with the orders conservation. Steve, obviously a large part of the orders that we booked in the first quarter were shipped in the first quarter, as you would normally expect. But we built significant backlog, and I quote out specifically sequencing consumable backlog, and that will ship mostly through this year, in fact, almost entirely, there is some that carries over into 2017 and beyond. But most of that is going to ship this year. So the way I would think about that, is it's kind of an advanced ordering of reagent purchases that we're going to get, or we should get anyway throughout the year. So it gives us some confidence, but I wouldn't think of it as necessarily incremental. It is relative to last year and prior year, it is larger than we've traditionally seen. And so it gives us a little bit more of the backlog than we would normally have at this time.","And then, I also mentioned that we have about a third of our ending backlog for the quarter, rolling over into the second half which gives us some added confidence. Obviously, that includes a portion of those sequencing consumables that I just talked about. So it's nothing more kind of quantitative than that at this point. But other than the sequencing consumables, I would say pretty pleased with the array business and the consumer driven activity there, which has been another helpful part of building backlog. What it wasn't necessarily was a significant proportion of instrument backlog that's not, it's become much more of a \u2013 instruments have become much more of a turn in the quarter type of activity. We don't necessarily come into the quarter with significant levels of backlog like you saw us have in Q1 of 2015, and it's much more normalized now.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I would just add the math on the backlog growth is pretty simple. So it's $700 million plus minus the revenue that we get in. So that growth in the backlog was more than we've typically seen in Q1. So we felt really good about the incoming order rate. With respect to NIPT, what we're seeing is that the large payers, the majors there tend to assess coverage decisions on specific dates. So they are on a cycle, and so if they're not on a cycle to do this in 2016, there is little to no chance they are going to go off cycle to approve this. And so as we've mapped out all those cycles, there still remains a possibility of some of them late in 2016, but the majority of them fall in 2017, which is why we cited that we think that the bolus of these coverage decisions will be made in 2017.","With respect to cancer, the narrative really isn't about stable reimbursement, because the vast majority of the cancer tests aren't reimbursed today, even foundation medicine. So most of that market is being driven by labs running these tests for market share reasons. Most of the labs are losing money on the cancer tests. So the reimbursement opportunity in oncology lies ahead of us, and it's something that many of our customers are working on. It's an area that I'll be spending a fair amount of my time on in the next year, and it's related to the standardization challenges that I think exist here. We're in the phase of the oncology market where it's becoming increasingly fragmented with lots and lots of different panel products, and one of the things that Illumina needs to do is to begin to re-converge that market into a more standard set of products and more standard set of processes so that payers can get their heads around, what is a \u2013 something they should be paying for, and that's something our TST 15 is attempting to do initially in (01:03:30). Our TST 170 will begin to move in that direction as well, but remember those are REO (01:03:35) products as we can't sell those for clinical use. And so we are evaluating what's happening with the FDA before we begin to push those toward regulatory approval.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is now open.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Hi, thank you. I just had a quick one on how MiniSeq and MiSeq performed. Could you kind of give us color because historically, you commented that there would be some degree of cannibalization in sales, can you just kind of give us a basket idea of collectively how MiniSeq and MiSeq kind of performed as a group this quarter versus maybe last year, which would have only been MiSeq, and kind of how you expect that ramp and MiniSeq specifically to continue over the course of this year?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If you recall we had projected nominally a 20% to 25% cannibalization rate of MiSeq. We're seeing a rate so far at least that's less than that, and part of it is an interesting phenomenon where the low price point of the MiniSeq opens the door to a new customer, and then as we begin to engage with that customer we use it as an up-selling opportunity to sell them a MiSeq rather than a MiniSeq. And so we're seeing that phenomenon working well for our sales people because they love to sell $100,000 instrument rather than $50,000 one, if they have the option to do so. Having said that, the MiniSeq product did well in its first quarter. We've got a great pipeline there, and we're continuing to be optimistic about MiniSeq. And the data we have today at least indicates a lower cannibalization rate of MiSeq than we would have expected previously.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a follow up one on MiniSeq. Do you have sense at this point for what we should be building in as a range for quarterly replacements? And I know there is the long tail of labs that would like to do sequencing. Have you found this customer class is more responsive to an instrument sale approach versus reagent rental?","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(01:05:48) too early for us to have any data on that Jack. So we're continuing to look at this, and the number of customers that actually crossed the finish line, got it installed, and actually running these at any volume is still a relatively small number. So it's too early for us to put an estimate out there. In general, what we've used across the product line is about half of the purchase price, I think in this product, or probably less than that. So I've modeled something less, significantly less than half...","Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury","12 to 15 (01:06:18).","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, yes, exactly. So we'll be looking probably three or four quarters out before we actually start quoting what the actual range is running.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then, just one for modeling out. I know here in May, you're not ready to be talking about 2017, let alone 2018 or 2019, but I think one of the moving pieces of the income statement across the Street is the R&D line item, just given some of the expenses you're planning for both GRAIL and Helix. Can you just give us a framework for what we should be building in, in terms of long-term expenditures in R&D is closer to revenue growth, or do you think some of these new products we should be building in something more than that? Thank you.","Jay T. Flatley - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, clearly, GRAIL and Helix in many ways are incremental to what we're doing before, and we should be thinking about them as such. These are very important strategic bets that we think are the most important market opportunities for us to be working on. But the base level of R&D and the growth rates you've seen over the past couple of quarters will begin to moderate based on the absolute number, will begin to moderate based on the the absolute (01:07:29) asset growth rate will moderate in the R&D lines because of the actions we're taking to slowdown hiring, and that's important to more closely match what's happening in R&D with the recast revenue growth rate. And so we'll be analyzing this over the next quarter and probably give you a little bit more update next quarter, not guidance for 2017 or 2018, but probably a little more qualitative statement about what you can think about R&D and sales and marketing.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Yeah. One of these we have studied, and if you take out GRAIL and Helix over any three-year time horizon, there is enough leverage in our operating model organically. So we continue to believe that.","Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury","Thanks, Jack.","Operator","Thank you.

I'm pleased to report the Illumina team delivered a strong third quarter with revenue growing 18% year-over-year to $714 million. With solid results across our portfolio, it is clear that Illumina is both enabling and accelerating the global adoption of sequencing applications.","At Illumina, our mission is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome, and our commitment to innovation, while clear across our portfolio, is most recently demonstrated with the launch of the NovaSeq system. We believe NovaSeq is a transformative platform that enables existing sequencing customers to increase output and lower costs while, at the same time, lowering the barriers for new-to-sequencing customers.","Ultimately, our goal is to unlock the benefits of sequencing for as many people as possible. With that in mind, we are very pleased with NovaSeq's performance since its launch in early January. In total, we have shipped approximately 200 systems in the first three quarters of 2017, including more than 80 in the third quarter.","As expected, NovaSeq's shipments increased sequentially from last quarter, with shipments no longer constrained by manufacturing capacity. With approximately 70 orders in the quarter, we ended Q3 with a backlog of more than 100 systems. Going forward and as expected, backlog should start to trend downwards now that manufacturing constraints are behind us. Overall, we are currently on track to significantly exceed the 2017 forecast we targeted at launch.","As expected, most of our third quarter NovaSeq orders came from existing HiSeq customers. We are seeing robust demand from HiSeq customers upgrading their infrastructure, and are still in the early stages of the upgrade wave. We remain confident that most of our 800 HiSeq customers will upgrade to NovaSeq to access its power, improved work flow and lower sequencing costs, especially with the introduction of the S4 and S1 flow cells. Additionally, NextSeq will continue to be the go-to platform for a subset of HiSeq customers.","Moving to HiSeq X. Many of our HiSeq X customers have ordered their first NovaSeqs to start validations in new projects. It's worth noting that these very high volume customers will generally align their fleet transitions with the completion of existing projects.","As a result, we expect to continue to see strong NovaSeq uptake through the fourth quarter of 2017 into 2018 and beyond. Additionally, we are seeing continued signs of elasticity with about one-third of NovaSeq orders in Q3 coming from new-to-Illumina sequencing are previously benchtop-only customers. Examples include a children's hospital in North America that has purchased a NovaSeq to bring sequencing in-house, and an existing MiSeq and NextSeq customer that is moving to NovaSeq to begin providing exome sequencing and liquid biopsy tests.","We also saw a growing multi-unit NextSeq customer that is moving to NovaSeq to leverage the increased throughput on a system that occupies a smaller footprint overall, requires less FTE time and offers a lower cost per sample. We therefore believe we are still in the earliest stages of a multiyear adoption cycle that extends well beyond our HiSeq customer population.","Moving to sequencing consumables, we continue to see strong adoption with growth of 14% year-over-year to $380 million. The $42 million sequential growth in sequencing consumables represents the largest ever sequential dollar increase in our sequencing consumable business. This was driven by growth in our installed base and strong NextSeq utilization, in addition to stronger-than-expected HiSeq consumables.","HiSeq consumables increased sequentially driven by a few of our large clinical commercial customers who are seeing growing sample volume. Excluding this group of customers, HiSeq consumables declined. Our expectation remains that HiSeq consumables will trend lower going forward given the transition to NovaSeq and NextSeq.","As expected, we saw a slight sequential pickup in HiSeq X consumables driven by translational studies and growth in China. With the S4 flow cell now broadly available, we expect HiSeq X consumables to follow a similar trend to HiSeq consumables, with the decline to begin sometime in the coming quarters.","Moving to our benchtop portfolio, system shipments were essentially flat from the second quarter. Our win rates remain stable and new-to-sequencing customers represented over half of NextSeq, MiniSeq and MiSeq placements. Utilization was within each benchtop instrument's respective guidance range, except for a record NextSeq performance that exceeded the upper end of our range and was once again driven by production clinical customers.","In terms of new product launches, we delivered the new S4 flow cell to early-access customers as expected. I'm pleased to share that feedback on initial runs at seven customer sites have been very positive with performance exceeding specifications.","Building on the S2 flow cell, the new S4 flow cell enables a lower price per sample compared to HiSeq X for customers in our highest tiers of utilization and is therefore ideally suited for high-intensity sequencing applications. S4 is now commercially available.","We are also gearing up for the release of the NovaSeq Xp workflow and reagents. This is the individually addressable lane workflow that we first announced back in April. The device enables libraries to be loaded directly into each lane of the flow cell allowing customers to partition different libraries, projects, samples and applications. We expect to begin beta testing in the coming weeks, ahead of a full commercial release expected before the end of the year.","The next flow cell we're working to add to the portfolio is the S1, which we now expect to bring to the market in the first quarter of 2018. The S1 is the lowest output flow cell for NovaSeq at 1 terabase per run or 500 gigabases per flow cell. This is expected to be a very attractive upgrade option for HiSeq 2500 customers, including those who utilize the rapid run option.","The addition of S1 will nicely round out our flow cell portfolio, which can now accommodate data yields of between 500 gigabases and 6 terabases. We have suspended plans for an S3 flow cell with an output of 4 terabases given strong customer preference to use S4 for high-output applications and either S1 or S2 for lower-output applications.","You may also recall that we had plans for a lower output and marginally lower cost NovaSeq system, the 5000, to run just the S1 and S2 flow cells.","Based on customer feedback and our experience over the last three quarters, we believe that the existing 6000 fully meets all customer needs in addition to enable greater flexibility to scale in the future without an additional capital purchase. Consistent with our broader objective to streamline our product portfolio, we have therefore decided not to launch the NovaSeq 5000, instead focusing on the 6000.","At Illumina, we strongly believe that sequencing offers the promise to transform lives and are encouraged to see sequencing continue its progress into clinical application. In the third quarter, shipments to our clinical customers grew 35%, largely driven by our liquid biopsy customers. More specifically, oncology testing shipment growth accelerated from last quarter.","The FDA's approval of KYMRIAH as the first immune cell therapy is, of course, a very exciting development for the field of oncology, opening a whole new world of possibility for gene and cell therapies. Sequencing is an important enabler in the discovery of immunotherapies, and with approximately 1,000 immuno-oncology drugs and clinical trials in the U.S. alone, Illumina is committed to supporting our customers as they endeavor to deliver new hope to cancer patients and their families.","Another important area for Illumina is rare and undiagnosed diseases, where patients, including newborns and their families, can find themselves on a multi-year odyssey searching for a diagnosis. There are more than 7,000 genetic disorders that aren't well known enough to be routinely identified by physicians, but that can now be identified by genomic analysis. The right diagnosis can reduce pain and enable earlier and potentially life-impacting or life-saving therapies.","It was, therefore, great to see UnitedHealthcare's recent decision to cover whole exome sequencing for the diagnosis or evaluation of genetic disorders in patients and their parents and siblings. Starting on November 1, UnitedHealthcare will cover whole exome sequencing for patients where clinical presentation is nonspecific and does not fit a well-defined syndrome for which a specific or targeted gene test is available. Once the UnitedHealthcare decision takes effect next week, more than 100 million lives will be covered for whole exome sequencing for rare and undiagnosed diseases in the U.S. This compares to almost none a year ago.","Finally, in its first full quarter of availability following the CE-IVD release, our VeriSeq NIPT CE-IVD solution delivered another strong quarter, with the number of shipped samples and revenue almost doubling sequentially. The product is performing well in competitive tenders and we added a sizable German customer during the quarter that will start ramping around the end of the year.","Moving back to the quarter, microarray revenue grew 27% to $121 million with continued momentum among our direct-to-consumer customers. Helix formally launched in July, creating a completely new marketplace for emerging consumer genomics. During the quarter, they added six new apps from four new partners, bringing the total number of products available to 26. At the same time, Helix is exploring new commercial avenues with a selection of products now available on amazon.com and has teamed up with Illumina Accelerator to support innovative start-up companies working to create breakthrough DNA-driven products for consumers.","Before I hand the call over to Sam, I want to share with you a change in one of our leadership roles. I'm happy to announce that Marc Stapley has accepted the role of EVP of Strategy and Corporate Development responsible for corporate strategy, corporate and business development, government affairs and global infrastructure, including IT and facilities. Marc has been an invaluable partner to me as Chief Administrative Officer and has hired some exceptional leaders, while helping our G&A functions develop in scale.","As a result of the change, our CFO, Sam Samad; General Council, Chuck Dadswell; and the new Chief People Officer, when hired, will report directly to me. I'm looking forward to have Marc now focus on driving our strategy process and getting more deeply involved in key transactions, including our population sequencing efforts.","Finally, I'll highlight that Illumina Ventures raised $230 million for its first genomics-focused fund. To-date, Illumina Ventures has made investments in seven early-stage companies in industries ranging from novel therapeutics, diagnostics and research tools to food security and synthetic biology.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Sam for a review of our quarterly financials. Sam?","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks, Francis. As discussed, third quarter revenue grew 18% year-over-year to $714 million, largely driven by growth in sequencing consumables and instruments, as well as strong performance across our microarrays portfolio. Geographically, Americas grew revenue 20% versus the prior-year period, while EMEA grew 15% driven by growth in both sequencing instruments and consumables.","Asia-Pacific grew 15% overall as continued weakness in Japan was more than offset by the more than 30% shipment growth in Greater China. Revenue from sequencing instruments grew 21% year-over-year to $128 million, driven primarily by NovaSeq and offset in part by muted shipments of the HiSeq family of instruments as expected.","Microarray instruments had an unusually strong quarter at $12 million, driven primarily by shipments to our direct-to-consumer customers. Total instrument revenue was therefore $140 million, an increase of 24% year-over-year, and represented 20% of total revenue. As Francis noted, third quarter sequencing consumable revenue was $380 million, up 14% from last year.","Microarray consumable revenue of $71 million was up 13%. Total consumable revenue of $451 million represented 63% of total revenue. Third quarter total product revenue, which includes freight, was $596 million, up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Service and other was $118 million, up 26% from the same quarter last year, driven by strength in genotyping services due to consumer demand and sequencing instrument maintenance contracts.","Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's earnings release and supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 68.8% improved 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable sequencing consumables mix, with growth in NovaSeq and NextSeq. Year-over-year gross margin decreased 320 basis points and was impacted by an increase in array services mix and lower instrument margin associated with the NovaSeq introduction. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $299 million, up $2 million from last quarter with higher Helix launch expenses and increased head count, offset in part by lower stock-based compensation expense.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.8%, up 470 basis points sequentially and lower than the 28.7% reported in the third quarter of last year. Excluding Helix, operating margin was 29.7% compared to 24.4% in the second quarter.","For the third quarter, GAAP net income attributable to Illumina stockholders was $163 million or $1.11 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Illumina stockholders was also $163 million or $1.11 per diluted share, and Helix dilution was $0.07. Of note, our non-GAAP tax rate of 21.6% was lower than expected, with a onetime benefit associated with the increase in income attributable to overseas manufacturing, compared to what we forecasted earlier this year. We saw additional benefit with R&D credits and foreign tax credits on prior year returns filed in the third quarter.","Cash flow from operations equaled $235 million. Improved revenue linearity and continued reductions in our collections cycle led to Q3 DSO of 49 days compared to 51 days last quarter. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $82 million and Q3 free cash flow was $153 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 385,000 shares under our previously announced buyback program at an average price of $195.","Moving to guidance, we now expect full-year revenue growth of approximately 13%. For the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect a more typical sequential increase in sequencing consumable revenue. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be slightly up from the third quarter, and fourth non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat to slightly up on a dollar basis from the third quarter.","Finally, we expect a more normalized tax rate for the fourth quarter. We therefore expect full-year 2017 GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.56 to $5.61 and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $3.73 to $3.78.","Before we start the Q&A, I'd like to formally welcome Jacquie Ross to the Illumina Investor Relations team. As most of you know, Jacquie has taken over from Rebecca Chambers who has moved to a new leadership role in our finance organization. We thank Rebecca for her many contributions as Head of IR at Illumina since 2012, and I know you will join me in wishing her every success in her new role.","Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good afternoon.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Hi, Derik. How are you?","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good. So, first question, so \u2013 and you sort of alluded it to. Sam sort of alluded to it, but 14% consumable growth in the quarter, up 24% quarter-on-quarter, 14% year-over-year. I guess with that stocking of NovaSeq agents in the quarter and you said more traditional ramp on Q3 to Q4. And just the consumable numbers nimble and chop the last few quarters. I'm just wondering what's the normal ramp.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, I think when we look at Q4 going forward, Derik, I think we'll go back to a normal ramp which is consistent with what we've seen typically the growth of our consumables. We did have, in Q1 and Q2, a slight dip in consumables driven by what we thought was destocking of inventories. And as we look forward, we expect to see the growth of NovaSeq consumables take off.","We expect to see HiSeq consumables come down per expectations. And with HiSeq X consumables going forward, that's going be a little bit lumpy, as we said before, because we expect \u2013 we've had some noise with some of the continuation of experiments on the HiSeq X platform. But that's going be a bit lumpy as we go forward. Now, we have the S4 introduction so we might see ups and downs, but eventually, we will see HiSeq X consumables come down and see that offset by the growth in NovaSeq consumables.","So, that's kind of the trends going forward without giving you a number in terms of our growth rate, but that's what you should expect in terms of directionally for sequencing consumables.","Jacquie Ross - Illumina, Inc.","I'll just add, Derik, that on the NextSeq side, essentially, we did say that that was above the high end of the range for the quarter, and so, it's not clear what will happen to that in Q4 as well.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm sorry. You said NextSeq above the high end of the range?","Jacquie Ross - Illumina, Inc.","It was above the high end of the range this quarter.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. Okay. And I guess the delay in the S1 chip is \u2013 could you talk a little about that? I thought it was my understanding essentially was, it was going to be released about the same time as the S4. Can you talk about that, I guess? Is there any concern about meeting flow cell capacity or is it just a research delay because of where the demand for flow cells or is there some manufacturing issues that you're trying to overcome?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. It's a modest delay and the team prioritized in this quarter of getting the Xp workflow and the S4 flow cell out.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","And so, that continues. And the team is currently working on it optimizing the S1 chemistries. And so, we expect that to come out in Q1.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I guess, question on the instrument side. As we think about NovaSeq mix here, I know you talked about one-third of orders from new to sequence customers, kind of consistent with last quarter, but can you talk a little bit about how much is coming from benchtop only versus that legacy HiSeq base versus X customers?","And then, given the price gap between the 5000 and 6000, I think it was about $200,000 when you first announced it. What gives you confidence that lower end customers that may have been 5000 customers will actually trade up into the 6000, now that you've canceled the 5000?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, for now, two quarters in a row, we've seen a good demand, a healthy demand, come from new to Illumina sequencing as well as benchtop only, and we've talked about the fact that it was about one-third of orders that came in for NovaSeq in these two quarters coming from that segment.","The majority, therefore, and just do the math, the majority did come from typically HiSeq customers and HiSeq X customers. We are definitely seeing the beginning of the HiSeq upgrade wave. In the last quarter, we talked about the fact that about 10% or just over 10% of the HiSeq customers have bought NovaSeqs. We obviously added to that number in this quarter. And we're starting to see X customers buy and validate their first NovaSeqs and start to think about the fleet replatforming. Now that we've put S4 out, we expect to see more of those happening in the coming quarters. And so, we expect to see more multi-unit orders come in now that we've put S4 out there.","In terms of the 5000 and the 6000, as you'll recall, Tycho, typically, we do have sort of a lighter end version of most instruments we put out, right? So, we had the HiSeq 3000 and the 4000. We had the NextSeq 500 and the 550, and we fully expected that that would be the dynamic here with NovaSeq as well.","And what we found from talking to customers and our field force really sort of amplified that feedback back to the leadership team, is that in this case, there was a lot of demand for the 6000, so for the next platform to be the 6000 for our high throughput customers. And there weren't a lot of customers asking for and certainly not waiting for the 5000.","And so, what's playing out right now is that the choice our customers are having is if they want a high throughput instrument, they're looking at the 6000. Otherwise, they're looking at the NextSeq. And so, as we think about the upgrade opportunity for HiSeqs, we expect the majority of them will go to NovaSeqs, but then, there'll be a number of them that opt to get one or more NextSeqs instead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just to follow-up, can you just talk a little bit about the types of work being done on Nova? I know you've had it out a couple quarters. How much is exome versus full genome versus other applications?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","We haven't broken it out, but certainly, some of the anecdotal feedback I can share is that we're seeing sort of all of the above right now. We are seeing customers that are new to sequencing getting into the game and are looking to do whole exomes or whole genomes. An example of that would be a new to sequencing customer that we got out of the Middle East that bought NovaSeq to participate in the second phase of the Saudi whole genome project, for example, or the hospital that I talked about in North America that previously didn't do any of their sequencing in-house, and now, bought a NovaSeq so that they don't have to outsource the sequencing that they do.","We're seeing a customer out in Greater China, for example, that purchased NovaSeqs to support their collaboration with a genome alliance in that region. In that case, there was genomes. And then, we talked about what's playing out with rugged, rare and undiagnosed diseases, where there's reimbursement now for whole exome trio sequencing. And so, hospitals that look to provide that will be looking at potentially NovaSeqs to do exomes.","And so, at this point, it's too early to break it out specifically, but we're seeing all of the above. We're seeing people getting into from panels to exomes. We're seeing exomes to genomes, new to genomes. And then, we talked about demand coming from oncology applications, like liquid biopsy.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Hi, Bill.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Hi.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","First question is, I guess, just on the S4 launch. Certainly, our diligence has picked up a couple of times. There appears to be a healthy customer segment that's been waiting for that particular flow cell to be released. And so, I recognize you don't want to talk inter-quarter orders or anything like that, but can you just talk about the pace of interest and any color you'd like to add with respect to orders since you've released the S4 just a couple weeks ago? Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. And what I share with you will be again anecdotal, but certainly, the economics makes sense for the X customers to really excite about the S4 in a way that frankly, the other flow cells aren't as exciting to them.","And so, if you look at how the conversations are playing out with some of our HiSeq X customers, some of them did purchase NovaSeqs. But there are more NovaSeqs so they can get familiar with the instrument and the platform, understand the workflow, understand the differences. But for the majority of the HiSeq X customers, moving the fleet over to NovaSeq really makes sense once the S4 is out, and that's how this market's playing out.","In some cases, the HiSeq X customers waited for the S4 to get into NovaSeq at all. And in other cases, they got in but are looking at the S4 as the enablement that they were waiting for to move their fleets over.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you for that. And then, I guess slightly changing subjects here, Helix. Francis, are we at a point where we can talk about kind of the relative contribution of that now that we have some additional apps launched and it appears to be kind of a broader rollout at this point? And if so, any way you can help us think about kind of the magnitude of that business maybe relative to some of the other DTC customers that you support? Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","It's still too early for us to talk about the contribution that Helix will have. They announced, they launched last quarter, so only a few months post their launch. And so, they're still in their ramp-up phase. I think sometime over the course of the next year, it'll make more sense for us to give you more details on that business, but again, it's too early right now.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. And it's still not material in terms of our overall revenues to discuss.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. I have a, I guess, it's one multi-part question going back to sequencing consumables. First, you provided a lot of detail on legacy consumables revenue. What you didn't say is how much of the $42 million sequential jump in consumable revenue growth was driven by NovaSeq. Can you provide additional detail? I guess, basically, I'm just asking how much of the increase is attributable to NovaSeq specifically?","Second, a bigger but more important question, and I think it's one of, if not, the biggest questions with the NovaSeq launch, is whether or not it's going to lead to labs spending more on consumables than it did before? For example, if a lab spent $700,000 annually on consumables on two HiSeqs one year and swaps out their two HiSeqs for a NovaSeq, will that lab end up spending more than $700,000 on consumables on that new NovaSeq? How confident, based on what you're seeing now, in the answer being yes, that NovaSeq will lead to more consumable spending per lab and when can we expect to see this?","And the third part is really just a clarification. When you comment on sequential growth per sequencing instrument, is that growth in both total revenue per instrument and overall revenue per instrument class? Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","All right. Let me take a cut at the answers. So, the $42 million sequential consumable growth was driven by growth across all of our platforms. So if you look at every single one of our platforms, we saw sequential growth in sequencing consumables. But, obviously, the growth wasn't equal.","So if you look at the high throughput part of our portfolio, the biggest part of the growth in that part of the portfolio came from NovaSeq. And so, that was the biggest contributor on the high throughput part of the portfolio to the sequential sequencing consumable growth that we saw.","On the benchtop side, again, although every platform grew, the biggest contributor to that growth was NextSeq, and so \u2013 but all our platforms grew. It was really NovaSeq and NextSeq that were the big drivers of the consumables growth that you \u2013 sequencing consumables growth that you saw sequentially.","In terms of will NovaSeq lead to labs spending more in consumables, we are at the stage where we can share some anecdotal feedback. And what we are hearing is that certainly with S4, there are applications, there are samples that become accessible at the price points that S4 affords. That will lead over time to labs being able to access additional funding and drive more consumable spend. We're at the beginning of that obviously with S4 coming out and giving customers access to price points for those large-scale projects that they didn't have before.","And so, we are encouraged by seeing a lot of new customers come in to buy NovaSeq because they believe that thesis. What's still in front of us, then, is to see that pull-through show up in NovaSeq consumables, but the early indicators in terms of people buying instruments, in terms of new customers coming in, is very positive.","And I actually didn't capture the third question. I don't know if you guys did. Can you repeat it, Doug?","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Hey, can you repeat it?","Jacquie Ross - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Just clarifying when you commented on sequential growth per sequencing instrument, is that both total revenue per instrument and overall revenue per instrument class? I guess I'm just trying to see if what you meant by that was that pull through per instrument across all instruments increased sequentially.","Jacquie Ross - Illumina, Inc.","Let me check into that and then get back to you, Doug.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Afternoon, guys. Francis, maybe just to take a shot at the decommission trade-in dynamic around the Xs and the HiSeqs. I'm curious whether you're finding that there's sort of a level of utilization that tends to trigger customers shutting down the box. Obviously, some of these guys are keeping their existing systems and others aren't. So, I'm just wondering whether you're noticing any sort of commonality amongst those that are doing the trade in math?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, let's talk about both the trade-in and the decommissioning. Our conversations aren't really driven as much by the utilization rates. What we're finding is it's driven by what customers expect in terms of their business plans going forward.","And so, again, some of them are new that didn't have the history but are getting into NovaSeqs and it's based on a business plan that they see accessible to them now, whether it's the new customer we have that decided to get into the whole exome, whole genome sequencing servicing market. And so, it's much more driven by business plans going forward rather than the utilization rate by far (35:30). There's some overlap between the two but it's not a perfect overlap there.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","In terms of decommission, just for the numbers, we removed approximately 23 instruments from the HiSeq installed base and we did not decommission any Xs from the installed base.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Great. That's helpful. And then, maybe just sort of switch topics a little bit, Francis or Sam, can you maybe help us with our models on the (35:56) line? I'm thinking specifically on Verinata, the NIPT volumes transitioned out of house. Would you be willing to sort of talk volumes or maybe even revenue expectations for this year versus last year?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","At this point, we're not talking about the specific volumes because we've moved away from reporting those volumes, so we don't have that to share with you. What we are sharing is the market dynamic, right? And so, from a market dynamic perspective, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress we are seeing in terms of NIPT reimbursement, both in the United States where we're now at 39% of the population, about 150 million lives that are covered for an NIPT testing.","And then, the progress we're seeing in Europe have some countries that are covering NIPT testing for the entire population. And so, we see that happening in the Netherlands, for example, in Belgium, and then, countries like England and France where we're starting to see parts of the population getting covered.","So, we continue to see progress in terms of people having access to the test, which is then driving the sample volume growth that we talked about and that obviously will then drive revenue growth.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Massaro from Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey. Thanks, guys. So last week at ASHG, Bill Gates gave a keynote and he talked about the gut microbiome is being something he's most excited about, but then, he went into surprisingly R&A sequencing, metabolomics and proteomics. I guess, my question for you is which area of research are you most excited about and that you think that the NovaSeq can unlock and drive consumables utilization near term?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, there are a number of areas that are emerging that we're excited about. We're excited about the whole area of single cell research. We think that is a new research paradigm that is driving a lot of very exciting projects to understand the differential expression across cell types, even in a single tissue. We're excited about the research that's happening and this is more commercially oriented, but in immune-oncology, for example, we think that that's driving some very exciting research.","I'm never going to be on the side of arguing against Bill Gates. And in this case, I actually agree that metagenomics is also a very promising and exciting area and for genomics, in addition to proteomics. So, I think that's an interesting area, too, and has, in the long term, some really exciting potential.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And just as a quick follow-up, can you give us a sense for the interest from biopharma, if that's picking up at all, as it relates to doing some of their own sequencing?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","We continue to see demand growing over the long term from that segment. We talked about the fact specifically, for example, that sequencing is a core tool in immuno-oncology and immunotherapies. And so, that area continues to be an exciting one that we are watching that holds promise, not just for us but for patients as well. And so, we see them as a growing part of our business and I expect that'll continue to be so for a long time.","Mark Anthony Massaro - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks, guys. Looking at the market size for NovaSeq, I guess with another quarter of one-third of the customers being new to sequencing as the kind of orders here, has that changed your expectation for the market size, given this recent trend? And then, it seems that's boosting the market size from the bottom, and then, maybe NextSeq is capturing a few customers you expected on the lower utilization side. So, are those two dynamics offsetting or maybe just kind of how you think about the market relative to your initial expectations?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, I'll start by saying that \u2013 and we said this this quarter, we said this last quarter, that we are very pleased with how NovaSeq is performing, and it is on track to exceed the full-year plan we had for NovaSeq coming into this year and exceeded comfortably. So overall, we are very pleased with how it's playing out in the market.","We continue to believe that in the long term, the vast majority of our HiSeq customers will upgrade and most of them will move to NovaSeq. Now, we expect some of them to move to NextSeq and that's good for us, too, but we do expect that most of them will move to NovaSeq.","The one-third new to sequencing is incremental, obviously, to the upgrade wave that we are looking at. And that's encouraging to see it play out the way it's playing out now for two quarters in a row.","So overall, I'd say we are very happy. We are exceeding our plan for the year. We do believe, we continue to believe, though, that this is a multi-year upgrade path. So coming into the year, we thought it was a three to five-year upgrade wave and we continue to believe that.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","And just to clarify, within that one-third, it includes also previously benchtop only customers. So, we see evidence of customers moving up to NovaSeq as well as I agree with Francis' point, a portion of that 800 customers will move down to NextSeq from HiSeq.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Helpful. Maybe one for Sam, just on the margin side. When we think about Nova, obviously, still dilutive early in the ramp. But how should we think about the margin profile over the long term, relative to maybe some of the other instruments out there?","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. As you said, I mean, as with any product introduction, I think, in the few quarters, you will see some of the initial costs which we've been working through, improving. The margin profile has been improving for NovaSeq. That's helped also drive our overall gross margin improvement for the quarter.","I think, going forward, what you need to expect, which will play out over the coming quarters, is that NovaSeq will essentially approach the \u2013 and I'm talking about the instrument here, will approach the margin profile of HiSeq and close to HiSeq X but not quite at the HiSeq X level. So, that's at the instrument level.","Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. So I just had, I guess, a higher level question, just if you think about long-term growth. We get asked a lot, I'm sure everyone does about just, I guess, thinking about what new applications or new markets that NovaSeq enables. And so \u2013 and you talked a bit about how people are using the platform. I just was curious how you're thinking about it over time and what you've seen historically. Obviously, there's this idea of doing more samples because it's lower cost and then more complexity in terms of the samples that you have currently. But if you think kind of longer term, would you agree that to drive growth that you would need to expand into liquid biopsy or something that's kind of new? Or is that not the right way to think about it?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","We definitely believe that NovaSeq will enable new types of sequencing to be done on a number of fronts. So, NovaSeq fundamentally enables larger experiments, larger cohorts. And that could be at the macro scale, so population sequencing efforts I think are more accessible to more customers than they were before because of NovaSeq. But also at the micro scale. So we expect to see, and we are seeing, lots of exciting single-cell projects being contemplated because of the economics and the power of NovaSeq.","And so we expect, on the one hand, NovaSeq will enable access to larger cohorts at every scale in a way that hasn't been done before. We also expect and we're seeing that, even with the same size of cohorts, we're seeing a lot of sequencing intensive applications being done more. So the growth in liquid biopsy is enabled by people having access and more customers having access to more power at lower costs. And that's what NovaSeq does.","So the liquid biopsy market, I think, is accelerated by something like NovaSeq. We will, we believe, continue to see the movement from single-gene panels to multi-gene panels to exomes to genomes, right? And actually, interestingly enough, I think the recent PAMA decision also helps that where there's the reimbursement framework starting to be set for the larger multi-gene panels.","But I do think you'll start to see this migration to doing bigger panels and then doing exomes and doing genomes. And we're starting to see that, but it's early in that journey. But over the course of multiple years, we all know you do better science; you get higher diagnostic yield as you move up that continuum. And NovaSeq is helpful in that dimension.","And then the applications that require sort of needle in a haystack type work, and that's again like liquid biopsy where you need to do very, very, very deep sequencing to find the rare event, the rare molecule. And there's a set of those applications that can now be enabled with the power of NovaSeq. And so, on a multiyear horizon, we do believe that NovaSeq fundamentally enables new types of sequencing at the cohorts, larger cohort scale, but also at the more intense, deeper sequencing scale.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on the liquid biopsy side. So, obviously, I guess, GRAIL has talked about a product longer term and there's products already on the market for later-stage patients. But do you think, just thinking about the research dollars that are being moved into liquid biopsies, is that enough to move the needle for you guys near term, so thinking the next 12 months? Is that enough to be reasonably additive to whatever the consumable or instrumentation growth over the next year?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","I think on sort of both categories, I think if you look at the \u2013 on the screening side, there are a number of companies now that have been resourced and financed to look into that market. So it's not just GRAIL anymore. And in aggregate, I think that's additive to our business as a whole. And it's sort of a positive.","We've talked before about the fact that GRAIL had the potential to be among our biggest customers. And to the extent that you have more companies that are doing sequencing intensive applications in very large-scale studies like that, having more customers that show up among our biggest customers is definitely good for our business.","That will probably play out over time and unclear to say what the actual overall impact in 2018 will be. But that is a very healthy dynamic in general. Similarly, if you look for later stage, whether it's therapy selection or monitoring, again, that brings NGS into segments of oncology where there was no NGS before. And oncology remains one of the big market opportunities where NGS can really make a difference. And so I think it's all incremental in terms of driving our penetration into oncology, and that remains a very big opportunity, we believe.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well, I'd first like to start on a bit lighter note and just say \u2013 I'll reiterate the welcome to Jacquie. It's great to have you back.","Jacquie Ross - Illumina, Inc.","Thank you. Appreciate that.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","My first topic on a more serious note comes back to the very popular topic of sequencing consumables. I wonder if we could do two things. One, could we do just a little bit of retrospective? As you went back and looked at the trends in the first half of the year, do you still think that there was a significant amount of the consumables destocking in the first half of the year? And have you given any more thought to how big an impact that had?","And then sort of a related question here in the third quarter also on sequencing consumables, it seems like there are a number of different constituents who had pretty significant ordering patterns, ordering patterns above trend in the quarter, setting aside the obvious, NovaSeq stocking. What would be the binding thread? Why would the growth across these different constituencies be simultaneously so strong? And then I have a follow-up.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Sure. We did anticipate coming into the year that, as we launch NovaSeq, you would see some destocking, and that's what played out in Q1. And if you look at it, it's primarily the handful of X customers potentially that we felt would destock as they looked at NovaSeq.","If I look at the consumable growth, the sequencing consumable growth that we saw in Q3, it was across the board, across every platform that we had. And so I think when we started to break down, okay, could the destocking have played a factor here? It certainly could have and it likely did probably maybe in one of those platforms. I think for HiSeq X it's possible, for example, or HiSeq. But if you look across the board, I said we saw sequencing consumable growth across every single platform. And the story, there are stories around each segment of the market and why that's growing.","For example, we continue to see our clinical commercial customers grow, and that's driven by growth in samples in the markets that they're addressing, whether that's in oncology or in NIPT, and that's starting to flow through, for example, in NextSeq or in MiSeq or it could be some in HiSeq.","And so what's happening is, across the board, we're seeing demand grow. And that's starting to show up across our different platforms. In X and in NovaSeq, you're starting to see the dynamic of NovaSeq is ramping up. And so there's a little bit potentially of the destocking that's playing out in that part of the market. But again, I think across the board, what we're seeing with our customers is they are seeing demand, and that's driving them spending more on consumables.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I really appreciate all that color. The follow-up is much, much simpler and it's on microarray service. It's been a really good driver of growth this year, and we know, of course, there are some good success stories behind that. But what do you think is a medium-term reasonable growth rate for microarray services given everything you see going on out there? Thanks so much.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","It's definitely been a good growth story for us and there are a number of drivers from it. A big driver obviously has been the direct-to-consumer market. Those customers have continued to exceed their own plans for growth. And that then translated into the demand that you're seeing from us. But there are other segments that are playing out, too. For example, agriculture is a very interesting segment and continues to drive demand for our microarray products.","We expect to see the demand continue to grow from their customers' perspective. You talk to ag customers, they're looking to expand either the types of species that they're looking to sequence. They're looking to actually expand the production sequencing that they do. If you talk to our DTC customers, they believe that they are still in the very early stages of this big consumer genomics market. And so, from a demand perspective, our customers will tell us that if you look out into the horizon, they expect demand to continue to grow and that we're at the very early stages of those markets.","We're also, though, talking to them about moving to sequencing. And if that happens, obviously, then you'll see a decline in the microarray line. But that's really good news for customers and their customers because that means they are getting more value from the sequencing. And it's obviously terrific news for us at Illumina.","It's hard to predict, we're already seeing sequencing in the ag market, for example, and that's already starting to play out. So it's hard to know how much of this microarray demand will move to sequencing over time, and obviously, we're going to do everything we can to encourage that. And then the same thing on the DTC side. It's hard to predict if and when those markets will move to sequencing. And when that happens, obviously, you'll see microarrays come down and you'll see sequencing go up, which again is terrific for us.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks again.","Operator","And the next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. First question on the NovaSeq orders in the quarter, the 70 you mentioned. How are you thinking about that from a run rate perspective? Is that a pretty good run rate or are you thinking that that should accelerate or decelerate as you progress through in the launch here?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","So it's hard to call a specific run rate. I mean, we've been on the market now for \u2013 it's two quarters, not fully quite three quarters yet, and each one of them has had their own dynamic. Obviously, there was the launch quarter. There was a quarter when we were constrained by manufacturing. And this is the first quarter we are exiting without being constrained by manufacturing.","And so I don't think we're at the stage yet where we can call an order run rate. I will say, though, that, as we looked \u2013 coming into this year, we looked at the curves, the order curves by quarter for some of our previous instruments, including the X. And what we're seeing with NovaSeq is consistent with what we saw with the X. So, at this stage, it's not yet at the regular run rate basis, but the curves are similar to what we've seen before. It'll take a few more quarters, I think, before we get to a steady state of orders per quarter.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","And I would just add, exiting Q3 as well, we have a very strong backlog in terms of NovaSeq instruments, which has built up because of some of the production constraints that we had, which we are now past.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And for my follow-up, I want to touch on the 35% growth in shipments to the clinical market. Francis, you said that was largely from liquid biopsy. Can you comment from other segments of your clinical markets like tumor profiling or germline genetics, are you seeing anything in the customer base around the prior authorization requirements for genetic testing? Is that causing any hesitancy in that market or is that not a factor?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Look, we believe that prior authorization will add friction into the market as a whole. And so, over time, that's something we want to help the industry work through. It hasn't showed up in terms of impacting our demand at this stage. And when I talked about the growth in the clinical market, one element certainly was the translational liquid biopsy studies that are going on. But we talked about the growth we're seeing in oncology testing as a whole even beyond liquid biopsies. We talked about the growth that we're seeing in NIPT in terms of the covered lives continuing to expand both here and internationally. And so there are a number of factors that are driving that 35% growth, not just the large liquid biopsy studies.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And the next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Hi, Francis. Thanks for taking my question. So, could you give us a sense of if there is any change in the timing of this, the $100 genome or reaching that price? Clearly, liquid biopsy has taken off here in the market with NovaSeq already. And I ask that because, at ASHG, we saw already presentations where clinically diagnostic genome is more of a near-term reality, and some of the pediatric labs and pediatric researchers are highlighting elements that are missing in exome. So just wanted to get your thoughts on the timing of that genome.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. I'll start by saying that I saw some of those things at ASHG too, and I think it is exciting to see the momentum that's building around the value of whole genome sequencing. I was talking to a customer at ASHG who said, look, it's clear to them that even if you wanted to do the best exome you could, the way you do it is you do a whole genome because you actually would find variance that you wouldn't find if you did whole exome sequencing, which is an interesting conversation. And I think from our perspective, it's exciting to see the momentum building around whole genome sequencing.","From a $100 a genome perspective, we continue to believe that that is attainable with the architecture that we have in NovaSeq. It is a multiyear goal, but we have line of sight into the technology improvements that get us from here to there. The thing that we are also working on then is trying to catalyze the sequencing intensive application demand so that we can continue to drive prices down, and it will be met with a demand that will be overall additive to the market size.","And so we have work going on from a technology perspective to enable that, but the rate at which we step the price down will be equally informed by our belief that the elasticity of the market is there to extend it at each price point that we take down.","We think that S4 for customers that reach the highest volumes do give you access to prices that are lower than you would have got with the X, and we believe that the market is ready for that. And so we think the elasticity is there by taking the prices per gene and therefore the prices per genome down below the X, it overall expands the market. So that's the first step towards the $100 genome as we put out S4 right now.","And we'll continue to step it down knowing that we can get there with this architecture, but it will be gated somewhat by in our belief that the market is there at any given point for the price point we put out.","Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. And then a quick question on the consumables. Just trying to understand. So if we look at the theoretical capacity of HiSeq 2500, 4000s and the HiSeq X, and the theoretical capacity of NovaSeq for an entire year, it seems to me that a number of permutation combinations, whatever you can try from S1 to S4, the consumable pull through is going be significant and likely to be higher than HiSeq X for NovaSeq in the long run. Have you given thought to essentially how that could potentially shake out longer term? And any sense, any color there would be helpful. Thanks and thanks for take the questions.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","So the \u2013 sorry, the question you're saying is that \u2013 let me make sure I understand it. So you're saying, look, if you look at the high throughput part of the portfolio, what is the dynamic that plays out as they move to NovaSeq? Is that the question that you're asking?","Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes. So if you have the theoretical capacity and the practical capacity which we have known in the past as \u2013 for HiSeq it was utilized at maybe \u2013 HiSeq 2500 maybe utilized at 20%, 25%, whereas HiSeq X was utilized at a more higher utilization rate, maybe potentially 50% when you average it across the world. So just trying to get a sense of how are you thinking about the practical utilization of NovaSeq when you look at the theoretical versus their practical capacity? And any color there would be helpful. Essentially trying to get to NovaSeq consumables in the long run, if you have any color there. Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So there are a number of things that are going to play out. One thing that we believe with NovaSeq is that it will push the elasticity of the market and that, by enabling customers to have access to lower price points, they will go after larger cohorts.","So, if you are a high-throughput customer, if you are an X customer, for example, you will look to do larger experiments. You will look to do single-cell experiments. You will look to do liquid biopsy experiments. And some of those you couldn't do on the X, by the way, because it was constrained to whole genomes, right?","And so, one thing that I think will drive elasticity \u2013 sorry, utilization beyond just moving your workloads from an X, for example, to NovaSeq is that part of that transition for a number of our customers includes a contemplation of workloads that they wouldn't do before without a NovaSeq. And that's true whether you're an X customer moving to NovaSeq or a 2500 customer moving NovaSeq.","As we think about the market, we think sort of overall we talked about the fact that utilization is in the 50-ish-percent and has been sort of approaching that now for a number of years and fairly stable. And so we're never designing to say, look, we want to have them running at 80%, 90%. And if that's happening, it would indicate to us maybe that there was too much centralization of the market.","And so the other dynamic that NovaSeq enables in the market is it democratizes access to high-throughput sequencing. And so you're seeing customers that were outsourcing a lot of their samples in some cases, and they're looking to move those in-house. And so the other dynamic the we're targeting with NovaSeq is to democratize access to high-throughput sequencing.","Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks, Francis.","Operator","And our last question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to start on the much discussed NGS consumables. If I take Sam's fourth quarter guidance, that would imply low teens level of growth for the full year. And I think that fully encapsulates the inventory stocking issues. Just compared to prior years' deceleration, can you give your thoughts on just the level of sequencing that's taking place? And do you think this can reaccelerate in 2018?","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Hard to comment on 2018 right now. I think you're in the right ballpark there in terms of your expectations. But, again, I go back to some of the factors that I mentioned earlier, which are really the important fundamental factors for us to look at here looking forward. And that is, as you look forward in terms of the progress or the growth sequentially on sequencing consumables, what you would expect, and it's early right now to comment definitively, but what you would expect is you would see NovaSeq to continue to increase in terms of the level of consumables quarter over quarter. We had a strong quarter this quarter, but we'll continue to see that going forward, especially now also with the S4 launch.","What you will see on HiSeq is that you will see it start to come down. And what you will see on HiSeq X is also eventually to start to come down, but obviously with some lumpiness. What you will also see, and what we saw this quarter, is that NextSeq also will experience or has experienced pretty strong sequential growth in Q3. And we would expect to see growth in NextSeq consumables as well.","So I won't give a specific figure in terms of what the 2018 expectations are, but those are the dynamics shaping our sequencing consumables sequential run rate.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's helpful, Sam. Then just wanted to dig in on one component that the HiSeq, how that's going trend. Can you just give us color in terms of the replacement cycle, how long you think that validation takes for NovaSeq? Just trying to pair the commentary for the quarter where HiSeq stepped up and some of the more limited replacements you've seen so far.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. I think \u2013 so when we talked about the HiSeq sequencing consumables, we said, look, that the \u2013 we expect that to go down over time. And the dynamic we saw play out last quarter was we had these large clinical commercial customers that were seeing growth in their business, and that drove the demand for HiSeq consumables last quarter that resulted in overall HiSeq consumables growing. We expect that to be a temporal dynamic, and we expect that over time there will be a cut-over.","Now, the validation point \u2013 with every customer, the validation of NovaSeq is unique to them. And one customer was telling me in two days they were ready to go. In other customer cases, it could take months for them to do the validations they need. And it's driven a little bit by whether they're a research customer or a clinical customer. But it's very much driven by the practices of that lab.","That I think is not going be the gating factor of how the HiSeq consumable bucket changes. I think it's going be driven by the dynamics of their business. And so, if you have customers that have large experiments that are running or that have extensive validation practices, that will determine how quickly they move over.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, Francis.","Operator","And this concludes the question-and-answer session.

Flatley","Thanks, Rebecca and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019m very pleased to report that Q4 was another record quarter which closed out arguably the most impressive annual performance in the history of the company. Revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $512 million, our 13th quarter of sequential revenue growth. Equally impressive was the leverage we delivered this quarter, as non-GAAP earnings per share grew 93% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.","These record results were due to strong underlying trends across our customer segments and sequencing portfolio, solid operational execution, and a greater than anticipated tax benefit. Fourth-quarter total sequencing revenue grew 48% year-over-year, driven by demand across our platforms, record consumables and continued uptake of our products across market segments, applications, and experimental scales. Sequencing instrument revenue grew 93% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by demand for the NextSeq 500 and the HiSeq X instruments.","In addition, HiSeq and MiSeq again exceeded our projections, as customers continue to view these instruments as the NGS gold standard in their respective segments. As we shared at the JPMorgan conference, in Q4, we added three new HiSeq X Ten customers and booked a total of 37 systems. We now have 18 customers who have ordered 201 systems, 134 of which shipped in 2014. As predicted, Q4 saw noticeably fewer X shipments due to the timing of customer readiness.","Going forward, our order funnel remains healthy, a trend that we project will continue into 2015. We recently announced new additions to our portfolio, which now includes HiSeq X Five, as well as the HiSeq 3000 and 4000. Early customer feedback has further fueled our excitement around this expanded family of high throughput sequencers, which we believe offer tremendous flexibility to address various budgets and scientific priorities. We expect many labs will have multiple versions of our instruments and use them to meet different output, time, and economic drivers.","The introduction of X Five, which will ship in Q2, allows adoption of whole genome sequencing with a lower capital investment and an attractive price per genome. The introduction of this configuration was not prompted by a lack of demand for the HiSeq X Ten. Instead, it's clear that providing a lower entry price to the X technology will grow the overall market more quickly and accelerate the evolution to sequencing full genomes.","The HiSeq family has a rich development road map, including the enablement of patterned flow cell technology, with the introduction of the HiSeq 3000 and 4000. Going forward, we believe most customers will prefer these new systems over the 2500, given the improved economics and throughput. There will be a number of customers who remain on the 2500, however, due to the use of validated workflows or the importance of access to rapid run mode and longer reads.","The introduction of these systems will further catalyze the replacement cycle of older generation instruments. We estimate that approximately 1,000 HiSeqs in the field cannot run the 1T kits. These systems are strong candidates for replacement over the next three years, as customers evaluate their run cost economic.","During Q4, demand for HiSeq 2500 exceeded our expectations. Shipments in the quarter were similar to the levels seen in Q4 2013, and in the Americas, orders reach the highest level seen in the past two years. To ensure customer satisfaction, we are offering a special promotional trade-in progra to labs that received 2500s in Q4. As a result, we deferred a small amount of revenue to account for this program, which will be recognized over the first half of 2015.","Moving to NextSeq, sequential order trends remain strong, with approximately 15% sequential growth in Q4. Incoming orders continued to be fueled by the over 25,000 new leads we generated from the road show conducted shortly after the product launch. These leads contributed to an acceleration of adoption by customers in the fourth quarter and accounted for close to one-half of all orders, up from the 30% we saw in the third quarter.","NextSeq continues to draw significant interest from the oncology market. In the fourth quarter, shipments to this segment grew 50% sequentially and included a multi-unit order for a reference laboratory that is scaled to production level, boding well for future consumable utilization.","The first half of 2015 will see two enhancements to this platform, with the availability of the v2 chemistry, as well as the launch of the NextSeq 550. The v2 chemistry vastly improves error rates, now consistent with our more mature platforms. As a result of this improved performance, the machine is now sufficiently locked down to prepare for open platform clearance, which we expect later this year or early 2016. Available in Q2, the NextSeq 550 further enhances the platform's flexibility, adding the capability to scan v chips.","Initially, we've qualified our cyto and karyomapping arrays and will decide whether to enable other arrays based on market feedback. This functionality is particularly important in reproductive health, as it provides access to our array and sequencing technology with a single CapEx investment. We're very pleased with the roll out of the NextSeq platform, overall, and believe demand for this instrument will be enhanced with these new improvements.","MiSeq continues to outperform our expectations. Orders and shipments both exceeded 300 units in the fourth quarter, the highest level seen since the launch in 2012. New to Illumina sequencing customers drove this outperformance and accounted for more than 60% of orders. Record orders for the MiSeqDx were generated from customers interested in clinical markets, including HLA and cystic fibrosis testing.","Additionally in the first quarter, we will enable v3 chemistry on the MiSeqDx in RUO mode and plan to update the intended use to support FFPE samples. Our competitive position in this market strengthened throughout 2014, which we believe will continue with the introduction of our HLA and forensic sampling answer solutions. Moving to arrays, we continue to witness growth in sample volumes, but at lower prices.","In 2014 volumes grew 5% compared to the prior year, but due to aggressive pricing, total microarray revenue was down 6% for the full year, including a decline of 11% in Q4. Despite this reduction in revenue, our Ag, IVF, and biobanking activities have been strong. In 2014, large volume opportunities in both crops and livestock resulted in approximately 2 million samples shipped to high-throughput breeding operations, a 47% increase versus the prior. We will continue to focus on arrays as a critical component of our Ag business and expect sample shipment growth to exceed 25% in 2015. The IVF market also continues to gain traction.","This business is now approaching $30 million in annual revenue, with a growth of 36% year-over-year. We also remain focused on biobanking activities, and as a result, introduced our MEGA array in the fourth quarter, which provides an improved understanding of diseases and phenotypes across diverse global populations. We believe this product will provide us with a superior competitive positioning in the biobanking market.","As an example of our long-term commitment to arrays, we plan to increase our R&D investment in 2015, expand our concierge service for custom products, and broaden our commercial activities. As a result of these additional investments, we are projecting array revenue to be approximately flat in 2015.","We remain focused on delivering complete sample-to-answer workflows to enable new markets. This strategy includes offering such as NeoPrep and our HLA product, both of which are expected to ship this quarter. The strategy also extends to our forensics genomic system, which is now shipping. With a single workflow, this system enables labs to perform a more robust analysis of a broader range of genetic markers than with existing technologies.","Overall, our market opportunities continue to broaden as demonstrated by commercial, nonprofit, and hospital customers accounting for approximately 55% of shipments in both the fourth quarter in 2015 overall. This year, we made great progress on our strategy to enable clinical markets, as 30% of our instruments went to clinical laboratories. Additionally, sales to the oncology market for both research and clinical applications grew 40% compared to the prior year quarter.","In 2015, we hope to further catalyze this market with programs such as our recently announced Actionable Genome Consortium and our development program in liquid biopsies. Liquid biopsies are expected to play a role across multiple segments of the oncology market. We are focused on first delivering an RUO kit into the market and expect to be in a position to present clinical utility data by year-end.","We will run this test at Illumina's Redwood City CLIA lab to refine the product and develop data for FDA submission. Similar to NIPT, our strategy here is to provide the best technology into the market, as opposed to offering long-term lab tests or selling to physicians.","Moving now to reproductive and genetic health, the market continues to develop on a global scale, which resulted in 47% revenue growth in 2014 compared to the prior year, with NIPT samples growing 31% sequentially in the fourth quarter. As we mentioned last quarter, we recently undertook an assessment of our entire regulatory strategy, which was led by our Myraqa team. We're working with the FDA to determine the appropriate claims and data sets to broaden this market to include the average risk population. We will share more detailed schedule information, once we align with the FDA.","In Q2 we will launch our new NIPT assay which we believe will enable broader adoption of prenatal testing in global markets. Based on paired-end sequencing, this assay is ideally suited for decentralizing NIPT, due to its ability to sequence 48 samples per run and a significant work flow and cost benefits derived by eliminating PCR.","With the development of this new assay, we are moving forward with what we believe to be a superior regulatory strategy; this includes gaining CE IVD marking for the HiSeq software in Europe. Additionally, we plan to gain a CE Mark on a VeriSeq NIPT assay and the associated software, which will enable us to distribute this product as an IVD across the EU. The step that we believe is necessary to develop and penetrate this large market opportunity. As a result of these strategy changes, as well as recent enhancements we\u2019ve made to the HiSeq family of products, we decided to suspend our efforts to seek FDA approval of the HiSeq 2500 in the U.S.","In summary, our Q4 and 2014 results exceeded our expectations and our momentum remains strong as we enter 2015. Our new product introductions will continue to fuels the high throughput market, further enabling customers to tailor their fleet of instruments to meet diverse requirements. With the most powerful and well positioned sequencing portfolio available, our technology leadership is delivering robust demand and an expansion into new markets. Our focus on innovation is stronger than ever and looking ahead we expect to deliver significant shareholder value as we unlock the power of the genome.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of he fourth quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley","Thanks Jay. As Jay described, Q4 marked another solid performance for Illumina to close our record year. Revenue grew 31% in 2014 versus the prior year to $1.86 billion reflecting the impact of the new HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq instruments as well as lower than expected cannibalization of MiSeq and HiSeq.","Reported fourth quarter revenue grew 32% year-over-year to approximately $512 million. This strong result can be attributed once again to record sequencing instruments and consumables. The combined impact of unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations as well as deferral of revenue related to our HiSeq 2500 trade-in program for instruments shipped in Q4, resulted in a $15 million headwind.","Global interest in our products remained strong during the fourth quarter. Shipments in the Americas grew 34% year-over-year and European shipments increased 33% over the same period. In APAC, shipments grew 8% year-over-year as strength in China was partially offset by a decline in Japan as funding discernments remained constrained in the region.","Instrument revenue grew 75% year-over-year to reach $156 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily driven by demand for NextSeq and HiSeqs X Ten, as well as strong MiSeq unit shipments and stable HiSeqs sales. Overall consumable revenue in the quarter was $290 million an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, as higher demand for sequencing consumables was partially offset by a decline in arrays.","Consumable revenue represented 57% of total revenue, modestly higher than the 54% we saw in Q3, but down from 63% in the prior-year period. This decrease year-over-year was due to the strength in sequencing instruments during the quarter. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 32% over Q4 last year, due to our larger installed base of instruments, including the addition of HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq, and reached record levels during the fourth quarter.","Shipments of our Sample Prep products benefited from the price reduction we put in place in Q3, which was more than offset by increased volumes, as customer demand for our core DNA and RNA library prep products grew. MiSeq consumable pull-through remained within our projected range of $40, 000 to $45,000. HiSeq pull-through per instrument excluding HiSeqs X was roughly flat sequentially and comfortably in our projected range.","In future quarters, pull-through for HiSeqs 2500, 3000 and 4000 will be reported as a family of instruments and we continue to project a range of $300,000 to $350,000. In the fourth quarter, consumable utilization for NextSeq and HiSeq X Ten was above our forward-looking guidance ranges that we provided on January 12. This is a function of how we calculate pull-through, which generally results in artificially high number in the first year of launch due to the ramp in the installed base.","As a reminder, we are projecting $80,000 to $100,000 of annual consumable on NextSeq, and on HiSeqs X, including X Ten and X Five combined, we are expecting to generate $600,000 to $650,000 per year of reagent utilization per instrument. Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts, and revenue from NIPT services, grew 22% versus Q4 2013 to $62 million.","This improvement was driven by growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base; NIPT services, which benefited from test fees, as well as increased test send-out revenue; and strength in genotyping services. Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude legal contingencies, non-cash stock compensation expense, and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release. ","Before I talk about the trends for the quarter, I would like to highlight the GAAP treatment of two significant transactions that we are pleased to have resolved in Q4. Firstly, we settled the Syntrix litigation for an amount less than our prior accrual, resulting in an accounting gain $109 million, $27 million of which was recorded in cost of revenue, and $82 million of which was recorded in operating expense.","In addition, we recorded a $30 million intangible asset, reflecting the future benefit of the license acquired. Secondly, we entered into an agreement with Sequenom, resulting in, among other elements, the pulling of our patents. As a result of this transaction, we recorded $49 million of legal contingencies costs in research and development expenses, reflecting the upfront payments we made to Sequenom.","Both of these items have been excluded from our non-GAAP results. Turning now to margins, our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter equaled 72.3% compared to 73.2% in the third quarter. The sequential decline is due to the impact of deferred revenue and other items associated with the new product introductions, partially offset by the higher mix of consumables.","Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins expanded 90 basis points from 71.4% to 72.3% as the lower mix of consumables was more than offset by improved instrument margins and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally GAAP gross margin expanded to 820 basis points versus the prior year to equal 75.1%, primarily due to the aforementioned gain on the Syntrix litigation. Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $80 million, or 15.7% of revenue compared to $70 million or 14.6% of revenue in the third quarter.","The sequential increase in R&D expense was primarily due to headcount additions and other expenses related to our new products. On a GAAP basis the increase in research and development expenses to a $143 million compared to $85 million in Q3 was primarily due to the upfront Sequenom payment previously mentioned. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $97 million, or 18.9% of revenue, compared to $91 million or 19% of revenue in the previous quarter.","The sequential increase in expense was primarily due to commission payments arising from the excellent year-end performance and higher headcount to support our revenue growth. Adjusted operating margins were 37.7% compared to 39.7% in the third quarter. A decrease sequentially due to lower gross margins and increased investment. Operating margin was higher compared to the 32.3% we reported in the fourth quarter of last year due to the impact of improved gross margins and operating expense leverage.","In the fourth quarter we recognized approximately 700k of adjusted other expense, primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange. During the quarter our stock-based compensation was $38 million lower than the $45 million reported in Q3, which was elevated as a result of additional accrued expense for our performance stock units.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 16.2% compared to 32.6% in the fourth quarter of last year, lower primarily due to the full-year impact of the R&D tax credit and other tax extenders which were enacted in the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter rate was significantly better than we expected at the time of our recent pre-announcement, as we benefited from favorable adjustments related to multiple prior-year provisions and higher-than-expected stock deductions.","These favorable items, which surfaced in the last few weeks as part of our normal quarter and year-end close process, equated to approximately $0.06 of EPS improvement. Excluding the impact of these items to Q4 non-GAAP tax rate would have equaled 22%, and for the full-year, our normalized tax rate would have been 28.2%, which excludes also the favorable tax item we noted in Q3.","Non-GAAP net income was $129 million for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS was $0.87. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $65 million and $0.25 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2013. We reported GAAP net income of $153 million or $1.03 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $81 million or $0.56 per diluted share in the prior year period.","Current-period results include the aforementioned Syntrix litigation gain, which was offset in part by the Sequenom expense item and their associated tax impacts. We generated cash flow from operations of $141 million in the fourth quarter even after the outflow of $51 million due to the Syntrix settlements, Sequenom agreement. For the full year cash flow from ops was $501 million, a new record. Q4 DSO was 51-days, a slight improvement from the 52-days seen in the prior quarter.","Capital expenditures in Q4 were $35 million, resulting an $106 million of free cash flow. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 185,000 shares for $35 million and we have $130 million remaining under our previously announced programs. We ended the quarter with over $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Turning now to our expectations for 2015, we are projecting approximately 20% total Company revenue growth and non-GAAP EPS was $3.12 to $3.18. This guidance assumes current currency rates, which would result in a 200-basis point headwind growth compared to last year. Additionally, we are projecting approximately 73% gross margins full year weighted average non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of $150 million and full year pro-forma tax rate of 28%, which does include the 2015 federal R&D tax credit and other tax extenders.","For modeling purposes, we feel it is appropriate to assume the tax credit is passed Q4, and at the time, we will record the full-year impact. Therefore at this point, we expect the Q1 tax rate of approximately 29%.","In summary, we delivered remarkable fourth quarter results including impressive revenue growth over a strong prior year quarter as well as 93% growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share which capped off an exceptional 2014. This year, we made significant progress on our market development strategies and we look forward to pushing these investments even further in 2015. We believe our strategy of technology leadership and market enablement will catalyze the adoption of genomics and enable us to address the more than $20 billion market opportunity we have ahead of us.","Thank you for your time, we will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] and your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tycho W. Peterson","Thanks guys. Question about maybe just any thoughts you might have about cannibalization with 3000, 4000 and NextSeq 550, you have obviously done a good job in the past mitigating cannibalization of the current portfolio, but maybe talk to where you see some potential cannibalization for the coming year.","Marc A. Stapley","Yes, I think the 550 will be a purely incremental product and it will be small increment on top of the standard NextSeq base, since it\u2019s really designed to appeal to that set of customers that need to run sequencing together. So that\u2019s not a huge part of the overall market, so we don\u2019t anticipate any direct cannibalization there at all. With respect to the 3000, 4000 as we alluded to in the script, we do think that customers in general will prefer getting on the newer road map, so those who have the ability and the funds to upgrade from or to sort of change out 2500s or who are buying new instruments will likely favor the 3000 and the 4000.","We also price the 3000 version, which is a single flows all version, right on top of the old price of the HiSeq 2500 and that was done intentionally for those customers who may have had grants or tenders in place and would be able to convert the funds that they had allocated for 2500 directly to a 3000. So the net of that is that we do expect significant cannibalization over the next year of the 2500, but sort of a catalyzing effect on the older installed base to trade out the older 2000s and early version of 2500s for the newer technology.","Tycho W. Peterson","And then as we think about the implications of decupling the X Ten with the X Five, you mentioned t","As we think about the implications of decoupling me ask ten with the X Five you mentioned that didn't slowdown demand for X ten, but could you have a better year in orders in with X Five and X Ten combined in 2015 then you did in 2014 or just the extent?","Jay T. Flatley","We certainly could. The reason we did this is because as I mentioned we think we can grow the overall market faster. Demand for X Ten continues and since we made the announcement with X Five recently our assumptions there have been validated, so there is quite a few customers that we\u2019ve talked to who have been in our queue who continue to push forward with X Ten type purchase. So we are pretty confident that most of that pipeline will continue to drive toward X Ten. Some of them who might not have gotten there for quite some time maybe able to jump in now sooner with X Five and then upgrade to a ten unit configuration over time.","So overall we think, we certainly are going to grow the market faster than 2015 would've been on its own we have the potential to grow the overall X unit faster than 2015 than we did in 2014.","Tycho W. Peterson","Okay, if I could ask one last quick one, can you quantify the decline in array pricing that you called out? Are you assuming that [indiscernible] rates? I know you talked about revenues and rate being flat in 2015, but how much of the pricing come down?","Marc A. Stapley","Well, there is certainly a different array in our product line Tycho, I would guess now there is 25 or 30 different array products that we offer. And the prices are so different and the market segments are so different it\u2019s hard for an average to make much sense their. So I actually have that number in my finger tips, but I think that you can expect array pricing to continue to go down over the next few years, particularly as more customers migrate towards sequencing and the business tends to stay on micro arrays will be the less and less complex part of the market. So you'll see for example our high complexity arrays like the 2.5 and the 5 million arrays be a smaller and smaller part of the product line and those are clearly the highest price chips. So you will continue to see the overall ASP and arrays go down.","Tycho W. Peterson","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Douglas Schenkel","Hey guys good afternoon.","Jay T. Flatley","Hi, Doug.","Douglas Schenkel","So you continue to demonstrate the ability to innovate and advance using SBS chemistry as demonstrated by recently announced new products and some of the advancements linked to pair of flow cells and clearly this innovation puts you in a position to generate robust growth. Maybe to levels that exceed what\u2019s in current consensus expectations. All that said, the investment case for material upside from current share levels seems to be largely predicated on not just a large TAM that exist for you guys, but on building confident in your ability to capture that TAM. So when we think about the clinical opportunity what milestones specifically should investors measure you by in 2015 including, but going beyond what you talked about for liquid biopsy in your prepared remarks?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I guess when you think about the that we talked about a year go the $20 billion number, there is a number of key things you ought to watch. They are probably not \u2013 I think milestone perhaps is a little bit of a strong word these are big digital events. But its continued progress in the development of key markets. Certainly in TOP seq I think watching what happens there, we have the Scottish genomes program that we announced just recently, we are yet to understand exactly how those 15 units are going to be used, but early indicators are that program may evolve to be something not too dissimilar from which \u2013 trying to accomplish.","So that would be kind of the number two project we put in the TOP seq program. Clearly what happened in the state of the union address at least alluded to the potential of some precision medicine programs in the US which would be very exciting of course if that one that\u2019s happening.","So I think watching that continued progress particularly with the scale of those projects will be important announcements for investors to watch. In the clinical space, what we're doing with the actual genome panel and the rollout of products there, the additional pharmaceutical Company's that may come into the Consortium I think will be evidence of continued progress. Once we start deploying the actual genome panel into the market and monitoring the uptake of that panel I think will be important data to watch.","Clearly, Liquid biopsy is a breakthrough opportunity for anybody who is working in that area and our goal as I mentioned in the script to get some clinical data, some really important clinical data done by the end of 2015. So I think that will be critical as well.","NIPT I would watch the expansion into Europe and China in particular. The new product we announced there the VeriSeq NIPT is going to be a key ingredient of that expansion tied to the CE marketing we are working on in EU.","Douglas Schenkel","All right, that\u2019s really helpful. And then actually sticking with NIPT, and I am just curious if you could give us little more color on what prompted the alternation in the PMA strategy there. Was it largely a function of the new addition of Morocco, was it a change in regulatory reimbursement or competitive dynamics, whether technical developments such as maybe HiSeq 2500 FDA strategy and I guess in terms of timelines what\u2019s the reasonable expectations for us as we think about getting an update from you.","Jay T. Flatley","I put the strategy change in two general buckets one is product evolution and I will talk specifically about that and the second I call market evolution. So on the technology front what we done with the 3,000 and the 4,000 are very important breakthroughs that we have made over the past calendar year. And we are working on that 2500 submission in parallel with that. Once we got to the point, where we knew we were going to launch the 3000, 4000 configurations.","If you think about where the 2500 would be at the time it would come out of the PMA submission for example 18 months from now which would kind be the timeframe that we had anticipated. That product is going to be pretty long in the tooth and so we thought that its adoption approved or otherwise beginning a year and half from now wouldn\u2019t be high.","The second part that ties to that from a market perspective is that we think the real growth opportunity in the U.S. market isn't so much in the higher risk spaces in the average risk market. And so we were really focused no how do we grow the market to embrace average risk. And to do a submission only on high risk we thought was also limiting.","So therefore, we have been working with FDA to define what we have to do to get an average risk approval and with the breath of that marketplace we think the other assay method that we\u2019ve developed for the second part of the technology evolution the VeriSeq I PDSA is a better technical solution to a broader more diverse market.","And that\u2019s true certainly in Europe and we think by the time we get through PMA application it will be true in the U.S. as well. So those for the underlying factors now of course bringing the Myraqa and gave us the ability of stand back and do a full analysis of our entire regulatory strategy for all products and that could put instrumental and helping us tune this strategy and make some important changes.","Douglas Schenkel","And the second last part of that question which was in terms of timing, is it reasonable think will get more of an update this year give you know a lot of the sounds like it is linked to really uppers that you are making together with the FDA.","Jay T. Flatley","I think it\u2019s reasonable to think that we will have an idea this year about what we need to accomplish. I wouldn't necessarily think it\u2019s reasonable that we would have a submission this year.","Douglas Schenkel","Okay thanks again.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good afternoon.","Jay T. Flatley","Hi, Derik.","Marc A. Stapley","Hi, Derik.","Derik de Bruin","I have two quick question, one just housekeeping question. The stock option expense market was lower than we had projected in Q4 and give some sort of guidance on the 2015 number there?","Marc A. Stapley","Yes, Q4 relative to Q3 I think sequential growth. Yes, Q3 was more normally rather than Q4 and Q3 we had an uptick and expense rate to our performance share plan. Given the outperformance of the company and that was less marked in the fourth quarter. In terms of 2015 we haven\u2019t bifurcated the stock expense from the other expense line item its embedded in our guidance, but its probably not far off in the current fourth quarter rate.","Derik de Bruin","Perfect. And then I mean back on the NIPT market I guess that I believe we're waiting for approval for the China CFDA and when does that happen and I guess some thoughts on using arrays for NIPT.","Marc A. Stapley","Yes the CFDA is a black box, so we don\u2019t have much visibility into when the submission may come out the other end, so you know we are hoping its months ways, not materially longer than that but the fact of the matter is we just don\u2019t know, so we're watching that very closely. With respect to arrays, I would say we continue to believe very strongly that sequencing is a superior methodology for doing NIPT, its much more flexible, you can add tests, we think particularly on the turn around time this new NextSeq method is a one day turn around time on the sequencer, so its extremely efficient, 48 samples in parallel, very cost effective. So we're extremely confident in sequencing being the most important platform for doing NIPT testing.","Derik de Bruin","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Please proceed.","Daniel Arias","Good afternoon guys thanks. Wanted to ask maybe a bigger picture question on sequencing instrumentation. Jay I think a while back you were asked where you made a comment about sequencing installs relative to the numbers PCR systems that they were out there as an installed base. Have you guys broaden the portfolio and started to go after some of these new markets, do you have a bit of an updated view on the total number of sequences that you think could be in the market in say five years?","Jay T. Flatley","Well we could create on here. Nobody has asked me the question recently. I think we used to talk about the capillary number being an 10,000 to 15,000 as one metric to use that you know if you thought about PCR there is about 50,000 research labs worldwide vastly more if you consider all the clinical labs and it rate to find one of those labs without a PCR machine. So the PCR installed base is a pretty high number, many labs has large numbers of PCR machines.","So that\u2019s a very large installed base, I think setting our sights over say a five year timeframe of being in the 10,000 to 15,000 number of NexGen sequencers would be conservative. So we feel like as we continue to broaden the portfolio, diversify market segments as we take the technology into applied markets that the installed base numbers between us and the other suppliers will certainly blow through those ranges in five years.","Daniel Arias","Okay that\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. Marc maybe a question with a bit more of a tangible answer, do the new instruments have any impact on the ability to sort of max out the manufacturing absorption and really catch the gross margin at the top end or should any production changes there would be pretty seamless?","Jay T. Flatley","I think any production changes would be pretty seamless given the type of technology that is inherent in the 3000 and 4000, the X Five is the same as the X Ten instrument obviously. I mean it\u2019s similar to the comments I think I made last quarter that manufacturing capability tends to come in step function, so you build out a new facility and for while it\u2019s under absorbed and then you absorb it and you keep going like that. So I think we are at a pretty stable point right now with the absorption and the new instruments to just help to continue to drive that.","Daniel Arias","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, gentlemen.","Jay T. Flatley","Hi, Ross.","Marc A. Stapley","Hi, Ross.","Ross Muken","I was curious I wanted to just sort of dig out on a couple of big picture events that happened over the last few weeks and just sort of get your thoughts, because it seems like we are kind of building up to where some of the things you\u2019ve been talking about in the clinical market or starting to become more mainstream, so obviously the President of the state of the Union called out the precision medicine initiative.","He kind of highlighted it, but it seems like that to me is kind of a recognition of where the market is going and will have to see what the details, but I'm kind of curious as to what sort of signal you think that sends, and then obviously Roche also large Pharma at JP paid quite a hefty price for someone you likely serve in the oncology space and so it\u2019s sort of is another Pharma kind of recognizing the value of where sequencing is going. How do you sort of think about those things in terms of these markets we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time getting closer sort of kind of a more large scale reality?","Marc A. Stapley","I say 30,000 feet there are clearly very strong signals and probably I would say indicate things happening perhaps even faster than we had anticipated. I\u2019ve talked to a lot of investors about what\u2019s happening in population sequencing, and our expectation over the next few years that there will be a number of countries that jumped into this in a very serious way.","We frankly thought the U.S. was behind in terms of its willingness to consider this. And obviously it is still not an approved project here and there is lots that has to happen to actually figure out what this project is and whether the appropriation gets approved to fund this project. But the signals that are being given and how rapidly they have come I find extraordinarily encouraging and I think validating of the overall value that sequencing can provide in understanding human health and making dramatic improvements in healthcare both in treatment and in economics.","With respect to Pharma, I have been a pessimist over the last five years about Pharma beginning to readopt a sequencing in a large way. Of course they did that 15 or 20 years ago with their very large sequencing labs with prior generation technology and as we all know not much came out of those efforts and my expectation was that Pharma was going to be pretty much in the back room Insofar as large scale sequencing only outsourcing it. When needed on a specific project.","But of course using it in day to day research in their laboratories. What we've seen over the past 18 to 24 months begins to indicate otherwise. We saw decode being purchased by Amgen, we saw Regeneron\u2019s announcement of their plan to sequence 100,000 xonome, we have now seen Roche plan to put their clinical patients through at least what we believe to put those through the foundation medicine method.","So we are beginning to see Phama come into this market in a very robust way and we are beginning to adjust our own expectations. That this maybe a very rich market, Genentech is the other example, so just a recent announcement of Genentech doing sequencing projects with HLI. So obviously very, very important developments and all bodes well for adoption sequencing in the Pharma industry.","Ross Muken","Great. And maybe just on in RTT we [indiscernible] sort of high risk adoption [indiscernible] I think you said in general volumes were up by 30% which seems like sequentially still a very big number. So help us understand where we are in that. And then what are the discussions like that being other is on sort of the average risk population.","Marc A. Stapley","We have to separate it by geographies and talk about NIPT in that way in the US. I would say were the adoption is significant more than 50% now it\u2019s probably not 75%, so its probably in between. Growth continues more labs are jumping into the space. So we continue to build overall volume and momentum in the high-risk group as we talked about average risk is a much larger market even though the ASPs will be lower, the number of samples are dramatically higher. And right now I think that its very clear that this we see evidence that we have presented publicly on the paper we published, that the utility of this method is the same in an average risk population, although the frequency is much less.","And so our conclusion from that and I believe the FDA\u2019s conclusion will be that this test will get used in average and is for that reason that we want to work very closely with them to make sure whatever product we get approved can support with data and evidence and approval. Use of this method in average risk population, we don\u2019t know the timing of that.","And so as I said before we are working with the FDA to understand was that clinical trial need to look like and how bigger the data sets and what type of data we need together, but that\u2019s all well underway. Quite different in other markets I would say in the EU the penetration is vastly less and it various country-to-country in aggregated I would guess where in the 5% range it maybe ever less. China less than that, but huge potential and probably a market that will come on very, very quickly is products get approved in China. I think the average risk market will come on quickly \u2013 very quickly in China and more slowly in the EU.","Ross Muken","That\u2019s super helpful. And thank you again and congrats for Rebecca and guys.","Jay T. Flatley","Thanks Ross.","Marc A. Stapley","Thanks Ross.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda L. Murphy","Question on population sequencing again if I may.","Jay T. Flatley","Sure.","Amanda L. Murphy","Obviously there is a lot of talk about it, but I am just curious you think about the installed-based you have the X Ten and obviously now with the X Five? How do we think about that opportunity in terms of incremental instrument demand? So obviously there is a lot of capacity out there with genomes and clearly a benefit from the consumable side but is there a way to think about population sequencing in terms of incremental demand from the instrument side versus what you have already in the backlog?","Jay T. Flatley","I mean I would say as we go forward particularly if we\u2019re out a year or two that the usage of an X Ten will get a little blurry in terms of what\u2019s really done on a population sequencing basis and what\u2019s done otherwise. Right now we kind of think a population sequencing programs it is one that our sponsor by the government and really directed to understand the diversity of the population and in some countries understanding a reference genome that\u2019s likely underrepresented in the reference works has been done previously and then understanding the variations and there local population and then trying to learn enough about those variations medically to be able to influence what\u2019s happening clinically in that countries.","So that\u2019s kind of how we think about top seek, in the U.S. there is a lots of sales we made of X Ten that are not that, but in other countries there are some that are certainly borrowing sample streams from the clinical work its going on in the country. Garvin being an example. So if you think about that could Garvin become a top seek project in the next five years maybe they will. [Sidras] and other example where were selling and extend and there is the possibly that more into a population sequencing project. So I think the lines are going to get a little bit blurry, but probably in the next too because think of these top seek projects is digitally incremental to what were doing in the base X Ten business.","Amanda L. Murphy","Got it. Okay thanks. And then in terms of the - I guess a follow-up to Tycho\u2019s question earlier on the HiSeq 4000, 3000 demand if you will. So obviously there is a benefit to get into 3000 versus 2500, but have you done enough \u2013 I know it\u2019s early, but enough market research at this point to assess whether the 4000 will drive an incremental product cycle. So obviously if you have a - 3000 vis-a-vis the 2500, but do think that there will be a decent amount of HiSeq 2000s or 2500s that will upgrade to the 4000 given the incremental benefits?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, we're trying to be cautious about the words we use there, because I think I don\u2019t know how you are using the word upgrade and we get that confused a little internally too. Just to be clear to everyone that you can\u2019t take a 2500 and truly upgrade it, the way we think about upgrading an instrument. So essentially you have to buy a new one, but it\u2019s whether the old one gets largely turned off and so that\u2019s kind of a change out, we probably need to come with a better word to describe it.","We do think that will happen and that the 4000 and the 3000 in combination will be a big incentive to that we talked about that bit when we announced the 1T kit that the systems that were capable of doing 1T would cause the older 2000 in the filed to begin to upgrade to the newer versions of the 2500. For those who didn\u2019t do that I think they will skip right over the 2500 and go to at least 3000 if not the 4000. I would say that I don\u2019t think that 3000, 4000 create a new customer segment, so its not a different type of user, its just vastly better economics, its on a new road map with patterned flow cells and newer technologies and so I think to the extent any customer can get the money to get to a 3000 or 4000, they will opt to do it.","Amanda L. Murphy","Have you guys quantified what the sort of one terabase upgrade or a new product cycle was from a hardware perspective, I know you obviously had the software upgrade, but what's the upgrade cycle from sort of 2000 to the new terabase from a hardware perspective. Did you ever quantify that?","Jay T. Flatley","There was only - do you mean in terms of numbers of installed base?","Amanda L. Murphy","Yes, just curious, I know obviously everyone \u2013 if you could get the software upgrade you would, but just in terms of who bought a new 2500 to get the terabase reagent kit vis-\u00e0-vis the old instrument that could impact that?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, we\u2019ve never parsed to those numbers out. I mean there has been a couple of analysts who have made estimates about what fraction of our installed base of 2000s and 2500s could not run the 1T kit and so those estimates have been made, but we\u2019ve never said what that number was.","Amanda L. Murphy","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","William Quirk","Great, thanks good afternoon everybody.","Jay T. Flatley","Hi, Bill.","William Quirk","First question, Jay you mentioned in your prepared comments that\u2019s about 30% I believe it\u2019s the number of the instruments in this quarter two clinical customers and so I'm curious with the new NGS codes that went live in early January, any feedback in terms of I guess the smooth or smoothing or perhaps less than smooth reimbursement that some of these customers are seeing and maybe you can just talk to us a little bit about how you guys are thinking that play out - playing out over the year? Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley","I would say it's a little early for us to have any actual evidence of the impact of the codes, I haven\u2019t our team has not gotten any data yet and are any direct feedback from customers on behavior changes or changes in reimbursement. So we don't really have any data. Obviously we think it's going to be helpful and Palmetto just did an improvable of NGS code as well which we think will be helpful, but it\u2019s too early for us to know what the impact is going to be and whether it\u2019s a direct effect on volumes or usage or sort of lab economics yet.","William Quirk","Got it. And then another one on NIPT off the topic today. If we are thinking about adoptions average risk population, obviously society is endorsing that is going to help out in a pretty meaningful way and estimates kicking around when ACOG much have been in endorsed average risk. Are you guys expecting to see that this year? We have heard dates as soon as perhaps April or May or roughly in conjunction with the annual meeting.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, we\u2019ve heard that as well, we are not counting on that, so I would say our internal plan indicate or assume that it would likely happen sometime in 2016 not in 2015. Having said that it\u2019s possible that I could come earlier. We were surprised when ACOG adopted the high risk test earlier than we expected. So conservative and to the curve, but that's the safe place for us to be in terms of our own internal modeling, so we are assuming sometime in 2016.","William Quirk","Got it. Thanks guys.","Marc A. Stapley","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Please proceed.","Daniel Leonard","Great, thank you. What\u2019s your assessment of the IP landscape and liquid biopsy and is IP the meaningful factors as you think about getting the product there?","Jay T. Flatley","I think it\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen so far much more straightforward IP landscape than what we seen in the lot of other markets particularly in NIPT, clearly there will be companies when claim they have some fundamental IP around this as happens almost in every application area. I think when it all get sorted out these assay methods are pretty standard, there is not a lot of raw invention in the assay method just being used to sequence blood in a slightly different way. So we think it\u2019s a relatively open field from an intellectual property perspective.","Daniel Leonard","Got it, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro","Thanks, just one follow-up on liquid biopsy looking past the NIPT, also curious, how you are looking at the competitive landscape. As we look at the companies that have self identified in this market, there are few that seem to be more or less piggybacking on their own NGS technology and there are few others that have been sort of a proprietary chemistry. So did you feel that you have most of the assets you need to be successful on the go standalone basis in liquid biopsy?","Jay T. Flatley","And I mean, first half I would say we are not planning to do kind of standalone basis. Many of the companies that have announced projects and begin to show some clinical data in a NIPT, most them use sequencing as their underlying method, there are few other alternatives. But most of them use sequencing. And most of them use our platform and we will continue to encourage that, those are going to be great customers for us because remember in the US even though we are developing our own method.","We don\u2019t have the ability to go out to the labs and to teach those labs how to use that method because home [indiscernible]. So in the US we will go through the FDA and try to get an improved test, we will run an LDTS necessary to gather data to sort of build clinical evidence and encourage the overall market to grow with lots of different methods here. It\u2019s going to be a diverse set of methods that we believe for NIPT that is for local biopsy. There is a number of different ways to go about it, there will be some companies which use to have very targeted tests that have limited indications. There will be others that go after much more universal methods. Our option that we have chosen is to go toward the more universal test, even though we march through some more targeted collections of variants on the way.","Isaac Ro","Got, it, that makes sense, thanks. And just on the forensic platform, that\u2019s a market where you know I think on the customers either government funded or crime labs and the like so just maybe if you could help us understand your go-to market strategy there, your initial target customers are kind of channel investments that you make much.","Jay T. Flatley","So, you\u2019re right. Our approach actually from a commercial perspective is to take what we believe is a significant superior offering in this market through our specialist channel that overlays on our sales force and targets exactly the kind of labs that you were talking about. So we made the announcement couple of weeks ago and we expect to be out in the field, this quarter and through the rest of the year targeting those labs.","Isaac Ro","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw. Please proceed.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions.","Jay T. Flatley","Thanks.","Steve Beuchaw","I want to Jay if you could you take the approach that you have been using in NIPT with the review that Myraqa has given and maybe give us that same lengths on your approaching in clinical and oncology. What is your \u2013 you are work with Myraqa you know thought you about how do approach that market.","Jay T. Flatley","I said a couple of things one is that will be going for C approval in Europe faster than we might have otherwise that\u2019s a critical step for us to take and is one that that\u2019s the easier to take then FDA approval. So you will us do that much more aggressively then perhaps we done historically. The second thing I think you will see us a bit shift as will go for in the U.S. for open platform approval first and that will allow others to put their assay methods on our platform before we get a specific assay method of own approve. So those are strategic changes I think that came out of the review my Myraqa that apply across the board.","Look we are really excited the work \u2013 about the work going on the Actionable Genome Consortium in terms of setting the standards for the sample and target perhaps for the sample and target perhaps for the reporting the informatics and we have regulatory volumes that are shooting as interest observes in the AGC process and are looking at what that AGC will publish we like the way that process is playing out an expect us to continue to do more of that kind of activity.","Steve Beuchaw","I should put it all together I mean how do you think about the growth in the oncology business forward from a very 2014.","Jay T. Flatley","While we are quite optimistic about and think even without Actionable Genome and liquid biopsy our core oncology business is growing very nicely you were at least the corporate if not a bit higher. So I think they are continuous to be very strong demand if you look at the fraction of NextSeq oncology tie and as I think there is a general into these types of applications increasing broad them so it\u2019s not just a big cancer centers anymore. And then you layer on top of that the step functions we think we could provide with the Actionable Genome panel and with successful liquid biopsy product I think that puts inflection points in the curve, but those inflection points are still aways that.","Steve Beuchaw","Perfect, thank so much everyone.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert. Please proceed.","Jeffrey T. Elliott","Yes, thanks for the question. Jay, since its been about a year since you launched the X Ten, can you reflect on the experience your customers have had and things like gathering sample prep, managing the data and then as a follow-on any change in thought on opening of two other samples besides the whole human genomes?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I think there is a couple of observations there, one that we\u2019ve highlighted previously that clearly we're selling this technology much more broadly than our original assumptions and as a result of that we have a greater fraction of our customers of X Tens that need to bring up new capabilities that perhaps they didn\u2019t have before. Its one thing if you are the bro and you know how to sequence massive number of samples and you have pipelines in place, informatics in place and 400, 000 samples in the freezer that\u2019s sort of one extreme and clearly they came up to speed on X Ten extraordinarily fast, but there are lots of other customers that need to build out brand new sample prep pipelines and that takes some time.","Informatics is a challenge and part is a challenge for everybody even including a bro to be able to analyze the vast number of samples that can be created by the X Ten, but clearly no one would work on that probably unless we had the X Ten in the market. So it\u2019s very important that we deliver this technology and that\u2019s really catalyzing the world to begin to work on the problems of how you analyze tens of thousands of whole genomes at one time. So the informatics will keep up, although it tends to lag and there is always a concern reflect back that when we launched our first 300k genotyping chip, everybody was still worried about the challenge of analyzing all that data and now that\u2019s a pittance compared to what we can do an X Ten.","So that counts I think for the spectrum of adoptions rates or usage rates on the X Ten, so if we do have the ability now to analyze internally what fraction of the time each of these instruments is used by the X Ten customers and that falls across a very broad spectrum and its for the exact reasons that we\u2019ve just discussed. I\u2019m sorry your second parts of the question.","Jeffrey T. Elliott","The applications opening further.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, so right now we have no plan to open the applications, today you should think of X technology as being whole human genome, you know at some point in the future we may reconsider that decision, but as of today it\u2019s a whole genome sequencing box.","Jeffrey T. Elliott","Good. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Maxim Group. Please proceed.","Bryan Brokmeier","Hi thanks for taking the questions. You previously alluded to a pace of PMA submissions that the FDA has never seen before from the entire market has a whole. Have you had discussions with the FDA and what are sort of their feedback been on your plans and their ability to handle it?","Jay T. Flatley","I\u2019m sorry; I don\u2019t understand the first part of that. That was the sheer number of PMAs that the FDA deals with?","Bryan Brokmeier","Yes, talk about \u2013 I don\u2019t know a few quarters ago you talked about the FDA and they usually only approved two or three PMAs per year and you are planning to bring more submissions to them than they have seen in the entire market. So I was wondering what \u2013 if they have had any feedback on their ability to handle that.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be constraint at the FDA, the data sets that we're providing here, I think they know how to review them procedurally, so I don\u2019t think there is necessarily a challenge around that. I think the bigger challenge here is the intellectually everyone is making to a new generation of approved product. One where there is not a one-to-one correlation anymore between what comes in and what possible result you could conclude from the data set and that\u2019s the big leap that needs to be made and where we and the FDA need to work together to figure out how do you actually validate these new products. They truly are a different class and have never been approved before, and I think getting over that hurdle and understanding and perhaps evolving whatever we decide to do collectively there is where the big challenge is as appose to just handling the sheer number of submissions.","Bryan Brokmeier","Good. Thanks Jay and I think the second question for Marc. Gross margins have recently benefited by the higher margins in the instruments you have introduced in the last year. Are the margins on the instruments you just recently announced have similar levels as the instruments last year and what impact will the trade-in program that you talked about today have on gross margins?","Marc A. Stapley","Well the impact of the trade-in program, you have seen marginally in the fourth quarter, and we\u2019ll unwind through Q1 and Q2 as our program wraps up in the first half. On the new instruments, I would think those as being similar gross margins to the instruments that we currently have, but the exception is obviously the X Five is a higher price per unit than the X Ten, so obviously there is a slightly better gross margin on X Five.","Bryan Brokmeier","Okay. Thanks a lot.","End of Q&A","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Rebecca Chambers for any closing remarks.","Rebecca Chambers","Thank you.

Good afternoon everyone. Illumina had another strong quarter with record revenue of $853 million, up 20% from the third quarter of 2017. We saw continued momentum across both our sequencing and microarray business, including strong demand for sequencing consumables to support research, translational, and clinical applications across a broad range of customers.","In the third quarter of 2018, sequencing consumable revenue of $467 million grew 23% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and included about $14 million of stocking associated with Chinese customers buying ahead of potential tariffs.","Year-over-year revenue growth of $87 million reflected growth across our high throughput, mid throughput and low throughput categories as Illumina continues to uniquely support the broadest range of customer applications and throughput requirements.","Within the high throughput family, HiSeq consumables continued their expected and steady decline as customers transition to NovaSeq. While HiSeq still represents the majority of high throughput consumable revenue today, NovaSeq continues to grow very quickly with S4 representing the largest revenue contributor across the entire high throughput family of flow cells. That said, we continue to see a good mix of demand across the NovaSeq portfolio that also includes the lower output S2 and S1 flow cells.","Consumables for our mid throughput sequencing system, NextSeq, continue to perform extremely well with many customers adopting the system as their primary workhorse for NIPT and oncology applications. As a result, NextSeq pull-through per system was at the high end of the $100,000 to $150,000 per year range.","And the low throughput family also grew well with pull-through for both MiSeq and MiniSeq within their respective ranges. Sequencing consumable revenue also benefited from a modest contribution associated with iSeq, in its first full quarter of commercial availability.","Finally, library prep also contributed to year-over-year growth with our Nextera suite of products leading the way. We believe our continued focus on delivering differentiated solutions that simplify customer workflows and improve data quality and costs will drive growth in library prep revenue. For example, we launched Nextera Flex in Richmond, a few weeks ago, which we believe will set a new standard for fast turnaround time, coverage uniformity, and content flexibility for exome sequencing. In total, sequencing consumables represented 55% of revenue in the third quarter consistent with last quarter and up 2% from the same quarter a year ago.","Moving to sequencing systems, revenue of $138 million was up 12% sequentially with solid performance within the portfolio. As we expected, this was the strongest quarter of the year so far, and in fact, the highest revenue quarter for sequencing system since the fourth quarter of 2015.","Consistent with our expectation for a heavily backend loaded year; NovaSeq delivered its highest revenue contribution of the year with stable ASP trends. Everything we're seeing is consistent with our belief that the NovaSeq upgrade cycle will span multiple years and we continue to target 330 to 350 NovaSeq shipments for the full year.","NextSeq shipments grew sequentially and year-over-year with a good mix of existing and new to sequencing customers. Within our low throughput system family both MiSeq and MiniSeq shipments were up sequentially with good activity across all our regions and strong adoption by new to sequencing customers, who again, represented over 50% of shipments in the third quarter.","iSeq got off to a great start with demand from both existing and new Illumina customers and shipments ahead of forecast. We're hearing great feedback from customers on how easy the iSeq is to use and how it's increasing productivity of labs that can now afford to in-source lower throughput projects.","Sequencing services and other revenue of $109 million was up 36% from the same quarter a year ago and roughly flat on a sequential basis as we expected. In total, our sequencing revenue grew 21% in the third quarter of 2018 with strong activity across research, translational, and clinical applications.","Across these areas we continue to be encouraged by a myriad of developments that we believe will enable genomics to continue the progression from research to the clinic and over time the standard-of-care. We're optimistic about genomics-based research funding as our technologies have uncovered insights that have been used to improve patients\u2019 lives, especially in cancer.","One notable area where we see significant potential is immunotherapy. With over 1,000 clinical studies associated with I\/O there's overwhelming interest in using the immune system to combat cancer. But the biomarkers used today to predict responses of class of drugs fail to fully classify patients that will benefit from treatment.","One example of our commitment to this area is a recently initiated collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to identify genomic biomarkers that predict response to immunotherapy using whole exome and whole genome sequencing. In addition to our collaboration with BMS on tumor mutational burden, we believe that these studies will provide insights to help stratify patients for the most suitable and impactful therapies and therapy combinations.","At a high level, the funding environment for basic and translational research continues to look favorable. In the U.S., for example, we were pleased to see that the total NIH budget for 2019 is increasing $2 billion to $39 billion. Genomics and NGS research continue to be areas of focus, especially in areas like oncology, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases, to name a few.","Population genomics initiatives continue to build momentum in the third quarter. [All of us] [ph] selected three genome centers to begin generating genomic data within the next quarter. And the Healthy Nevada Project announced that its third phase will include more than 250,000 participants, building on the 50,000 participants currently in the program's first two phases.","Yale launched a project to sequence 100,000 exomes starting in early 2019 and the U.K.'s National Health Service announced interest in sequencing up to 5 million whole genomes in the next five years. These large scale population studies represent a unique opportunity to better understand genomics, health, and disease and we remain in the earliest stages of rollout.","Of particular interest this quarter, Bangladesh launched a cancer-focused Precision Medicine Initiative that will utilize both our sequencing and array technologies. This is notable as it shows precision medicine and associated population genomics initiatives are extending their reach into developing countries.","In NIPT, we have submitted four new IDD applications to extend the geographic opportunity for our VeriSeq NIPT product. In the U.S., we continue to see growing average-risk coverage with recent decisions from Florida and Minnesota Medicaid, Blue Cross Blue Shield Tennessee in North Carolina, bringing total average risk coverage to 43%.","In RUGD, Rady Children's Hospital here in San Diego received funding from Medi-Cal to launch Project Baby Bear, offering clinical whole-genome sequencing as a first-line diagnostic test for babies in the NICU. This is a strong validation of the value and potential for sequencing to improve the management of babies born with a rare and undiagnosed disease and we applaud the state of California for funding this effort.","Further supporting the value of whole genome sequencing for many RUGD patients, CMS released final pricing of about $5,000 for a single genome late last week. This CMS decision is another important milestone to support the progression of clinical whole genomes into standard-of-care for RUGD patients over time.","Finally, on the reimbursement front, we continue to see the development of a more supportive landscape that we believe will accelerate the adoption of genomics in the clinic and encourage further innovation in the field.","Most recently, Anthem with more than 27 million covered lives, announced that it will reimburse large NGS panels for stage four patients or those with their current metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Of note, covered panels will be required to include tumor mutational burden, highlighting what we believe could be an emerging trend in panel coverage.","Moving to arrays, total microarray revenue of $134 million was down sequentially as expected and up 11% from the third quarter of 2017. Array instrument revenue of $16 million was higher than we expected and the largest revenue contribution since 2011, driven by a large key DTC customer scaling ahead of anticipated holiday demand.","This was more than offset by lower microarray service and other revenue on a sequential basis. While there is seasonality, we continue to be impressed with the rate of growth we're seeing among our DTC customers.","Consumer genomics has predominantly been a U.S. phenomenon until now, so it was particularly exciting to see a healthy revenue contribution associated with an emerging consumer genomics industry in Asia-Pacific in the third quarter.","Moving to regional results, Americas\u2019 revenue grew 14% versus the prior year period, driven by growth across the sequencing business. EMEA delivered another strong quarter with 33% growth from the prior year period, including a strong contribution from Genomics England, which has now sequenced more than 87,000 whole genomes. Other growth drivers included NovaSeq, NIPT, and sequencing consumables more broadly, which combined, more than offset a negative year-over-year FX impact.","Greater China grew 17% year-over-year, with strong sequencing consumable growth. During the quarter, MiSeqDx received NMPA approval, our first NGS instrument to receive regulatory clearance in the region and a significant milestone for Illumina as we expand our clinical presence in the growing Chinese market. This timing, given the emergence of targeted therapies and signs of a more supportive Chinese regulatory environment with two PD-1 drug approvals in the past few months.","Finally, APJ revenue of $58 million was up 29% from the third quarter of 2017, the strongest quarter in the region since early 2014. Our APJ business is benefiting from strong sequencing activity among regional, commercial sequencing service providers that drove a majority of the year-over-year revenue growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sam for a review of our quarterly financials. Sam?","Sam Samad","Thanks Francis. As discussed, third quarter revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $853 million, driven by 21% growth in sequencing and 11% growth in microarrays. Consumables and services continue to represent the majority of total revenue, representing 64% and 17% respectively or 81% in total.","Consumable revenue was $550 million, up 2% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. Services and other revenue was $143 million, down 9% sequentially and up 21% year-over-year.","In the third quarter, our sequencing consumable business once again benefited from a handful of Chinese customers buying ahead of anticipated tariffs. In the second quarter, we noted that $13 million of revenue has accelerated into Q2 due to tariffs. In the third quarter, an additional $14 million of tariff-related purchases was accelerated.","Moving to systems, total instrument revenue was $154 million, up 21% sequentially and up 10% year-over-year with a strong performance within our system families. Instrument revenue, therefore, represented 18% of total revenue in the quarter.","Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 71.1% was higher than expected and increased 80 basis points compared to the second quarter, driven by favorable product mix within sequencing consumables.","Year-over-year, non-GAAP gross margin increased 230 basis points, primarily due to a higher mix of sequencing consumables. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $356 million were up $8 million from last quarter, largely reflecting higher R&D investments and headcount additions. Non-GAAP operating margin was therefore 29.4%, up from 28.4% last quarter. Excluding Helix, operating margin was 32% compared to 30.6% last quarter.","The non-GAAP tax rate of 17.3% was higher on a sequential basis from the 15.9% last quarter due to the incremental investment in Helix creating additional tax benefits in Q2. While it was lower than we expected due to favorable prior year return adjustments recorded this quarter.","For the third quarter of 2018, GAAP net income was $199 million or $1.33 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $227 million or $1.52 per diluted share. Cash flow from operations was $292 million.","DSO of 46 days was higher compared to 43 days last quarter, driven by less favorable revenue linearity. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $64 million and Q3 free cash flow was $228 million.","This quarter, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due 2023. Net proceeds of the issuance were $735 million, of which $103 million was used to repurchase shares.","Additionally, our 2019 and 2021 notes became convertible from October 1 to December 31, 2018. We therefore ended the quarter with approximately $3.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.","As a result of the 2019 and 2021 notes becoming convertible, approximately 1 million shares have been added to our Q3 diluted share count and weighted average share count for the quarter was 149 million.","Moving to guidance, we continue to expect full year 2018 revenue to grow approximately 20%. We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be up modestly from 2017 and we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.32 to $5.37 and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $5.70 to $5.75.","In the fourth quarter specifically, we expect revenue to be flat to slightly up from the third quarter of 2018. We expect sequencing system revenue to be up sequentially. We expect sequencing consumables to be down sequentially, reflecting the approximately $20 million of consumable revenue previously forecasted for the fourth quarter that has already shipped to Chinese customers in Q2 and Q3.","And we expect microarrays to be down slightly with growth in consumables more than offset by an expected decline in microarray instruments. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be at its lowest level of the year due to higher system and arrays mix expected in the fourth quarter.","We expect non-GAAP operating expenses on a percent of revenue basis to be up meaningfully from the third quarter and we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.17 to $1.22 and non-GAAP earnings per share to be $1.30 to $1.35.","With that, we'll open up the queue -- the call to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the questions-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","The first question in the queue comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. You may begin sir.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon guys and congrats. Maybe starting on NovaSeq, helpful with all the color. It seems like a tremendous quarter. It feels like the breadth of application use is continuing to increase and interest in a lot of the clinical states, whether it's rare disease or liquid biopsy, et cetera, are growing. And so maybe can you just provide -- it seems like the -- provide a little color on sort of the types of customers and some of these new to sequencing or new to high-throughput customers that you're seeing because it feels like we're seeing kind of a changing of the guard in terms of the names of organizations or the types of firms that are now looking to acquire high throughput sequencer and sort of what they're doing with it. So, a little color around that.","And then as it relates to kind of the Q4 guidance, just sort of the pushes and pulls where you see maybe the most amount of conservatism or the biggest risk within sort of those assumptions.","And Sam, I thought the incremental color was helpful. I just want to make sure I know where the kind of key inflection points are, if it's NovaSeq or if it's one of the other pieces.","Francis deSouza","Sure and thank you, Ross. So, in terms of the NovaSeq, and we said this on previous calls and it's more true today than ever, we are very pleased with the strong interest we're continuing to see in NovaSeq. And we're really pleased with the way this upgrade cycle is playing out. We have planned this to be a multiyear upgrade cycle. And we planned the stage activation of the different parts of the HiSeq base through the use of different flow cells.","And frankly, we're really happy with the way it's playing out. We talked about the fact that we continue to see growth from, as you pointed out, a segment of new to high throughput, new to sequencing customers that, frankly, was higher than we expected coming into the NovaSeq upgrade cycle and so we've typically seen between a quarter and a third now NovaSeq customers each quarter being in that new to sequencing, new to high throughput base.","And as we look to the base, we are seeing, as you pointed out, some of these customers are not the usual suspects. They are new to sequencing and I'll give you some examples. An example of a customer we got in the last quarter included a new hospital customer that's part of a national collaboration in a European country to move towards clinical whole genome sequencing and is linked with a PMI project in that country.","Another example is a new commercial customer we got in Q3 that's developing a universal cancer screening test. And so previously, they've used a service provider that was operating a NextSeq to run their samples. But as this customer is now scaling, they're bringing the work in-house and so they purchased a NovaSeq. And they're using it to detect tumor mutational burdens across the 10 deadliest cancers at the earliest stages in patient blood samples. So, another customer.","A third example would be a new customer in Q3 that's using NovaSeq to start sequencing exomes, which allows a unified workflow for many of the sample types that they run. And they're planning to slowly transition from smaller panels to exomes once all the proper validations have happened.","And so across those three examples, you can see that the thesis we had going in, which is as we democratize access to high throughput sequencing, we will see customers doing broader sequencing, doing deeper sequencing, and moving from panels to exomes and genomes are starting to play out, certainly, in those examples. And so that's some of the color behind what's driving the uptake for NovaSeq.","Sam Samad","With regards to Q4, Ross, maybe let me just give you some color to add to some of my comments on the call. So, obviously, very pleased with the result in Q3. In terms of Q4, we expect, as I mentioned, flat to sequentially modestly up in Q4. And basically, some of the key driver is there when you look at it.","First of all, in terms of China tariffs, it's important to highlight a couple of things there because that's an important driver on Q4. We believe that roughly $20 million of orders in Q4 have been accelerated into both Q2 and Q3. Some of that acceleration was actually from Q3 into Q2, but then the balance was really from Q4 into earlier in the year.","So, by and large, you have to expect that roughly $20 million less consumables in Q4 that were accelerated into earlier in the year because of some handful of customers -- Chinese customers, buying ahead of tariffs. So, that's an impact on sequencing consumables, which, as I mentioned on the call, will be slightly down in Q4.","In terms of instruments, and we saw this in Q3 as we've had -- as we said before, we expected that the second half of the year will be higher in terms of instruments. And we started to see that in Q3 and we expect to see that in Q4 as well as we expect a meaningful ramp in terms of instrument revenue.","And then finally, with regards to arrays, we had in Q3 a very strong quarter for array instruments. So, that presents a bit of a quarter-on-quarter from Q3 to Q4, a slight reduction in terms of arrays, primarily because we've had a strong quarter in Q3 in terms of higher array instrument.","And as you know, array -- there's some seasonality behind arrays as well. But again, we saw strong performance in Q3. A lot of that was driven by instrument placements ahead of the holiday season.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan. Sir, you may begin.","Tycho Peterson","Hey thanks. You guys, obviously, have a ton of momentum that's playing out on strong instrument placements and better than expected pull-through on NovaSeqs; I think at least relative to what people have been modeling originally. That said it's been a while since we've asked on competitive dynamics. So, I'm just wondering you've got one competitor talking about $1,000 platinum grade genomes.","You've got another talking about 300, albeit not in the U.S. Another has talked about 60 gigs of throughput. Does any of this change your view, I guess, of competitive dynamics? How should we think about any of this impacting the selling cycle?","And maybe can you just talk on levers that you may pull, in particular thoughts on moving down the cost curve given that you've previously talked about $100 genome down the road?","Francis deSouza","Sure. So, Tycho, obviously with a market this big and this much growth ahead of it and still being in such earlier stages, you'd expect to see it attracts a lot of players. And we've been talking about the players in the space and the segments they play into.","We continue to see, as you pointed out, BGI talking about low cost sequencing and running samples for customers in China at a lower cost for -- per genome than outsourcing customers can get elsewhere in the market.","And the competitive dynamic there is still largely the same in the sense that if you compare what customers can get with our products compared with what they can get in BGI, there's a big difference in terms of the quality of the data that you get off the instruments, in terms of the reliability of the instruments; if you purchase the instrument yourself. And then there is some -- in some cases, just concern in terms of the privacy of the data or shipping samples to China.","In some cases, there are actually restrictions, whether it's national restrictions in some countries about shipping biological samples outside or data restrictions around having the data outside the country. And in some countries like in the U.S., there are restrictions from funding sources. So, some of the funding sources for academic projects don't allow you to ship samples outside the country to China. And if you do, you risk not being able to get future funding from those sources.","But the primary competitive dynamic in that case is really about the reliability and the quality of the data you get from our instrument. And those are dimensions that we continue to invest and to raise the bar and become more and more important as we get into the clinical markets.","We continue to look at adjacent markets and what's happening there like the long read market and look at the improvements that are happening there in terms of the gradual improvements in accuracy and the price improvements. And that continues to be a complementary market to us, right? If you look at how customers use those technologies, what they'll do is they'll buy a long read instrument or they'll outsource to a long read service provider to do scaffolding, de novo, create the reference genome, and then drive a lot of their production work on to Illumina instruments.","And so in some sense, the way the dynamics been playing out over the years is the more species that get sequenced through the long read technologies, the more sequencing that drives to Illumina. And the competitive dynamic there is while they can do the reference genomes our cost advantage means that anything in production you'd want to do on our instruments.","And we've publicly stated that we continue to want to drive the price down over the years as we have. And so we expect that separation of the markets to continue to play out going forward.","But overall, if you take a step back, the fact that you're seeing multiple players in the market innovate across different dimensions that you're seeing the venture community get interest in the market really does validate just how enormous the opportunity in front of us is and validates that we're really at the early stages of this big opportunity.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question in the queue comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is open sir, you may begin.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Thank you and good afternoon. I want to follow-up on the $14 million stocking order in China. First, how much of this is attributable to NovaSeq? Second, are you only seeing this with consumables? And if so, why?","Third, how do you confidently know it's stocking and not fundamental demand, given it's happened a couple of quarters in a row? And lastly and probably most importantly, adjusted for the China bulk orders, are you continuing to see an increase in utilization for NovaSeq globally? Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Sam Samad","Yes. So, I'll start, Doug, by talking a little bit about the tariffs activity. So, as we mentioned last quarter, we had $13 million in Q2. That was accelerated from later in the year. And we believe that was a mix between Q3 and Q4 that was accelerated into Q2. And then in Q3, as I've just mentioned on the prepared remarks, we had $14 million that was accelerated from Q4.","That again is a handful of Chinese customers. Our intel -- our discussions do definitely point to the fact that these are really ahead of the concern around tariffs, a concern that there might be additional tariffs on consumables and so pre-buying ahead of that.","In terms of the mix of those, I would say a good proportion -- a large proportion of them is NovaSeq, but they're not entirely all NovaSeq. So, just to clarify, we believe that, as I said, a large proportion of those orders are NovaSeq.","But just in terms of tariffs, as a whole, let me give you little bit of backdrop as well and some context. In Q3, we did receive notification that there were tariffs of 5% that were placed on instruments. So, that's been the only tariffs that have been placed on our products. There hasn't been anything that's placed on consumables. So, we know that there's been 5% placed on instruments. That's a modest amount, and there has not been anything else that's been announced on consumables. But obviously, customers in China have still been a little bit cautious and advancing some purchases ahead of potential tariffs.","As I've mentioned before, again, sequencing -- investments in sequencing is definitely a commitment and not easily redirected. So, we don't believe that even with tariff, this changes the landscape materially because customers will still have this commitment to sequencing.","Our instruments -- our consumables are proprietary. Our consumables only work with our instruments, and so there's definitely, I would say, more of a long-term commitment to sequencing. We believe this is more of a timing driver as opposed to something that changes the landscape, even if tariffs do get placed on our consumables.","Francis deSouza","Yes. And if I had to add to what Sam just said, I'll take a step back and look at the China market. If you look at our growth in China for the first three quarters of 2018, that's been approximately 30% revenue growth year-on-year. Now, if you take that same period a year ago, it was 25% growth approximately. And so our business in China is bigger than it was last year and it's growing faster than it was last year. And the tariff effect is a small part of that bigger story of what's happening in China.","Sam Samad","And one last thing, Doug, on the question that you asked as well. All of the purchases, the $13 million and the $14 million we announced, have been consumables, not instruments.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. So, as we're thinking about the cadence of the business into 2019, could you comment, is there anything we should be mindful of on the PopSeq front as GeL is rolling off? And anything we should be thinking about in terms of leverage down the P&L? Thanks.","Francis deSouza","So, if I look at the population sequencing initiatives, it's clear that governments all around the world are recognizing the value of population genomics studies as a fundamental enabler to precision medicine and those initiatives around improving both the quality of the healthcare system and driving cost out. And now we're engaged in several dozen population sequencing initiatives around the world.","If we look at, though, 2019, there are a number of things that are going to play out. In the U.K., which already pioneered the area of population sequencing, we expect GeL to complete its 100,000 genomes in the coming months, it may sort of lead into the beginning of next year. They publicly announced they've crossed over 87,000 whole-genome sequencing. And so that will play out over the coming months entering into 2019.","And then they've announced that the next phase of GeL will be driven out of the NHS. And so you can expect to see that starting to ramp-up in 2019, and there'll be a ramp-up period, but that's the big transition you'll expect to see from GeL. That's a very exciting transition because in Phase I, GeL talked about 100,000 genomes. And the message coming out from the U.K. is that they have a vision to do 5 million genomes as part of the next phase of the project. Those -- that will take time, though, to play out, but it's a much bigger opportunity that will start in 2019.","Similarly now, if you look in the U.S., and you know what's happened over the last few weeks even, is that the -- we've seen progress around the All of Us Precision Medicine Initiative. That was launched in May and the vision was ready to sequence million samples over 10 years and the budget for All of Us was announced. And that was $376 million for 2019, up from $290 million in 2018.","And so they've got the budget for 2019 over the last few weeks, All of Us has now selected the three genome centers that they are going to use to do the sequencing and the genotyping. So, they selected Baylor, Broad, and UW to do the sequencing. And so you can start to see that roll out as we get into 2019.","You'll also see progress from Yale. They've announced their project, a large genome medicine project for 100,000 patients, with more than $20 million in funding that they've secured and that is expected to start in early 2019.","In addition to those are again many, many, many initiatives that we are working on, there's the initiative in France that was supposed to go into pilot in the next few -- by the end of this year, we think it will happen early next year. So, there are many other initiatives that we're working on as well, and so that's the color on some of the big ones.","Sam Samad","And with regards to leverage, Dan, obviously, it's early to talk about 2019 and what our projections and thoughts are there. But all I would say is fundamentally, our commitment to leverage hasn't changed. We're still committed to leverage. We will still look for transformational investments and make those. But overall, we're still fundamentally committed to creating leverage in the P&L.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Derik se Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open, you may begin sir.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good afternoon.","Francis deSouza","Hi Derik.","Derik de Bruin","So, a couple of short ones, if I may. So, just following up on the stocking question, how many quarters of material of consumables were stocked? And this goes the question of what is the shelf life of these products? I'm just trying to get a sense of when we would potentially see a reorder when they would burn through this.","Question -- and then a question on -- we've had some really good NIH funding. I'm just curious, is -- are the grants have been written over the last year or so, how many of those throughput in the NovaSeq?","And I guess, if you've seen sort of an upgrade cycle, bolus of instrument sales of NovaSeqs sort of coming through, is that part of your pipeline of sales in the back half of the year for NovaSeq? Thanks.","Sam Samad","So, maybe I'll start with the consumable question, Derik and then I'll let Francis answer the question about the research funding grants. With regards to consumables, we -- our shelf-life is usually somewhere in the six-month to nine-month range. So, in terms of placing orders out of -- or for stocking or two ahead of potential tariffs, obviously, they'll keep that in mind in terms of the shelf-life and in terms of the expiration. They cannot exceed the six-month timeframe usually and I would say six months to nine months is probably a good range for it.","Francis deSouza","Yes. And then if we think about how the grants are playing out, I think obviously we're very, very happy with how funding is developing in terms of the budgets going out. I mean the $2 billion increase in NIH budget was a welcome use in the industry. We also continue to see a shifting of the budget to genomics-based studies across a variety of academic domains. We talked about interesting work that's happening in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and lots of other chronic conditions to.","So, not only is the overall budget envelope going up, but we continue to see a shift of the budget to genomic testing, which is obviously really good news for science and really good news for us as well.","In terms of NovaSeqs, we are starting to see -- it used to be -- I don't know if you recall last year, but certainly, with TOPMed here in the U.S., they still wanted the grants they were giving out to be for projects that were running the X. And they wanted the projects to continue to run the X because that's how they've done it before and that's changed.","We are not yet at the stage, where they are requiring NovaSeqs as we saw before with the HiSeq X. So, we're in that transition where they're saying, yes, you can and, in fact, the people that do and have better economics you think have a better chance of winning those projects and typically what happens is that the next stages, it just becomes a requirement in terms of applying for those grants.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question in the queue comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open, you may begin.","Mark Massaro","Hey thanks for the questions. It seems like with All of Us U.K., Geisinger, liquid biopsy studies, we can quickly count 10 million genomes that will be sequenced. The last four quarters, you've put up 30% sequencing consumables growth on average, recognizing that this quarter was 23%. As we think about next year, is there any particular reason why sequencing consumables should materially step down from current levels?","And then related to that -- or I should say, a second part of this question, when we think about Geisinger as a health system doing exome sequencing for their population, Francis, can you give us a sense if you are talking to other clinical health systems or IDNs to do broad-based exome sequencing on people?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So, if I think about the things that have driven demand that have given us that 23%-plus growth rate in sequencing consumables not just in the quarter but just past the previous quarters, a lot of those secular trends are here to stay. And there's nothing I can point to for the last year and say that was an unusual thing or a temporal thing. They're maybe timing thing.","So, for example, GeL was running at full force this week. It's going to scale up and go into the NHS. There may be a transition that plays out. But in terms of almost every trend that I can point to that drove demand this year, whether it's liquid biopsy, population sequencing on the NIPT side, all of those trends are poised to grow going into the future, right? We're going to have more people doing NIPT tests.","So, liquid biopsies, today, we saw Guardant360, and not it's really exciting get reimbursement from Palmetto. It got the local coverage decision around the liquid biopsy test for non-small cell lung cancer and that was the first. And so liquid biopsy, you expect there to be more of.","So, again, the trends are secular trends. They're going to play out. Trends like the population sequencing trends are going to play out over a multiyear period. So, at this stage, we're not telling you with any particular quarter, it looks certainly not next year, but you're absolutely right. These are durable secular trends. What's the second part of the question? I think that was it.","Mark Massaro","Exome sequencing with Geisinger to potentially other health businesses?","Francis deSouza","Yes, we absolutely are. So, the announcement of Geisinger made around doing whole exome sequencing for all the couple millions of patients in their health system has triggered conversations about having the -- your exome or your genome be a part of your health record.","So, we're having those conversations. Nothing has been announced yet, but as you can imagine, it definitely triggered interest from other health systems, especially ones where they have capitated patients or they have patients that tend to be in the system for a long time. They are the ones that are leading the conversations right now.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Puneet Souda with Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Puneet Souda","Yes, hi Francis. Thanks.","Francis deSouza","Hi Puneet.","Puneet Souda","Hi thanks. So, I have a bigger question on the next leg of growth here for you, given that the leading labs have picked up NovaSeq in 2017 and the next or the mid-tier labs are picking up NovaSeqs this year. You've highlighted in the past that there are 850-plus customers or so, and I think you said north of 200 or so have taken the delivery of NovaSeq.","Just help us understand how do you see the broader potentially lower throughput labs buying into NovaSeq? Do you expect them to buy into NovaSeq? Do you see a relevance of S Prime there? Or do you expect them to move to NextSeq? How do you get those broader labs into the new instrument upgrade cycle?","Francis deSouza","Sure. I'll start by saying if you take a step back, I think we still have the majority of the upgrade is in front of us in total. So, if you add up the total number of customers or the total number of systems, I don't think we've crossed over the halfway point even off the upgrade cycle.","And now I'll talk a little bit of a segment story. If you look at the high throughput -- the large centers, the majority of them have bought a NovaSeq, that's true, but a small minority of them that have completely cut over to a NovaSeq. And so the work in front of us, both in terms of orders, in terms of shipments and in terms of implementations for our customers is really to do that cutover. And that's not been a 2017 story or an 2018 story, that's a 2019-plus story.","And we still have, if you look at the smaller labs, still large labs, so core labs, but it's a smaller end of it, there's still lot of them that have yet upgrade to a NovaSeq. And so a lot of the ones that we expect to buy one or two NovaSeqs, that business still in front of us. And some of them are waiting for the S Prime, which will come out in the coming months and that's important for them. Some of them were waiting for the S1, which just came out earlier this year and are in a valuation cycle right now. And so you add up all those different dynamics, and I'd say the majority of that upgrade is still in front of us.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Daniel Brennan with UBS. Your line is open sir, you may begin.","Daniel Brennan","Great. Hey Francis thanks for the questions. I was hoping maybe you can provide a little color on maybe your revenue mix by customer today between research and clinical and translational other.","And then specifically as you think about the clinical business, any color how to think about the growth rate of that business going forward. Obviously, there were a few questions already on that, but I'm just wondering if we're at a point where growth is inflecting given the progress on a number of fronts you cited. Thanks.","Francis deSouza","So, if I look at the breakdown of the business between clinical and translational research, it's continuing to build in the same way we've seen, consistent what we've seen in previous quarters. So, we said previously, if you look at clinical and translational, it's in sort of the mid to high 40s as a percentage of our revenue. That continues to be true. And the drivers of the clinical business are NIPT and certainly in Europe, we're seeing strong growth with the launch of VeriSeq NIPT off our NIPT business.","One of the things we are doing there is we're continuing to get clearance for the VeriSeq NIPT product to expand the addressable market for that solution. That's been a lot of the work we've been doing this year. And so you should see that start to play in next year.","The other big driver, obviously, of our clinical business is our oncology segment. And there, there are a number of factors. We have the large liquid biopsy customers. We have the clinical commercial customers that are driving a lot of our oncology business. We see a lot of translational business that comes out of the academic cancer centers. The work that's happening there, a lot of it is around immunotherapy and doing the work to identify the predictors of success of immunotherapy. And all of those things are going to continue to build into next year.","Daniel Brennan","Great. And then maybe just one follow-up kind of related to the prior question regarding amongst those high throughput customers that have already upgraded to the NovaSeq and kind of retired their old instruments, can you just discuss kind of what you're seeing from those customers in terms of demand elasticity, maybe kind of how those customers are spending with Illumina on consumables? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Yes, it's an important metric for us to track. And one of the things we did, and we touched on it the last earnings call a little bit was what we look at is we look at the total consumable spend of our high throughput customers. And we look at them before they got a NovaSeq and we look at the ones that don't have a NovaSeq yet and we look at the ones that also bought a NovaSeq.","And what we shared was that we saw that high throughput customers that had bought a NovaSeq, in aggregate, they were spending more with us than ones that haven't bought a NovaSeq. And that actually intuitively makes sense, right? So, you're seeing the reason people are buying the most powerful sequencer in the world is because they anticipate more demand for it. And the dynamic we've known in the market is that given the research that our customers want to do, if they have a budget, they want to spend that budget doing as high quality research as they can.","And so if they can get a more powerful instrument like a NovaSeq to replace a HiSeq, then what they'll do is they'll do a higher powered study. And so they'll put more samples into the study to generate higher quality science. And so they take the power they have, and they'll use as many samples as they can for that study. So, it's not that they will use less samples when they have the NovaSeq. And that's borne out by the numbers that we're seeing.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open, you may begin sir.","Dan Arias","Good afternoon. Thanks for getting me in here. Francis, maybe on NIPT and the expectations for some good growth in that market next year. I'm just curious whether you think if we do get a big step-up in average risk testing you think that there's a capacity expansion that goes along with that. Do you kind of feel like there's a need to buy boxes? Or do the labs kind of have the infrastructure that they need? Thanks.","Francis deSouza","Sure. If you think about NIPT going into next year and sort of where the growth will come from, I think there are a couple of vectors that will drive growth for NIPT. In the U.S., I think as you point out, one of the things that will drive growth is the increased adoption and coverage for average risk customers.","So, we're continuing to make progress -- incremental progress in terms of the percentage of covered lives in the U.S. that have access to NIPT for average risk pregnancies. In September, for example, we got Florida Medicaid that became the first state Medicaid program to cover NIPT for average risk.","We continue to see some of the payers that I talked about that came online the last quarter. And overall now, we're at 43% of covered lives have access to NIPT testing for average risk pregnancies.","The big -- there are a couple of big payers, though, that have not yet moved like, for example, United. And for them, we think a move in the guidelines will be important. And if we look at how that's played out over the year, we've made some progress there.","So, if you look at ACOG here in the U.S., they've withdrawn their practice bulletin 640, which question the utility of average risk NIPT. And some in the industry feel that's a precursor for them actually endorsing NIPT for average risk pregnancies because the removal of 640 now leaves the more supportive ACOG 163 in -- as their practice bulletin. And that indicates that the sensitivity and specificity of NIPT is very similar to levels previously published for high risk pregnancies.","And so we're making progress with ACOG. And as those guidelines come into play, so I think that will continue to be positive in terms of the couple of large bears that have yet to move. So, one big driver of NIPT growth is going to be continued coverage for average risk -- expansion of the coverage for average risk pregnancies here in the U.S.","And then internationally, it's the adoption of VeriSeq NIPT and the coverage of NIPT by the national systems. And so if you look at where we are in Europe, 100% of pregnancies in Europe are covered for NIPT in Belgium, in the Netherlands, we have very well-contingent screening in the U.K., France, and Switzerland. And in Germany, we've just seen some progress with the German HDA publishing assessment acknowledging the diagnostic value of NIPT for trisomy 21 and so making incremental progress in terms of Germany adopting NIPT.","And then the other big vector is going to be China. We continue to see growth there, closing in on 20 million pregnancies a year in China. Today, we see 3-ish million, 4-ish million NIPT across everybody, all the players in the market being done. And so there's still an untapped opportunity in China. So, those are the things that will drive NIPT growth.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Catherine Schulte","Hi, thanks for the questions. Francis appreciated your comments on the early interest you're seeing in iSeq. But can you give us some more anecdotal commentary on the types of customers you've seen there and what the typical use cases are?","Francis deSouza","Sure. I am very excited about the potential for iSeq and the strategic role it will play in our portfolio. If I look at who's buying iSeq, I'd say broadly, there are three types of customers that are buying iSeq today. The first one, and not surprisingly, they are the ones that were out of the gate the fastest. They were a big part of the early orders of iSeq are actually existing Illumina customers.","And what they love about iSeq is they're telling us that it is a terrific box to do a quality control step on a library before you fire up a run on a NovaSeq or any of our other machines because you could spend tens of thousands of dollars on a NovaSeq run. And you would want to know before you did that if there was something wrong with the library.","And so it's a terrific little instrument that allows you to do a quick QC step before you run a NovaSeq run. And so a lot of customers have understood that and we're seeing orders for iSeq to support that use case.","Another set of customers are customers who are much smaller labs. And they do sequencing today, but they don't have either the capital or the sample volume to purchase their own MiSeq or MiniSeq and so they're outsourcing today. And so iSeq is a very accessible instrument for them, and they're excited about bringing some of that sequencing in-house. And we're seeing customers for iSeq that are exactly that, very familiar with sequencing. In fact, they are sequencing customers; they just don't have their own instrument.","And then long-term and probably among the most exciting segments is going to be the tens of thousands of labs today that don't do sequencing. And as they start to understand the role that genomics can play in the research that they do, iSeq is a terrific instrument to open up that largely untapped market that those are labs that today may be buying qPCR boxes, for example, but don't do sequencing at all. And we think that this is the perfect instrument to get into that market.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. You may begin sir.","Patrick Donnelly","Great. Thanks. Maybe just one on the liquid biopsy market. We recently saw the first dedicated company in that space is a customer of yours become public to a pretty strong reception. Can you just update on us on that market? How we should be thinking about where we are in terms of placements and consumables already being used for trials compared to the opportunity over the next few years as these companies continue to raise funds and invest in developing the market?","Francis deSouza","Yes, that is a really exciting segment in the oncology market. We are now seeing liquid biopsy being used in various stages of the cancer journey, right? So, we're seeing some very high-profile companies like a GRAIL or a Freenome that are interested in using liquid biopsy as a screening tool for asymptomatic individuals. And so they're going after the population at large, and they're designing tests that have to have really high sensitivity and specificity to be used as a population screen.","And the results we're seeing continue to be very encouraging. The results that the GRAIL team shared at ASCO earlier this year are really encouraging in terms of them being able to bring out a test that has the right sensitivity and specificity across cancer types.","Then you're seeing companies like Guardant. And what's exciting about what Guardant is doing is they're using liquid biopsy at a different stage of the cancer journey. And they're saying this is for people who already have cancer. And with their Guardant360 test, you're able to identify the molecular profile of the cancer a patient has.","And that is especially important for things like lung cancer, where it is really difficult to get samples from a patient and it's hard to get samples that are not degraded. And so to be able to do that from a blood test is really enabling for those patients.","Guardant is also looking at using liquid biopsy as a tool to assess the effectiveness of a therapy through MRD to look for recurrence. And so those are all applications that also lend themselves for liquid biopsy rather than tissue biopsy.","And what's especially exciting is that some of the companies are now getting into the space and some of the commercial entities that are being created to deliver liquid biopsy tests are not the usual suspects. They're not just a Silicon Valley cloud. The example I gave was not a usual suspect. It was a new company that was created just to deliver a universal cancer screening test.","And so we're seeing a lot of investment poured into this area because there's a recognition of the enormous promise of liquid biopsy to do better screens and ultimately, improve outcomes for patients.","Operator","Thank you, sir. We have time for one more question. That question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, you may begin.","Steve Beuchaw","Well, thanks for letting me run the anchor leg of the relay here. I will try to round out the conversation on the different drivers and maybe touch on consumer. Really interesting growth story with the number of samples that have been access there. If you think about over the last year or two consumer as a driver of growth, it's happened in part because there have been a number of players out there that have taken advantage of some of the products you launched at ASHG a couple of years back, taken their price structure down, taken their prices down, taken their promotional intensity with DTC advertising presentation on Amazon higher. Can you talk about over the next year or two how you think the intensity of the push is in consumer relative to the last year or two? Thanks.","Francis deSouza","Yes, it's a great question and I'm glad we got to touch on the consumer market because it's a very exciting market and it's a large market going forward. And we did -- as we touched on, we did see an inflection in the consumer market play out in 2017. And in 2017, we -- sequence are genotyped more samples that year, so 7 million samples in 2017 than we done in the previous 10 years combined. The space started in 2007 when it launched 23andMe.","And we saw that inflection point. And that inflection point last year was driven by -- it was primarily a U.S. story. It was primarily an Ancestry story, and it was primarily driven by a couple of the big players in that space.","This year, we've continued to see the growth in the genealogy segment, but we've seen other things play out. One, we've seen just more players emerge in the market. And so we are tracking a large number of companies now that are in the DTC space around the world. And we started to see revenue contribution show up, as I talked about it, for example, from Southeast Asia. And so we're starting to see DTC become a more global story than it, frankly, has ever been and we're definitely at the very early stages of that. Frankly, we're at the early stages of it in the U.S. and we're at the, really, really, early stages of it outside the U.S.","We're also seeing a broadening of the drivers for consumer genomics, right? So, if I said the first driver of it was genealogy, the discoveries that have happened have now enabled more reports to be generated for customers. And so some of the pool is now coming from segments that are broader than genealogy. It's health traits, it's wellness, it's nutrition, it's fitness and that's expanded -- and that's the story of 2018. And the revenue from it, we expect to come in future years, but the idea of it really showed up in 2018.","We're also excited about the potential for Helix to continue to expand that opportunity and continue to enable innovation for consumers to try out different reports in consumer genomics and figure out where the next growth vector could be.","And so those are the dynamics around consumer and genomics that have showed up. We continue to see the growth driven by genealogy. It's now much more of a global story. It's much more diverse in terms of number of customers that are interested in doing it and a number of segments that they are targeting, but very early across the Board.","Operator","Thank you.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During this section of today's call, I will review our second quarter financial results and our guidance for the remainder of the year. I will then turn the call over to Jay to provide an update on our commercial progress and the state of our business and market.","We have continued our positive revenue and earnings momentum with our third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in both revenue and earnings per share. In Q2, we had record operating margins and record orders of the both the MiSeq instrument and MiSeq sequencing consumables. Second quarter 2012 revenue increased 3% sequentially to $281 million due to another successful quarter of MiSeq shipments, higher service revenue and continued growth in sequencing consumables.","Revenue for the quarter decreased 2% compared to Q2 2011 as last year's quarter included a greater number of HiSeq sales. Instrument revenue for the second quarter was $72 million compared to Q2 2011. Instrument revenue was down 32%, again primarily due to decrease in sequencing and microarray instrumentation.","Consumable revenue for the quarter was $184 million, up 6% sequentially and up 16% compared to the second quarter of 2011. Consumable revenue now represents 65% of our total revenue compared to 55% this time last year.","We are very pleased with this trend, which results from a larger install base of both HiSeq and MiSeq and a sequentially improved average annualized quarter on HiSeqs. In particular, record shipments of our [indiscernible]product including TruSeq and Nextera contributed to the sequential growth consumable revenue.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services, as well as instrument maintenance contract, was $22 million for the quarter compared to $18 million from Q2 of last year. This growth is also encouraging.","In our discussion of gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude non-cash stock competition expense, restructuring charges and in-process R&D charge and other non-cash items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 70.9%. This compares to 69% in both last quarter and the second quarter of 2011. The sequential improvement was attributable primarily to a favorable mix of consumable versus instrument revenue and improved absorption. The year-over-year gross margin increase was also driven by a favorable product mix. We continue to expect gross margins of approximately 70% for the full year as improvements in consumable mix are somewhat offset by expected MiSeq care [indiscernible] reduction as our trade-in program continues to gain traction and by increasing FastTrack Services revenue.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter was $41 million or 14.7% of revenue compared to 14.9% of revenue in the first quarter and 14.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $55 million or 19.4% of revenue compared to 18.9% of revenue in the first quarter and 19.1% of revenue in the second quarter of 2011.","Adjusted operating margins were a record 36.7% of revenue in the quarter compared to 35.8% of revenue in the second quarter of 2011 as we gain leverage from the improved gross margin performance.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.8% compared to 34.7% in the second quarter of last year. This quarter's tax rate was higher than the expected annualized rate as a result of the delay in the passage of the U.S. R&D tax credit. We anticipate the non-GAAP tax rate will continue to be approximately 34% until the R&D tax credit is passed and retroactively applied at some point this year.","Non-GAAP net income was $53 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.40. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $52 million and $0.38, respectively, in the second quarter of 2011. We reported GAAP net income of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to $31 million or $0.22 per diluted share in the prior-year period. This includes an impairment charge this quarter of $21.4 million related to a technology asset acquired in 2010 and $6.7 million of ongoing unsolicited tender offer expenses.","During the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $96 million. We used approximately $21 million for cash capital expenditures resulting in $75 million of free cash flow. This compares to $55 million of free cash flow in the second quarter of last year and $52 million in Q1 of this year.","DSO decreased to 61 days compared to 67 days last quarter and 61 days last year. And we ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments.","During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 800,000 shares for $32 million. With these purchases, we have slightly over $200 million remaining in our authorized share buyback program.","We are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of 2012. While some uncertainty exists with respect to academic and research funding in the second half of the year, our outlook is generally as we anticipated. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2012 revenue guidance and increasing our non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share expectation from $1.40 to $1.50 to now be between $1.50 and $1.60.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Jay for some remarks on our commercial activity during the quarter before we begin the Q&A session.","Jay T. Flatley","Thanks, Marc. We are very pleased with our second quarter results. The positive trends that began after Q3 2011 have continued through first half of 2012. We had sequential revenue and EPS growth with record operating margins, and we believe we positioned the company well in light of the macro uncertainty expected in the second half the year.","While there's no clarity on sequestration and the NIH budget for 2013 remains uncertain, we continue to believe that the worst case 8% funding reduction is an unlikely scenario. The Obama administration has proposed a flat NIH budget for 2013, while last month, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $100 million increase to the NIH budget for next year. More recently, the House Committee on Appropriations released their fiscal year 2013 Labor, Health and Human Services Funding Bill, which proposed roughly flat NIH funding year-over-year. While these are all positive indicators, we don't expect any budget clarity until a few months after the election. We also believe that our U.S. academic customers are better prepared than last year for budget challenges and are planning accordingly. In light of that, it's our view that the overall funding dynamics this year are considerably more favorable than last year, and we've considered a range of potential budget outcomes in formulating our annual guidance.","We remind investors that in Q1 2012, our core sequencing consumable revenue was for the first time ever greater than instrument revenue, and this continued in Q2. A greater mix of consumable to instrument revenue provides more inherent visibility on our business. To improve this visibility even further, as we discussed in our Q1 earnings call, we proactively worked with some of our customers to project their consumable demands for the rest of the calendar year. By agreeing upfront to take periodic noncancelable, consumable shipments, these customers avoided our Q2 price increase. Tremendous growth in our sample prep products also improves this visibility given their highly recurring use and our customers' workflow.","We're also seeing a continuing evolution of our customer mix toward more commercial, clinical and applied accounts reducing our exposure to academic funding. To further enhance our portfolio and product diversity, we announced a number of new offerings during the quarter, including Nextera XT DNA Sample Prep kits, the BaseSpace Apps store, the iSAAC genome alignment tool and a RapidTrack Whole Genome Sequencing Service. Additionally, we have numerous products that will begin shipment in the near term including the HiSeq 2500, the associated HiSeq 2000 upgrades, enhanced MiSeq, a 2 by 250 base pair of MiSeq sequencing kit and lower throughput kit, NuPCR consumables and new sample prep products like Nextera Exome and Custom Arrangement kit.","While our overall view in the second half of the year remains cautious, with improved forecast visibility, new products and services launches, the change in customer mix, improved customer planning and fewer funding dynamics at play, we believe that we're in considerably more favorable position this year relative to last year.","Let me turn now to some specific results of the quarter. Shipments during the quarter to the Americas were healthy with U.S. shipments up 18%, Canadian shipments up 15% and Brazil shipments up over 100% year-over-year. Since opening an office in S\u00e3o Paulo in Q1 on 2011, Brazil has moved up to be a top 12 country as measured by x U.S. shipments.","With regard to Europe, we've not seen a material change, and our business there remains stable overall. Shipments to Spain and Italy actually increased sequentially during the quarter. Shipments to Asia, while down sequentially, grew year-over-year and remain healthy. This sequential decrease was expected as Q1 is the end of the Japanese fiscal year. Notable strength was seen in China where shipments grew 50% year-over-year. In the array business, total microarray revenue was roughly flat sequentially. This quarter marked the second-highest number of Infinium samples ever shipped. We received orders for approximately 250,000 more Exome samples bringing total samples order to date to approximately 1.6 million, by far the highest number of samples for any content collection in the company's history.","New unit orders for iScan and HiScan microarray instrumentation were the highest since Q2 2011. In addition, Q2 saw market sequential orders strength in our Omni express, as well as our Ag arrays, including Bovine LD, PorcineSNP60 and MaizeSNP50. Our CytoSNP array shipments had their second best quarter ever and remain on track for submission of our iScan with CytoSNP for FDA 510(k) approval later this year.","Yesterday, we launched our real-time PCR reagent portfolio, including a novel probe-based chemistry for gene expression analysis that we call NuPCR. In addition to the NuPCR reagent, we announced qPCR DNA-binding assays for gene expression and qPCR High Resolution Melt assays for genotyping studies. These provide researchers with a trio of high-quality, budget-friendly options in the qPCR reagent market. This reagent portfolio will be sold through our worldwide distribution network. Availability of NuPCR in the United States will be announced in the near future.","NuPCR is a novel probe-based technology that doesn't rely on exonuclease activity to generate signal. Instead, the catalytic activities inherent in the 3-part oligo probe resulting in higher sensitivity experiments and consistently detect targets earlier in the cycle count and competing real-time PCR probes and it reduced cost. This collection of new assays is compatible with any real-time PCR platform offering researchers a wider range of choices. Additionally, all the assays are custom-designed using DesignStudio, a personalized web-based design tool available to Illumina customers. This unique easy-to-use software delivers bioinformatically optimized assays, ensuring high PCR efficiencies and assays that work the first time without tedious trial and error optimization, while also enabling simplified multiplexing.","Turning now to our sequencing business, total sequencing revenue in Q2 grew mid-single digits sequentially attributable primarily to growing sequencing consumables, as well as growing service revenue for maintenance contracts on our larger install base.","Total sequencing consumable revenue grew over 35% compared to Q2 of last year. We had record HiSeq and MiSeq consumable shipments during the quarter, and the average flow-through on HiSeq again increased sequentially. TruSeq and Nextera sample prep revenue year to date has grown 57% year-over-year demonstrating our focus on back-integrating into sample prep. We expect continued growth here as researchers convert from homebrew methods. We continue to gain competitive market share. We launched new sample prep product and our install base grows.","Average annualized consumable utilization of HiSeq increased to $338,000 in Q2 from $299,000 in Q1, and we have several reasons to feel confident that this level of utilization can continue as the effect of the consumable price increase announced in April should be more greatly reflected in future quarters.","Additionally, in Q4, we will begin to see the impact of the rapid run mode of the HiSeq 2500, which yields greater revenue per genome, and we expect to see sample prep revenue continue to grow.","During the quarter, we introduced the Nextera XT DNA sample prep kit, the easiest way for researchers to prepare and sequence low input small genomes, PCR amplicons and plasmids. Compared with MiSeq, Nextera XT provides the fastest timed result of any next-generation sequencing technology, enabling researchers to go from genomic DNA to analyze data in less than 8 hours. Nextera XT will also be available for HiSeq allowing up to 1,536 samples per HiSeq 2000 run and up to 384 samples per HiSeq 2500 in rapid run mode.","Last week, we introduced Nextera Exome and custom enrichment kit, leveraging the speed of Nextera technology and supporting the industry's lowest DNA sample input requirements, the new kits enable researchers to quickly and economically perform a wide range of studies from small focused gene panels to full human exomes. It also enable researchers to study small samples while retaining sufficient material for future analysis and offer the ability to process large numbers of samples without investing in automation systems.","Sequencing instrumentation revenue was down sequentially primarily as a result of reduced MiSeq shipments as the backlog of MiSeq orders from 2011 was mostly cleared in Q1. MiSeq ASPs were also down slightly during the quarter, largely a function of our continuing successful trade-in program. For the first time since the second half of 2010, HiSeq 2000 orders and shipments increased sequentially. ASPs of HiSeq 2000 shipped in Q2 also rose sequentially.","Through Q2, approximately 75% of new HiSeq 2000 orders have included an upgrade package. And as we begin to ship the new HiSeq 2500s in early Q4, the promotional upgrade price for the install base of HiSeqs will end, rising in price from $50,000 to $125,000.","With the shipment of the 2500, we will provide the ability for all HiSeq to stream data to BaseSpace removing the requirement for local IT and bioinformatic capability.","We continue to be very pleased with the market penetration of MiSeq. Customer feedback continues to be very positive, and the independent researchers have demonstrated, in peer-reviewed publications, the superiority of MiSeq over other desktop sequencers with regard to data quality, ease-of-use and end-to-end workflow. We're also pleased with the success of our trade-in program with such orders doubling sequentially from Q1.","During the quarter, customers placed record orders for both MiSeq instruments and consumables. And MiSeq consumable shipments grew almost 60% sequentially. The average annualized flow-through in Q2 on MiSeq was approximately $55,000.","The upgraded version of MiSeq will begin shipping from our factories within the next 2 weeks and the field upgrade program is about to begin. Initial test upgrades have gone extremely well. One of our early access customers has seen runs with throughput of approximately 10g with the data quality our customers have come to expect. With the new 2 by 250 base pair kits available on MiSeq, we expect aggressively market against longer read desktop machines and convert those users to MiSeq.","More than half the orders for MiSeq continue to come from non-academic customers. Finally, we remain on track to submit both the MiSeq platform and our own proprietary assay to the FDA for 510(k) approval before year end.","In our FastTrack Services business, we had record orders in Q2 resulting from booking approximately 3500 genomes as well as a large microarray service contract. We expect our success in genome bookings to continue in Q3.","During the quarter, we launched the RapidTrack Full Genome Sequencing Service, a new offering that will deliver a whole human genome in less than 2 weeks. This premium service offers the fastest sample to data turnaround time to any whole genome sequencing service available today.","Currently, we expect this service to be interesting to those research groups that needs samples analyzed quickly, to meet project deadlines or to submit grants and proof of principle studies. We've received several orders testing our RUO process with an eye towards qualifying this service under CLIA before the end of the year.","During the quarter, we introduced BaseSpace Apps, the dedicated application store for BaseSpace, our genomics cloud computing platform. Informatics solutions available through BaseSpace Apps will allow customers to leverage a growing community of academic, commercial and open-source tool providers for building applications around the Illumina data to dramatically simplify and accelerate genomic data analysis. Initially, 14 early-access vendors are developing apps for BaseSpace with more than 20 other vendors working to deploy in BaseSpace tune as a developer portal and API are released publicly later this quarter.","This morning, we announced our BaseSpace pricing for both data storage and downstream analysis. This is a first in the NGS market where customers will have the opportunity to receive free data storage and analysis on all Illumina data and have the ability to augment their account with flexible storage and app purchases. Our demonstrated leadership in informatics enables us to provide effective solutions for those lacking informatics infrastructure or expertise and allows us to open a new market opportunity. This informatics ecosystem will greatly simplify data analysis during and after our researches data has been generated. The data is always accessible and secure no matter where the research is located, and the App Store offers a wide range of bioinformatic tools and application. By greatly simplifying the management analysis of data, researchers can focus on the main task: understanding the biology.","We're also excited to announce a growing adoption of BaseSpace along our MiSeq users with a vast majority of MiSeq systems now connected to BaseSpace and roughly half of those actively uploading data, demonstrating that our architecture's resonating in the market.","This fall, Illumina will hold a company-sponsored symposium that we're calling Understand Your Genome to explore the best practices for deploying next-generation sequencing in a clinical setting. Illumina plans to sequence and analyze the genomes of approximately 60 participants as a multi-step process to engage experts in the field around whole genome sequencing.","The first day will feature presentations on clinical, laboratory, ethical, legal and social issues around WGS. The second day, participants will receive their genome data on an iPad and learn under the guidance of the medical geneticist how to analyze their results using their MyGenome app. Through this program and related efforts, we're laying the groundwork for routine clinical use of whole genome sequencing, clearly the wave of the future.","In conclusion, we're very pleased with our execution in the first half of 2012, and we're excited about our product lineup for the remainder of the year. We sequential revenue in EPS growth and record operating margins resulting from our focus on strong operational execution and continuous innovation to maintain our technological lead. And we continue to believe that the overall sequencing market has enormous potential and that we have the technology, people and infrastructure to maintain our market leadership and capitalize on this unique opportunity. Thank you for your time. We'll now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe the first question on the PCR announcement last night and I noticed in there, your talk about disruptive pricing. So I'm wondering if you're able to talk at all about your pricing strategy there. And should we expect a U.S. distribution partner for that business in the back half of the year? And lastly, can you talk a little bit about, do you need to expand the instrument lineup for your own business beyond Eco?","Jay T. Flatley","There's 3 different assays Eco that we announced. The principal one that we think will have the biggest market impact is the probe-based assays that we call NuPCR. And those we are pricing at disruptive level. So there'll be priced at about 50% of what the traditional PCR assays would be priced at in the overall market. It's a little bit complicated because there's a couple of different components. There's a master mix part that gets amortized over how many samples you run, but the probe-based part will be priced very aggressively. So we think that it has a great opportunity. And the fact that it runs across any install PCR instrument, we think, will be a big help. In terms of distribution, we are working on our U.S. distribution strategy. We have some interesting progress there, but nothing yet to announce today. So hopefully, in the back half of the year, we certainly plan to have some announcements about the U.S. distribution strategy. With respect to instrumentation, we're continuing to focus on this as a business unit, and we certainly are looking at ways to continue to involve the existing instrument as we do with most of our platforms and also clearly exploring what other new instruments we might put into the PCR space.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then turning to MiSeq, are you able to talk about system reliability in the field? There were some valid issues which obviously I think you worked through. But just are you able to talk about more broadly the downtime on MiSeq today? And I think Marc had made some comments earlier about discounts and instruments continuing. I'm wondering if there's anything more there in terms of pricing slippage? Or was that just reflective of the trade-in improvement?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We've been very pleased with the overall reliability, Tyco. But we have had one valve problem, the selector valve in the MiSeq. We've identified the root cause of that problem, had to do with particulates in the valve that was coming from our vendor. There's a couple of things we've done there. We -- the vendor now goes through an extensive wash protocol before they ship the valves to us. And these new valves are incorporated in all new shipments and have been for about a month, I think, now. We also introduced a wash protocol, so that anybody who has an instrument already, whenever the instrument runs or when it completes a run, we wash the valve out so that any particulates that were in the valve don't remain, because they essentially create nucleation sites for particulates, and that's what was freezing up the valves. And then as we go into these MiSeq upgrade in the field to the enhanced version of the MiSeq, we're going to change out any of the old valves and make sure all the instruments have brand new valve. So we think that field issue is totally taken care of. With respect to pricing, what we mentioned in the script really didn't have to do with discounting. The reduction ASP had to do with the trade-in program. I guess you could call that a discount in some way, but it's specifically around the trade-in program. So we have trade-ins for competitive instruments. And in some cases, we've taken some trade-ins for GAs as well. And in those cases, we've offered a credit off of the list price of MiSeq active customers. But other than that trade-in program, if you take that out of the numbers, the pricing for MiSeq is holding quite well.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Last one for me. Any color you can provide on orders or book-to-bill? We've worked it in the question as you can imagine from investors, so just wondering if you're willing to comment on either of those?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I mean, we don't want to get into a regular pattern of reporting book-to-bill. That hasn't been our typical pattern. We did talk about it the last 2 quarters because we were in the middle of the RUO situation, and there were question about whether we were pulling in revenue, and we felt that we had to disclose book-to-bill as a result. What I can say is that we are very pleased with our incoming order rate, that we exceeded our forecast, and we're very happy with the business. And as I indicated in the script, we are not seeing, at least as yet, any impact of funding concerns, but we remain cautious about the back half.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So the increase in HiSeq annualized utilization is $338,000, I believe you said. It's quite impressive. Does that revenue -- does that number include revenue associated with Nextera, and more broadly, your efforts to capture front-end revenue on sequencers? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is how much of this increase is that versus price hikes versus actual year-over-year increases in sequencing utilization?","Jay T. Flatley","It does include the sample reagents, Doug, so that is included in the numbers. If you turn the clock back a year, our sample prep revenue was a much smaller fraction, so it was less significant last year. So it is a component of that growth, which we think is fine. We'll take it however we can get it. But it certainly also, I think, is an indication of the overall increased utilization rate and a little bit of price increase. But most of the price impact I think you're going to start seeing next quarter. There's probably some in Q2 as well. But you'll probably see the full impact of the price increase in Q3.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But if you didn't have that initiative to get more of the front-end spend, would the utilization still be picking up quarter by quarter?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, it would, but not as dramatically.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. You kept operating spend about flat in dollar terms relative to Q1. Your guidance doesn't seem to incorporate a material increase in operating spend in dollar terms for the second half relative to the first half. You have a series of new products launching as you mentioned in your prepared remarks. I'd expect you're going to be rolling out new products over the balance of the year. You have aspirations in diagnostics amongst other areas. How long can you keep the spend at these levels, especially keeping in mind the streets are looking for 8% growth in '12 and '13, and clearly, folks would like more?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I mean, we definitely are planning some expense increases in the second half of the year, so I think the assumption that expenses would be flat in dollar terms isn't right. I mean, obviously, I think we'll try to keep them in the range as a percentage of revenue that we've been running in. But in dollar terms, we do expect to increase those expenses.","We were really pleased with our gross margin performance this quarter, so 70.9% is not as high as we've hit. Historically, we've hit a little bit higher than that, but it's pretty close to our historical all-time high. And we're feeling pretty positive about our ability to continue to push on the margin line. So I think from that perspective, we're feeling pretty comfortable about being able to increase expenses next year and hit the revised EPS that we put out there.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And, Jay, I think you said you're going to have the MiSeq and the proprietary assay at the FDA by year-end. Could you provide any more detail on what that assay is going to be?","Jay T. Flatley","We can't as yet, Doug, so we haven't disclosed what it's going to be. But it's -- I would describe it as an assay that will be unique to us in there, but doesn't have proprietary content. So this is not content that we have unique intellectual property around. Let's be clear about that.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And maybe if I can sneak in one very last one. How was your outlook for HiSeq placements evolved over the last couple of quarters given that it sounds like you had actually a pretty good HiSeq quarter for placement?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, we did. We've been really pleased with the impact the 2500 has had on the HiSeq trends. As we mentioned, about 75% of the incoming orders include the upgrade, so this idea that there's not money for capital is really not playing out here because it costs a significant more for customers to get that upgrade when they place the order. So I think that, that has helped our outlook on the overall sort of trend line for HiSeqs. We're actually seeing surprisingly good performance in the 1000 and 1500 as well. So we're probably doing a little better there than we might have forecast a year ago. So we're not ready to talk about extensive growth in the instrument number yet on HiSeq, but it grew sequentially, and we're really pleased with that, and we're obviously going to keep trying to move it up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I actually had a follow-up question on the guidance. Just looking at the revenue guidance that you've reaffirmed and just given the visibility that you have relative to last year in terms of the consumable usage. Can you help us frame out sort of how to think about the range and growth in the back half? Is that primarily funding driven? Or is there anything else that's key there?","Marc Stapley","Yes, Amanda, it's Marc Stapley here. We've got quite a broad range still for the second half given the uncertainty that Jay referred to in his prepared remarks. So we're thinking about -- there are a number of scenarios. Obviously, the bottom end of that range will represent a fairly flat revenue scenario in the second half and the top end of the range is obviously some fairly substantial growth. So we've modeled out those various scenarios. It clearly is funding driven. As we say, we haven't seen any effect on our international order rate at this point, but we still remain cautious there. And on the U.S. funding, we've got no more certainty than we've had with respect to that in the first half. So that's really how we're thinking about it. And our outlooks have been spending fairly well so far.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then just thinking about HiSeq consumable usage, just putting the price increase aside for a second. Can you just help us think about how the usage is coming across the major user bucket, so think about PGI versus the core labs versus genome centers? Just trying to get a sense of how that number can trend over the next few years and sort of how much is this coming from the smaller labs' increasing usage? And if you think about BaseSpace and some sample improvements or how important our data that 338 number going up over time.","Jay T. Flatley","I'd say in our largest customers, so BGI and the genome centers, that they still have some excess capacity. They drop back considerably during the 3Q challenges of last year when the NHGRI funding was up for grabs. They've come back from that level for sure but they still, we think, have some excess capacity. One of the things that is growing the number we think is that most of the incremental HiSeq orders we're getting at this point are from customers who already have a HiSeq. And what that implies is that they maxed capacity on the 1 they have or the 2 or the 3 that they have, and they're some incremental unit. And when that happens, typically, the overall utilization goes up because these people are in production, those customers are in production. So I think that's one very positive trend. Obviously, the pricing helps. The increased market share in sample prep helps. All those factors I think are potentially things you could argue might be able to nudge that number up a little bit. But because of the funding issues overall and the experience of last year, we're certainly not projecting it to go up because there could be some funding challenges in the back half. So those are the factors to consider when you try to model out where it might go.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, and then just switching to the MiSeq and the trade-in program that you talked about. Just curious if you can provide a perspective on how many, I don't know if it's boxes or sales sort of are -- I guess boxes more, were trade-in and how long do you anticipate running that program for?","Jay T. Flatley","It's open-ended, so we don't have a defined end date to it. We may put one on there at some point in time, but we don't have one now. I can say the quarter was in the range of 20-ish trade-ins overall across a mix of competitive instruments and a couple of our older GAs as well where we gave some trade-in credit. We -- the pipeline, as we look forward for potential additional trade-ins, is pretty rich. So we'll see what happens in Q3, but the potential is for the number to be at least higher, maybe higher.","Marc Stapley","I also think with the performance of the MiSeq and the upgrades, as Jay pointed out, the early access customers have been getting higher throughput than maybe we advertised, that might also create new demand -- incremental demand for upgrades.","Jay T. Flatley","And one other thing we might mention that we didn't include in the script is that all MiSeq that ship out of the factory in Q3 and later will be the enhanced MiSeq. So we finish shipping all of the prior generation of MiSeq at the end of Q2.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So all -- the array business looks like it had a little bit of a resurgence this quarter. Could you just talk about it? Is this just a tick up in the studies? Is this share gains? Can you just put a little bit more color on the array market? And also kind of put it in scenes of what you see in terms of converting expression arrays to RNA-Seq and how it kind of fits with the whole exome kind of analysis.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I mean, there's a lot of factors at work here. We would characterize the array business overall as roughly flat. We had a positive trend on the instrument side during the quarter in the array business. In terms of the sub pockets of that business, I think whole genome association type chips are trending downward, but that's made up for by the positive trend lines in the exome chip, where we continue to have tremendous success. And we don't put that in the whole genome category. We put that in our focus category, and we've had really positive trend lines from some of the Ag chips as well, and the custom business continues to do well. So I think you can think of those factors roughly as netting out in Q2.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And talking about your services business and 3500 genomes, it's like what's the pricing looking like in that? And it's like, how do we think about the order book for that? Are you seeing more outsourcing? Are you picking up more contracts? Just can you talk about this? Particularly as you kind of launch new products, you're going to need faster turnaround.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we're seeing a lot of those genomes come in that are cancer genomes. And actually a fairly high percentage are from cancer sites. And many of these are nontraditional sequencing centers, so they're places that you wouldn't typically expect to have installations of 5 or 10 HiSeqs. The other kind of deal we see are ones that want relatively fast turnaround and don't have an existing infrastructure. So they don't want to buy instruments and take 6 months to set up a sequencing factory. They want to get all their samples in and turned around in 3 or 4 months, and I think that's driving it in part. In terms of pricing, it's probably down a little bit in overall ASP from what we saw over the past couple of quarters, but I think it's beginning to flatten out some.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And just want to clarify on the -- I just want a little bit more color on the MiSeq business. So you have seen the 2 by 250 sample kit coming in for MiSeq. I guess is that for the version 2 system, the version 1 systems? I'm just -- and sort of what's the turnaround time inclusive of sample prep for running that?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. It runs on the version 2 system. The overall runtime of the sequencer, Christian, you know that number is?","Christian O. Henry","It's over 24 hours, I think. Yes.","Jay T. Flatley","So it's not 20?","Christian O. Henry","It's not 20. We don't even know exactly but it's --","Jay T. Flatley","40? We're getting a signal that it's 40 hours.","Christian O. Henry","40.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay.","Christian O. Henry","We get the 2500 in 27 hours and the upgrade of MiSeq in 48 hours.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. So we've increased the cycle times on the MiSeq too, so it goes -- per cycle it goes faster, but there's a lot more cycles here so...","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, 250, right. So -- and I guess also on the MiSeq, I mean, you said that some of the instrumentation slowed down -- the instrumentation revenue decreased sequentially due to the backlog coming out there. Can you quantify that?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I can qualify it. I'm not sure I can quantify it for you. But so what happened, obviously, we had -- we're taking orders for a couple of quarters before we began shipping. And as we're ramping the manufacturing lines, we began to whittle down that backlog. But in the first quarter, we started shipping it. The incoming order rate was about equal to what we shipped, so we actually didn't make a lot of progress on getting the backlog reduced. And over the subsequent 2 quarters, we did that. And in Q1, we came out of that quarter with sort of a normalized backlog and had just a normal Q2 in terms of what we'd expect, where the shipments about match the incoming order rate. But we actually had a great order quarter from MiSeqs as well, so it's continuing to grow. And we're now in a place where we can deliver MiSeqs in a kind of time frame that our customers expect. And as we said during the time with the HiSeqs, customers don't want to wait 2.5 months to get these instruments, so we want to deliver them in 4 weeks or so, sometimes a little less if we can.","Yes, I think the key metric is increasing MiSeq orders each quarter. That's the key metric.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to wanted to walk through, Jay, your initial comments kind of on the sequester and sort of the state of funding in the U.S. I think the growing view at least on the Wall Street side of things, I think on the political side of things is there's a high probability at least this sequester will come into some place Gen 1 starting next year. The question is more sort of the length of period that which it's actually in place and then readjust it to kind of a new normal budgetary environment. Assuming that, that is a scenario, how do you think customers start to respond from a purchasing perspective in the back half of the year? And what's the sort of differential in terms of how you would expect a large versus a small customer to sort of swallow the potential temporary change in the environment?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I mean, what we think is going to happen is that we're going to come out of this year, fiscal year, so the beginning of October with a continuing resolution into Q4 because any chance of us having any real budget is close to 0, I think. And so if there's going to be some continuing resolution that's probably going to have a negative number in it. And what that is anybody's guess, but that there will probably be some controlled spending in that continuing resolution through Q4. And probably nothing's going to happen until after the election. And so that'll continue through the time frame. And then depending upon who gets selected, we'll have some budget resolution we think in the first month or 2 of Q1, of calendar Q1 2013. What happens between January 1 and when we actually get a budget? I don't know. I guess there's a chance it go to the 8% sequestration. But I'd be surprised. I would guess that whatever the continuing resolution is, we're going to continue all the way through to the point where we have a real budget.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Maybe it's a nuance, but the difference in the actual core budget and the sequesters are sort of 2 separate entities, right? So to the degree, the sequester occurs that sort of on top of whatever happens with the budget. And so that is an automatic cut until the Congress does something to relieve it. And so I guess what I'm trying to say, let's just assume that, that will be the magnitude. I mean, how do you think customers start to react? Do you think your customer would preference certain types of research? Because it only affects new grant cycles, correct? It wouldn't obviously affect the legacy grants. I'm just trying to get a sense from a risk-profile perspective, like what do you think the order of operations is for a lab manager of one of your typical customers in terms of having to adjust to an environment that could be strained even for a small period of time.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. Well, I think they would get a little more conservative during that window because they'd be worried -- even though they're working off existing grants, they'd be worried about how much future money they're going to get and would be thinking about potentially stretching it out. We think that's already happening to some extent. And I think our customers are thinking about that issue today, not all of them, but quite a number of them are and are sort of metering out the dollars in anticipation of a little bit of disruption in the back half.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just sort of the backlog commentary, I know you don't want to give too much. But just so understand at least from like a MiSeq modeling perspective. So the way to think about is sort of like what happened with HiSeq. We've now gone through most of the backlog. Were getting now to kind of the new normal level of placements. And then Christian's comment, the key to sort of lodge will be the sequential improvement, order rates, which will now sort if drive the instrument growth sequentially. Is that sort of the right way to think about it?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, yes, that certainly. But also the increasing reagents because of the growth of the install base will be accurate.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","No, I'm just thinking from a capital equipment perspective. So we sort of gotten the new normal and now we've got to grow sequentially vis-\u00e0-vis orders versus there being a significant backlog in effect.","Jay T. Flatley","That's right. And the one thing to think about there, we didn't include in any of our prepared remarks, but if you look at the mix of MiSeq orders to date, the vast majority of these are single unit orders. I mean, very, very high percentage. And what that means is that we have lots of customers who are developing assays, developing clinical tests, setting up research protocols on these units. And what we expect to see are the beginnings of repeat orders from those customers as they begin to fill up MiSeq number 1 and move on to MiSeq 2 or 3. And so the need to continue to find new customers is not quite as high to continue to grow that number because of that beginnings of the repeat business which we think we still have.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This question, Jay, just to, I guess, the risk of beating a dead horse here on spending. I just want to, I guess, elaborate a little bit on the comment regarding not seeing a lot of pressure here. Can you talk at all whether or not you're seeing any re-prioritization? In other words, reemphasizing consumables versus seeing new instrumentation and all?","Jay T. Flatley","No, we haven't. I ping our sales VP every week now on this looking for any early warning signals of changes in customer behavior, and were just not seeing it yet. And maybe it's too early because I think they feel probably pretty good with respect to what's going to happen through the end of Q3 -- or the end of Q4, I mean, -- Q4 fiscal, so our Q3. And there might be a little bit more effect in Q4. But so far, we're just not seeing any changes in customer behavior. We're certainly on the lookout for it.","Marc Stapley","Of course, the way we look at our sales model, it's based on the current funding opportunities. And when you look at a product like MiSeq, the funnel is very strong.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then just thinking a little bit about sort of MiSeqs that are going outside of academia. Do we have enough data points at this stage to talk about what the utilization looks like within this customer base as compared to, say, each of your core academic group?","Jay T. Flatley","I don't think it would be very meaningful yet. And the reason is that many of those are going to clinical accounts where they're in the stage where they're doing the clinical research work, they're not actually running them in a production environment yet. And so I don't think that -- I don't have those numbers at my fingertips, but even if I did, I don't think they'd be necessarily indicative of what that segment will get to, say, a year from now.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then just last quick one for me. It's just regarding the comment around the customers that you've signed on to receiving periodic orders on the consumable side, so as to avoid the price increase, can you talk at all to what extent that'll influence the back half of the year? To what extent that you've you been able to say -- communicate that as a percentage of what your overall consumables expectations will be?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I'd say of the total consumables for the next 6 months, it's not a significant fraction of that total. But it's something that helps us forecast, and it also tends to be something that occurred obviously more with our larger customers. So it gives us visibility on the behavior of those bigger customers. And that's quite useful, and they're the ones that perhaps were the most interested in avoiding this price increase.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question starting with HiSeq. I believe in the past, you've talked about maybe 25% to 30% of the HiSeq user base expected to be upgrading to the 2500. Is that still the case? Since it looks like certainly in the new orders, you're seeing a very high percentage of those take the option to upgrade. I just want to get a sense of how we should think about the user base upgrading and over what time frame that's reasonable?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. The numbers we've given previously were more speculative and sort of had to do with what we thought might happen without many data points. And we now have some data points that look like they're falling about on that line. So I think this idea of 25% to 30%, call it, in the next year is probably about the right number. As I did mention, once we start shipping the 2500, then the price increase or to upgrade is going to go up, and it's going to go up pretty significantly. So we could have a situation where we get some -- a rush of upgrade orders before that price increase and then the upgrade slowdown afterwards.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the pull-through. I know you mentioned on the prepared remarks how the pull-through on the 2500 would be greater than kind of what you're currently generating on the 2000. what's the kind of appropriate guidepost to think about on the 2500 pull-through on an annualized basis?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, that's pretty hard to know right now, I guess. Because there's -- people will use the 2500 in different ways. If they run it all out in rapid mode versus what they would do traditionally, you might think of it being about 20% higher. But that may not be how people use them because, particularly in the large centers, we'll have some mix of 2500s and 2000s. And so they may run all the fast stuff through the 2500 and then leave it idle and run the big stuff, the longer runs on the 2000 to make sure they're free if they get a hot sample and that they have to run. And so it's hard for us to figure out in advance what that equation might look like.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe one more quick one. Just on your ovarian sequencing program when we're out -- Christian and Marc, earlier in the spring, we kind of asked what sort of timing for an update on that program. Just wanted to see if there's any more clarity on when you would expect to provide investment information on that program?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We think the next check in point of that will probably be in the fall.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nandita Koshal with Barclays.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Jay, firstly, I was wondering if you've seen a meaningful step up in your services business associated with a faster turnaround due to the 2500?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I'd say not yet, and a couple reasons for that. One, it's a little early since we announced it pretty recently. The second reason is that when we announced it, we announced a limited capacity because we didn't want to load up our services lab with a lot of 2500s until we understand what the market demand is. So I don't recall it exactly what the number is, but I think we announced 5 a week?","Christian O. Henry","5 to 10 I think it was.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, 5 to 10 a week is the maximum we could do. And so that's the most we would book. So it's not a high percentage in the overall samples. And we're going to use that here for the first couple of months. We get assessment of how big the market demand is on the RUO side. And we will launch this into CLIA, and then we'll start adding 2500s to track the market demand. So for those reasons, I think it's too early to really understand what the total demand might look like.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And is that your expectation that the CLIA part of it will really drive demand in that business, not really the RUO side?","Jay T. Flatley","I think the CLIA will become more important, yes.","Christian O. Henry","Those are the types of genomes where there's a medical reason for it to be rushed through. And there are a great many cases per RUO genomes as well but I think there are fewer than the clinical cases.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Because it's going back to Ross' earlier point about how customers might be thinking about dealing with the uncertainty in the back half. Could they be thinking about service as a more viable option given the faster turnaround now, versus actually buying instruments and consumables? Would that be an option to sort of deal with?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, they could, but the faster turnaround cost more per genome. So the economics aren't in their favor there. I mean, it's variable cost, so they don't have to put out the capital. But it overall spends more money with -- per genome with Illumina. So I'd be surprised if too many customers make that decision. Some might.","Christian O. Henry","Also, Jay, the product offering is a lot more narrow relative to what customers are doing. So on a rapid turnaround, it's really just whole genome sequencing and human only. So -- and if you look at what the majority of our customers are doing with their sequencers, it's everything from exome -- it's some whole genome. But I wouldn't say that's the dominant application right now. It's exome, RNA, small -- other small -- smaller types of projects are the key drivers of consumable pull.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Thanks, Christian. And if you could also comment on the competitive landscape that you're expecting in the second half in early 2013, obviously some new product launches coming up from competitors as well. Could you talk about those assumptions on you end? And then R&D priorities for Illumina, just what we can look forward to by the way of new product launches, apart from the ones that you already announced?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I guess we haven't seen a lot of change in the competitive dynamics, maybe a little less competition on the services side. The products that have been preannounced aren't in the marketplace yet really, and so there's no real change in what we expected there. So we continue to believe we're going to be very competitive, particularly if you started looking at the MiSeq performing at the kind of levels that we talked about with these sample prep and ease-of-use and the BaseSpace attached to it. We think that's going to be a very competitive product in the overall market. In terms of new products, we obviously don't talk specifically about those. But we are working across the board, and you've seen us do a lot of innovative things in the informatics side. You'll continue to see that. We're clearly working very hard across the set of platforms that we have to enhance those. We're working on new generation technologies and various sorts. And we've had great success in our program to back-integrating the sample prep. And I think you'll continue to see us do that in a very aggressive way. And over time, the sample prep will become increasingly integrated with the system, particularly as we drive these products into clinical markets where ease-of-use and push-button operation is more and more important.","Marc Stapley","And indeed, it's not just one comment on the competitive landscape. I mean our current outlooks reflect the known competitive situation. So anything we get back from our sales team that sweep through the funnel reflects what they know about what we know about what's currently been announced.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to, first off, try to address that question of visibility a little bit more directly. I'm wondering if you could simply say if book-to-bill was in fact greater or less than one this quarter?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We're not going to disclose it this quarter, Isaac. And it's -- and you can read anything into that. I mean it really is just that we don't want to get into a pattern where it's expected that we disclose book-to-bill every quarter. We've done it twice, and we don't want to be in the habit of feeling like we have to do that. We do report our backlog at the end of the year, so you'll see that in our K at the end of the year. And so you can make a year-to-year comparison about book-to-bill when we publish that.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. Fair enough. And then secondly, on PCR, just wondering if you could maybe try and frame on the long-term kind of how you're going to measure success. On the one hand, the technology you have is obviously priced aggressively and applicable to a very large install base of systems. For the side, the incumbent is very well established. So if you could maybe put a timeline on how you how long you're looking at kind of measuring success and what those terms might look like?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I think we need to look at this as a long-term investment on our part. So we'll measure success over a period of a couple of years. It is going to take some changes in our distribution channel, which we've implemented internationally and have yet to do at the level we would like in the U.S. but I think we're close to getting that done. And so I think we're going to need to give that distribution channel some time to ramp up. It's not going to be as quick as our direct distribution channels typically would be for a new product. And so I think we'll measure success over probably the next 2 years. And we need to have good reach to sell these products because they're sold in high volumes into lots of labs and not typically the places that-- where all direct sales people would've called otherwise. And that's why the distribution model works well here. Hopefully, it will work well, as well as having lower ASPs where you can justify direct sales.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Terrific. One last question for me. It's a big picture one on MiSeq. It's been in the market almost a year now. And I'm just wondering if you could give us an updated view on how you frame the large -- the long-term market opportunity for that product cycle. And the reason I ask is I think most of us have tried to ballpark it. I think somewhere between the HiSeq market opportunity and then the PCR market. Obviously, that's a very wide range. So given the updated way that you're looking at the framework for the market there, that would be super helpful.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I can say that we're very bullish on MiSeq and its future incarnations and derivatives of that platform. We've made great technological progress going from a HiSeq to a MiSeq and we're going to continue to drive all aspects of the chemistry in the optical performance of the system. So we think that if you think about the overall market opportunity here over some period of years, in this category of desktop instruments, it's certainly in the range of 10,000 plus whether it's 20,000 we could argue about, but we think it's certainly in that 10,000 range at a minimum.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","How are you thinking about the impact of foreign currency on your business in the second half of the year?","Marc Stapley","Dan, it's Marc here. We've -- obviously, we don't forecast what we think is going to happen with the FX rate. We do have a fairly natural hedge when you take into account where our cost structure is, particularly with the U.K.'s R&D and presence in the Singapore manufacturing. And when you look across our P&L, it nets out that's up pretty nicely, the currency is moving the direction they have been lately but we just don't know where it's going to go in the future. And we have a fairly tried-and-tested hedging strategy, which is pretty basic -- it's pretty simple. It's not overly sophisticated, but it's been working us lately. The effectively -- in the past, the last couple quarters have been material for us both to revenue and bottom line. So I can't tell you what it's going to look like going forward but we'll continue to track it the way we are and see if we can offset and mitigate some of the impacts.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay, thanks. And Marc, can you comment on the technology write-down, if that was in anyway related to chemistry A or chemistry B?","Marc Stapley","No. I mean, it wasn't. The technology write-down was an asset that we acquired a couple of years ago and it's not related to the DNA sequencing space.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my final question, what do you think your attach rate looks like in the sample prep business? So what proportion of your sequencing or incremental sequencing in cells are using your enrichment products as opposed to competitors?","Jay T. Flatley","I think our estimates now are somewhere in the 40% to 50% range of the client sample prep. A little hard to know exactly but we think that's the range and part of the problem is that there's some homebrew stuff going on, as well as stuff supplied by other competitors. And our goal clearly is to continue to take market share there. One thing I might add on the prior question as well is that, what happened with this technology write-down is that we go through every year multiple times when we look at our product portfolio and our research portfolio and decide how to prioritize products in that collection of opportunities. And in this particular technology, we decided to lower the priority enough that we decided that we needed to impair the asset because it has less clear visibility for getting to the market and that's the reason we impaired it.","Marc Stapley","Yes. Just to punctuate that, I mean, we're not abandoning that asset. We're just reprioritizing our focus.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess just getting into the MiSeq opportunity a bit further, Jay. Can you give us a sense for the level of the replacement that you're doing with the MiSeq at this point?","Jay T. Flatley","I don't actually have those numbers at my fingertips so I would say, anecdotally, maybe a little less than what we thought but our Amplicon product is starting to pick up steam, and that's really the market that -- or the sample prep methodology that goes after the biggest part of the CE market. So we continue to think that over time, those are going to get largely displaced in other than the sticky applied markets. But there are customers that are slow to change. They've got a process has been working for them for a while, and we need to just show them why this is so much more economical and so much easier to use than CE. So we're doing okay there but probably a little less than we might have anticipated.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I guess are you able to talk a bit about the launch plan for the targeted panels that you're looking to offer for MiSeq? How often might customers be looking at new products and maybe what are the key focus areas there from that area to these perspective or genome region perspective?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, let me talk about that in general terms that we have quite a number of -- well, what we have a number of panels that we think we'll have in the market by the end of this year and those we marketed through our TCG group to existing CLIA laboratories for the most part, and these will be enabling panels that will allow these CLIA labs to go after specific disease areas. In some cases, they can add their own content to the panels but you think of them as enabling more our customers. And then the other kinds of panels are the ones that come out of our Greg's pure diagnostics business where there are actually products that will run our cells, and that's where we're putting the MiSeq through the FDA with our own panel in Illumina market directly.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe if I could sneak in just one more higher-level question. I guess as clinically usage gets going, how do you get to the industry standard for reporting and quality on the assays that will be run? Is that something that you think is a key hurdle and -- is there something that you can do there to help that process along?","Jay T. Flatley","You mean to actually achieve quality that's necessary or to convince people that the qualities were it needs to be or...","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, just in terms of getting the customer base comfortable with the reproducibility of results and the standardization of what they're getting off from the machine?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. Well, I guess the first thing is we're going through a number of clinical trials on MiSeq and that certainly is going to help as we publish the results of those clinical trials. It's going to certainly help with the ability to -- for publications in front of customers that show that reproducibility. We are putting them in front of the FDA as well so the FDA hopefully will put their stamp of approval on this system as analytically producing reliable and repeatable results, and then for the specific assays we've put on, and that those assays have clinical utility. We're working with the FDA across a broad front here to make sure that sequencing gets moved forward quickly, and I think the FDA is very on board with this idea and that they want to have sequencers approved and to demonstrate that these machines are reliable, that they do produce accurate results and in many cases, more accurate results than any of the existing technologies do. And I think as we get through that point at the end of the year, I think it's going to become pretty clear that these platforms are clinically ready.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Jay, the strong service revenue, what's behind that? Is that whole genome sequencing or race? Could you break that down out in anyway?","Jay T. Flatley","That's a combination of, yes, whole genome sequencing which was good during the quarter, some array contracts and also a result of our growing install base and the services revenue that we get from the maintenance contracts.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And then across the customer base, are you seeing a resurgence in whole exome sequencing versus whole genome sequencing?","Jay T. Flatley","Not sure I'd characterize that as a resurgence. I mean, it certainly has been a strong, growing market segment and I think it continues to grow. If you look at the trade-off between exome and whole genome, you'll find people in both camps and it's largely an economics question and a question around the power of the type of study that they want to conduct. So if you're looking for certain characteristics or certain types of discoveries, you can do a whole lot more samples with exome, and that may be the better design if you want to a pure hypothesis free study and you want to look everywhere and the whole genome is the only way to go, but it will cost more per sample and therefore, your study will be less powered from a sample perspective. So I think over time, as we've said over and over that we think the exome market is a good one but will become less and less of a factor if you look out 2, 3, 4 years because the sample prep will become more a dominant cost on the front end for exome sequencing compared to whole genome and therefore, the economic gap will shrink.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And do you find at the moment, there's any difference in profitability between whole exome sequences and whole genome sequences in the sense of downtime and the difference in the front end prep?","Jay T. Flatley","In terms of our profitability?","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Jay T. Flatley","I don't think so. We've probably -- let's see, let me think about that. So in the exome case, we have a little more sample prep revenue because if they're using our exome prep kit, but the per sample cost on the sequencer is less because you can multiplex so many of the other side. We'd have to work that out to see what the relative profitability actually is between those. I don't -- I can't do that math in my head.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.","Adam Darity","This is Adam in for Amit. I just had a question on the 2500 rollout strategy. How should we be thinking about that to the top account, and what's the latest details you can give us?","Jay T. Flatley","We expect to begin shipping in Q4 and we also expect to start putting out the upgrade kits probably around the end of Q4. So the upgrades to the install base. And as we mentioned, many of the -- or most of the incoming orders are for 2500s or 2000s with upgrade kits. So we'll start shipping those new units at the early part of Q4.","Adam Darity","Okay. And then I know you've commented on your end market mix changing, becoming more commercial and that was lending better visibility for you. Can you quantitate that or quantify that more or give more detail on where those trends are going?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We're working hard to get a better database on this so that we can do a better job of knowing exactly where these systems are going. In some cases, for example in distributors sales, we don't have as good information as we might like. We've historically -- if you look back a year or 2, talked about it being about 80% in the academic markets and 20% into sort of commercial and nonacademic sorts of sites. We think that's probably down to 70% now, maybe trending a little bit lower than that but we're doing a little bit more analysis now to make sure we have those numbers right. Certainly, the incoming order rate is biasing more and more toward nonacademic accounts. So our overall exposure there is being reduced.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just stepping back a little bit, how much of your total consumable sales would you say are going into the clinical end markets today, and how fast would you say that stream is growing?","Jay T. Flatley","Let's see, what can I say? I would guess -- I don't have those numbers specifically so this is an estimate. If you want the actual number, you can call us back later and we'll do the math. But I would guess it's about 10% going into clinical markets, and we have a couple of very rapidly growing customers who have fully commercial tests in the market that now have a large install base of HiSeqs. If you look across the T21 testing market, there's 5 companies all using our platform. A number of these are commercially running tests every day now. So it's growing quite quickly and I'd say at a much faster rate than the research consumables are growing but I'm not sure we've actually calculated it in that sort of segment.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. So would you say half that 10% is attributed to some of those prenatal companies?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I don't think we'd give a specific number on that, and I don't know what the number is so -- but all I can say that, that segment is starting to grow. I mean, the orders are clearly coming in there, and those companies are ramping.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Great. And just to clarify, the kind of lab question, Jay. So the breakdown of current MiSeq orders is, there's an overrepresentation of nonacademic accounts, is that fair?","Jay T. Flatley","That's right. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Knight with BLSA (sic) [CLSA].","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Could you talk about your international exposure and when would we expect that tax rate to finally drop?","Jay T. Flatley","International exposure with respect to overall orders or were you thinking about with respect to the tax rate?","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, Jay, as PEAR as they have grown their Asian operations, for example, tax rates have drop, would you expect that?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, we would. So Asia has been particularly strong for us over the past few quarters. Europe has been okay. Americas over the last 2 quarters at least is growing pretty nicely. So on a relative revenue basis, I'd say at least in Q2, the Americas was a higher proportion of the revenue. But certainly, as that mix shifts toward Asia, or if it shifts toward Asia, we would have an improved tax rate. Marc, you want to talk about sort of our expectation on how it will reduce over time?","Marc Stapley","Yes, Paul, I mean, we've -- as you've pointed out, we've been growing our operations in Asia and Singapore in particular. We've been moving manufacturing there at a reasonable rate and particularly are focused around our consumable manufacturing. And so that's helping us to improve our tax structure but we're going to continue down that path. We're looking at not only that but as obviously every other, in fact, opportunity that we might have, and -- but that's absolutely one of the levers we can pull and we'll continue to pull it in the future. I wouldn't want to try and give any guidance around what the tax rate might look like but I would expect to decline going forward.","Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes, is this going to help your margin expansion? Or is it just implied?","Marc Stapley","I think, yes. I mean, a little bit, yes. Yes, I think it should.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the time that we have available for questions.

We\u2019ve had a great start to 2018 with revenue of $782 million, up 31% from the first quarter of 2017. As we celebrate our 28th birthday this month, these results highlight the vision, commitment and execution of the entire Illumina family. At the same time it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re in the earliest stages of the genomics journey, we\u2019re only just beginning to see how Illumina and our customers will inform and transform patient lives.","Illumina is proud to be part of this genomics revolution that is building momentum, while our achievements in the first 20 years have been impressive, the opportunity for Illumina and our customers in the next 20 years looks even more exciting. Reflecting strong demand for sequencing consumables, first quarter revenue of $417 million grew 31% from the same quarter a year ago. This performance was driven by consumables growth across our sequencing portfolio with notable strength in our high throughput family, which grew 34%.","As anticipated, consumables from our HiSeq family declined as customers transitioned to NovaSeq. So HiSeq consumables were down about $20 million sequentially, primarily among our ex-customers. Excluding the $19 million stocking order in the fourth quarter, NovaSeq consumables grew approximately 60% sequentially with strong performance from both the S2 and S4 flow cells. The S1 flow cell which we officially launched at AGBT in mid-February has received great customer feedback, and is expected to ramp throughout 2018.","NextSeq delivered another strong quarter with consumables up about 40% from last year and an average pull-through rate at the high end of the $100,000 to $150,000 range. MiniSeq and MiSeq consumables both contributed to the growth on a sequential and year-over-year basis with pull-through within their expected ranges. Library prep grew 20% from the first quarter of 2017 and represents more than 10% of our sequencing consumable business.","We\u2019re very pleased to see consumable growth across our entire instrument portfolio. It\u2019s an important reminder that while NovaSeq is a key enabler for some of our customers. The growth in sequencing demand more broadly is a key driver of our business. On the research side for example, NIH funding of immuno-oncology studies has been growing at 11% over the last five years. Within those studies, sequencing based I\/O studies have been growing more than 40% from the prior year.","We\u2019re also seeing growing interest in single cell research and our customers are among the 500 scientists, contributing to the Human Cell Atlas initiative that aims to transform biological research in medicine by characterizing every cell type in the human body. Commercially, sequencing volume growth is driven across a broad range of applications and platforms. In oncology, it's clear that even ahead of the recent CMS National Coverage Determination on NGS testing our customers are seeing mounting awareness and acceptance of NGS-based panels.","These tests like those offered by Foundation and Guardant are leading to increase demand for sequencing consumables. There is also a huge amount of interest in immuno-oncology, growing testing outside the U.S., including China, and building momentum in liquid biopsy which offers the promise of less invasive earlier cancer detection. NIPT, grew both sequentially and year-over-year, driven by our very VeriSeq CE-IVD product, which continues to gain traction outside the U.S.","The Netherlands program is in its earlier stages of its ramp and is expected to contribute to a VeriSeq sales more than doubling in 2018. In the U.S. we launched a new study with Harvard Pilgrim to collect data to demonstrate the clinical and economic value of NIPT for average risk patients.","We firmly believe that all pregnant women should be able to choose NIPT and our goal is to enable the high-quality data needed by payers to expand average risk coverage from today's 40%.","Also in the first quarter, we launched the [MiSeq] study to demonstrate the clinical utility of whole genome sequencing for acutely ill newborns with rare and undiagnosed genetic disease or rugged. Similar to the Harvard Pilgrim study this is another example of Illumina actively investing in innovative programs to support broader adoption and reimbursement of sequencing in the clinic over time.","While still early days, we we're seeing growing adoption of whole exome and whole genome sequencing for rugged patients. This is an area where early testing can redirect treatment and even save lives. Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Florida just announced that it is partnering with Rady here in San Diego to offer whole genome sequencing for very sick children with undiagnosed diseases, and spanning research and clinical, we're seeing growing demand among our service customers to include sequencing among their offerings.","In summary, the trajectory of our sequencing consumables business is very exciting, highlighting the growing adoption of sequencing across a broad range of customers and applications. Our commitment is to enable customers to sequence as much as they need to with the highest quality consumables on the system with the economics and workflow that makes the most sense for them.","Reflecting our broad portfolio of instruments, sequencing system revenue was a $112 million in the first quarter of 2018, that's up 18% from the first quarter of 2017 and down sequentially, as we expected given the normal capital equipment seasonality. First quarter NovaSeq shipments were down sequentially as we expected with order and shipment volumes consistent with our belief that the NovaSeq upgrade cycle will span multiple years.","As we continue to see good uptick from new to Illumina or straight from benchtop customers with about 25% of NovaSeq orders coming from this group in the first quarter. NovaSeq interest from our current high throughput customers remained strong. We surveyed our HiSeq and HiSeq X customers during the quarter and the responses we received further reinforced our conviction in the multiyear transition to NovaSeq. Across our benchtop platforms, we saw another quarter of strong adoption by new to sequencing customers who represented approximately 50% of our benchtop shipments in the first quarter.","NextSeq remains an important platform for a broad set of customers and markets, including the clinical oncology applications just announced with BMS and Loxo Oncology that will run on the NextSeqDX. Lastly, we launched our iSeq platform in the first quarter and shipped units to customers for beta testing. During the beta test, we identified some opportunities to improve our corporate billing and shipping processes that will enhance product robustness and reliability.","We are in the process of validating these improvements and expect to scale shipments midyear. In the meantime, we continue to see strong interest in iSeq and are approaching 100 orders. Illumina will continue to be an important enabler and innovator of sequencing broadly through the system and consumables we bring to market. In addition, we\u2019ve a number of strategic initiatives that we believe will accelerate the adoption of sequencing and consumer and clinical applications and drive future growth.","In population genomics, Illumina continues to enable some of the most exciting programs around the world. We include the genomics England initiative, which is now halfway through its 100,000 genome target and hopes to complete sequencing all 100,000 genomes this year. After that, the program aims to start using clinical whole genome sequencing for rare disease diagnosis and management of certain cancers.","In the U.S., the almost $3 billion increase in NIH funding for 2018 included $219 million for the all of our precision medicine initiative, which is expected to launch later this year. The genomics working group recently recommended that the program includes both arrays and whole genome sequencing. The detailed plan for the million participants is being finalized, but the program will get started with the pilot of 20,000 participants later this year.","While not our population genomics initiative, I also want to highlight that the UK Biobank announced that it will be sequencing 50,000 whole genomes over the next two years. This effort is being funded by the Medical Research Council and conducted by the Wellcome Sanger Institute using Illumina technology. Ultimately, the goal is to sequence all 500,000 samples in the UK Biobank building on the exome sequencing project that is currently underway.","Oncology represents one of the most exciting opportunities in sequencing and Illumina is participating in two ways. First, we are investing and partnering to create distributable companion diagnostics for a broad range of Illumina customers and their patients. Additionally to access to our technology, we enable customers to develop their own oncology tests and applications.","Our recent announcements with Loxo Oncology and Bristol-Myers Squibb are the first examples of collaborations, intended to deliver clinically actionable sequencing based diagnostics that enable precision medicine for oncology patients. We\u2019re partnering with Loxo Oncology to gain approval for our TruSight Tumor 170 test as a companion diagnostic for two of their pan-cancer drug candidates, larotrectinib and LOXO-292.","With BMS, we are working on companion diagnostic version of our TruSight Oncology 500 to measure biomarkers including TMB that may predict whether patients will respond to their immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors. Cancer patients may not have multiple chances to receive the right combination of drugs, so companion diagnostics must be accurate and reproducible. And our objective is to offer distributable companion diagnostics to provide end-to-end workflows, including NextSeq Dx.","This will allow labs to accurately and reproducibly test patients so that physicians can select the most effective cancer therapy at initial diagnosis. These collaborations are very timely given the recent coverage decisions which demonstrate how the regulatory and reimbursement environment is progressing. We are very pleased to see these meaningful developments that will accelerate clinical adoption of NGS and allow more patients to benefit from sequencing.","Consumer genomics is another area where the regulatory environment is making progress to accommodate genomic capabilities. In March, 23andMe was granted the first FDA authorization for a direct to consumer genetic test for cancer risk. This highlights the agency support for individuals accessing their genetic information in a responsible manner. Clearly, this authorization broadens the opportunity for personal genome companies to enable consumers to engage far more directly in their own health. It promises to be a very interesting area to watch overtime.","Building on the direct-to-consumer inflection we saw in 2017, our microarray business had a spectacular start to 2018 with 48% growth to a record $152 million. Microarray service revenue doubled to $58 million from the same quarter a year ago and grew 81% sequentially. Microarray consumables grew 26% from last year to 87% which was higher than expected. Given the impressive ramp here, I'd like to thank our microarray team that delivered this rapid growth in both our microarray consumables and services.","Finally, I'd like to welcome Phil Febbo, who recently joined Illumina as our Chief Medical Officer. Phil previously served as CMO of Genomic Health and will be responsible for leading our medical strategy to drive genomic testing into clinical practice. This is clearly one of Illumina's highest priorities and we are confident we found the right person to execute in the opportunity ahead.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Sam, for a review of our quarterly financials. Sam?","Sam Samad","Thanks, Francis. As discussed, first quarter revenue grew 31% year-over-year to $782 million driven largely by growth in sequencing consumables that once again exceeded forecast as well as strong performance in both microarray and sequencing services. Additionally, benefit from foreign exchange rates contributed 3% to the year-over-year growth.","Geographically, Americas grew revenue 27% versus the prior year period driven by strong growth in both sequencing instruments and consumables. EMEA grew 50% due to broad strength across the sequencing business, highlighting strong progress and execution in the region. Asia Pacific grew 21% overall with 38% shipment growth in greater China.","Revenue from sequencing instruments grew 18% year-over-year to $112 million driven by NovaSeq and offset in part by lower shipments of the HiSeqs family of instruments as expected. Microarray instrument revenue was $6 million up 10% year-over-year. Total instrument revenue was therefore $118 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year and represented 15% of total revenue.","As Francis noted, first quarter sequencing consumable revenue was $417 million, up 31% from last year. Microarray consumable revenue of $87 million was up 26%. Total consumable revenue of $504 million grew 30% from last year and represented 65% of total revenue. First quarter total product revenue which includes freight was $628 million up 28% from the year ago quarter. Service and other was $164 million, up 44% from the same quarter last year driven by strength in genotyping services due to consumer demand as well as sequencing services and instrument maintenance contract.","Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our non-GAAP results, which includes stock based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's earnings release and supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to the Illumina shareholders.","As expected, non-GAAP good morning of 69.8% was lower compared to the fourth quarter primarily due to mix with microarrays contributing 19% of overall revenue compared to 16% last quarter. Year-over-year gross margin increased 340 basis points primarily due to favorable mix. We also did not see the negative impact associated with the one-time inventory transition reserve that we experienced in the prior year period.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were up slightly from last year at $360 million, but lower than expected due to the timing of headcount additions and associated benefits as well as the timing of certain investments and the favorable judgment on the patent suit. Compared to last quarter, the 9 million increase largely reflects higher stock-based compensation and expected increase in payroll taxes.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.5%, down 31.4% last quarter reflecting the slightly lower gross margin and increased OpEx. Excluding Helix, operating margin was 31.9% compared to 33.9% in the fourth quarter. Operating margin increased from the 17.5% in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to improved gross margin and lower operating expenses in relation to sales.","The non-GAAP tax rate of 12.9% compares to 18% last quarter and to 24.4% in the first quarter of 2017. In addition to tax reform, Q1 benefited from the recognition of Helix losses attributable to Illumina following our cash investment of 68 million during the quarter. I will talk more about the Helix tax benefit in a moment. But excluding this one-time benefit, the non-GAAP tax rate was 18.4%.","For the first quarter of 2018, GAAP net income was 208 million or $0.41 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $214 million or $1.45 per diluted share. This was relatively flat compared to last quarter as lower gross margin and higher OpEx were more than offset by the favorable Helix contribution. The impact of foreign exchange rate increased Q1 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.07 relative to last year.","Operating expenses associated with Helix remained relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter. However there was a tax benefit to Illumina following our participation in the recent Series B financing round. As a result of our first cash investment, we recognized a one-time 12.7 million or $0.09 per share tax benefit for prior year Helix losses.","Excluding the tax impact, first quarter Helix dilution was about $0.06, flat with last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $255 million. Continued reductions in our collections cycle and improved revenue linearity led to a record DSO of 47 days, compared to 48 days last quarter. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $90 million and Q1 free cash flow was $165 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.4 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Moving to guidance, total company revenue is now expected to grow between 15% and 16% in 2018, an increase of 55 million at the midpoint compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance. In total, therefore, we are now expecting 2018 revenue in the range 3.17 billion and 3.19 billion.","As Francis discussed, we are very encouraged by the trends we are seeing in our sequencing consumable business. Our revised revenue guidance range therefore reflects the higher sequencing consumable and arrays revenue reported in Q1, an increase in the forecast for our sequencing consumables throughout the rest of 2018. Milestone payments associated with our recently announced oncology collaborations. These will be included in sequencing and other revenue.","And finally, no change to our expectations for 330 to 350 NovaSeq shipments this year, mix remains the primary driver of our gross margin and consistent with our prior guidance we continue to expect full-year non-GAAP gross margin to be up modestly from 2017. For 2018, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%, which factors in the Helix benefit and more favorable impact from tax reform and the more favorable geographic mix.","On a go forward basis for the remainder of the year and excluding the one-time Helix associated tax benefit we are projecting a non-GAAP tax rate around 20%, GAAP EPS is now expected to be between 445 and 455 and non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be between 475 and 485. This increase primarily reflects the higher revenue projection for the full year, the positive Helix tax benefit and the more favorable tax rate than previously projected.","Offsetting these items, we are planning some incremental R&D and commercial projects to capitalize on the momentum we are seeing in the business to drive future growth. We therefore now expect full year non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat to slightly up on a percentage of revenue basis from 2017. For the full year we are still expecting about $0.25 of Helix dilution. This excludes the previously mentioned tax benefit that resulted from our latest investment in Helix in Q1.","We expect share count for the full year to be approximately a 148 million. For the second quarter specifically, we expect modest sequential growth. We expect continued growth in our sequencing consumable and system businesses to be partially offset by a seasonal decline in our microarray business.","We expect gross margins to decline about a 100 basis points sequentially due to mix and higher costs associated with our pharma collaborations, and we expect operating expenses to be more in line with 2017 levels on a percentage of revenue basis given our expected hiring and investment plan.","Operator, we\u2019d now like to begin our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We do have questions in the queue, and the first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Francis, I want to maybe just jump in on the sequencing instrument number. I think that's really what most people are focusing in on. I know you had talked about it being down due to seasonality. I am just curious, was it 20 million decline here -- was that in line with your internal estimates? And can you maybe talk about some of the gives and takes, how much of it was HiSeq X, 10 dropping off versus maybe an elongated selling cycle for Nova as you start to push into that core 2,500 user base? And any early feedback you provide on trends among the 2,500 users that are now using the S1 chips?","Francis deSouza","Sure. I'd, overall, there\u2019s a sequencing instrument number came in within our expectation, so we knew coming into Q1 that we have the usual Q4, Q1 seasonality, and so there was no surprise associated with the number. We continue to be and I\u2019ll go through maybe some of the instrument specifics as you said. We continue to be very pleased with how the NovaSeq rollout is going, as you know we planned for this to be a rollout that played out over a number of years, and so to do that we were very intentional for example with how we rolled out the flow cells since the launch of NovaSeq.","And overall, it's playing out as we expect maybe slightly bit better. We are seeing good interest in upgrading to NovaSeq form the HiSeq customer base. That started to play out last year, starting first with our commercial customers and then in the second half of the year we started to see our academic customers start the upgrade cycle too. But as you know we closed out with only 15% of our 850 HiSeq and HiSeq X having brought their first NovaSeq. And so, that is a multi-year adoption cycle and it is playing that way. We also were happy to see the number of new tool Illumina and straight from benchtop customers that continue to drive about a quarter of the purchases of NovaSeq that played out again in Q1.","And that's exciting for us and we continue to see examples of new companies that we formed to take advantage of the fact that NovaSeq is really democratizing access to high throughput sequencing capabilities. So we saw customers from around the world. In Australia, there was a customer that was being formed to do cancer population screening. We saw another customer in China that brought a NovaSeq and was actually started to offer high throughput sequencing. And so that continues to play out.","Most importantly thought it was really exciting was to see the growth we're seeing sequencing consumables. And now with the trend that played out in Q1 across all our system portfolio. So we saw high throughput sequencing go up as we talked about, but we saw overall, sequencing consumables rise across the entire range. And as we talked about before, that's probably the most accurate reflection of the level of sequencing that's happening in the market. And as we talked about on the call that our variety of drivers across the clinical and research markets that's really driving that consumable demand across the entire portfolio.","Operator","The next question in queues comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","My question is on NovaSeq consumable pull-through. So last quarter, NovaSeq consumable revenue grew 80% sequentially and according to your prepared remarks last quarter that was excluding an $18 million stocking order. That stocking order was one of the key reasons you've told us to expect the Q1 revenue would be down up to $35 relative to Q4. Obviously that didn't happen and based on your prepared remarks, it appears that Q1 NovaSeq consumable revenue grew pretty robustly sequentially and that's even relative to a number that includes the stocking order in the base. By our math, it looks like annualized consumable spend for NovaSeq has been increasing pretty robustly every quarter since launch. And in the Q1, we're coming up with the annualized consumable pull-through number for NovaSeq that's at least around $700,000 per box maybe above $800,000. So my question is, I want to reiterate neighborhood on pull-through, two, how much of the how much is the release of the S1 and the S4 NXP increasing utilization? And is there any reason we shouldn't expect to continuation of the quarter-to-quarter improvement trend in annualized NovaSeq pull-through?","Francis deSouza","Sure, thanks Doug. So I'll start by saying that, yes, we did see really strong growth in NovaSeq consumables as we talked about on the call. And that's driven a broad range of applications including oncology testing for target therapies, oncology NIPT application expansion especially in China whole genome sequencing for rugged, large panels, liquid biopsy. So we're seeing a range of applications that's driving that really robust growth in NovaSeq consumable. We've also seen as I talked about on the call, some HiSeq customers then start to ramp down their spending on HiSeq and begin the transition over to NovaSeq.","There are still customers though that are continuing to run at HiSeq because they are clinical customers for example and it'll take them time to do the transition or you know they are in the midst of working through a sample cohort, and they don't want to switch instruments, you know, mid experiment. But you know we are seeing that transition start to happen, so we're seeing that the HiSeq consumables start to ramp down and NovaSeq really continue to build. At the end of you know, S1, it's out there assisting in a drive on demand and we expect to play out as we planned, so all of our flow cells are actually doing well and the instruments are performing well in the field and giving a good feedback. So we expect each of those target markets to continue to build over the course of this year.","In terms of those events, you know your numbers may make sense for a particular quarter, but as we said earlier, look it's still too early to call out a trend in terms of the annualized milieu we go through. And so while you do the math in a particular quarter, the reality is we need to wait at least through the second half of this year until we have enough data behind us to start the calling annualized trend that will be meaningful for your model. But this stage, it'll still be a little too volatile for it to be meaningful for use in your model. So I'd wait maybe a couple more quarters and we may be at a stage then where we can give you a number that's useful.","Operator","Thank you, the next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is open.","Amanda Murphy","I actually had just a follow-up to Doug's question in terms of HiSeq consumables. So you've mentioned instead of down 20 million sequentially, so obviously as to your point, you got you know -- customers have pipelines they're working through. So should we think about that as sort of a slow tick down over the course of the year? And then also just I think one of the questions to originally and it may still be too early. How our customers thinking about the NovaSeq in terms of conversions? In other words, did you have a 10 HiSeq exit where they buying, 5 NovaSeq just given the capacity differences in the platform?","Francis deSouza","Sure, you certainly think of the transition as something that's going to play out not, just at you over the course of this year, but as we said this is sort of a multiyear phenomenon, right. So you will see it play out this year, the next year, the year after. And so, it will be that, that transition over the course of those quarters. In any given quarter, there may be little bit more that happens than another quarter, and so it won't be the same in every quarter, but you can certainly view it as playing out over the next two to three years as we'd expected. The second, what was the second part of the question?","Amanda Murphy","Just around converts, so just given the capacity differences within NovaSeq, how are people thinking about buying the amount of Seq the same platform? So in other words, if you have a X 10, are they buying 4? Or I know it\u2019s early, but just can we think about how people think about capacity as at this point?","Francis deSouza","Yes, in terms of you know the number of NovaSeq they're buying, if you look at the number of customers that bought NovaSeq. A lot of the customers that have bought NovaSeq for existing HiSeq customers that may have had just one or two HiSeq for example, and so obviously from them, they're moving from a single HiSeq to a single NovaSeq. And as we talked about certainly in some of the quarters last year, a lot of our pipelines for NovaSeq were onesie-twosie customers.","It\u2019s still early for us to talk about how customers are thinking about an entire fleet replatforming. Those fleet replatforming are still in front of us. So customers are still buying their initial NovaSeqs and running them, and I think over the coming quarters we\u2019ll start to see full on conversion, and at that point it will be more meaning for us to talk to you about what ratio we\u2019re seeing, but that\u2019s still in front of us.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.","Puneet Souda","I had a question on -- you talked about population studies and whole genome sequencing, and I just wanted to understand, and there\u2019s a significant drop here in the sequencing cost from -- off an exome, on NovaSeq compared to 4,250, so that was run, but -- and that has accelerated significant volume demand. But I am just trying to understand, for our whole genome, it was already sitting at parity in terms of sequencing cost in the genome centers with HiSeq X. You talked about a couple of projects, but I am just trying to understand. Are you happy with the progress on the whole genome demand that\u2019s you\u2019re seeing in the market? Or is there a room for acceleration there with maybe improved pricing to drive that population genetics and larger studies here for whole genomes and for genome centers?","Francis deSouza","Sure, NovaSeq was a big step forward in terms of democratizing access to high super genomics and more specifically to democratizing access to the price points for whole genome sequencing, that previously were only available to customers who could spend the 6 million or the 10 million to buy an X. And so, NovaSeq was actually a move towards driving the market or enabling the market to do more full genome sequencing, and we certainly started to see that play out in a number of areas.","We\u2019ve seen customers that are now doing bigger cohorts because of NovaSeq. We\u2019ve now seen customers that are doing deeper sequencing and doing more studies of those hard to find applications, like liquid biopsies for example, or a deeper tumor sequencing because of NovaSeq and we think that must do broader sequencing, so we have seen customers that were looking at small panels to enlarged panels or to exomes and from there to genomes, and we\u2019ve certainly had examples of all of those happen since we launched NovaSeq.","And so we are very pleased with how that thesis is playing out. We continue to believe in the long-term elasticity of this market though. And we continue to believe that whole genome sequencing is an important driver not just in volume, but will have benefits -- the lower prices sequencing will have benefits in a whole bunch of other applications too. So, single cells, whole exomes, more panels will all be enabled by these better price points. We\u2019ve talked about the fact that we continue to believe looking into the future that there is elasticity in this market.","And one of the reasons we put out there that there is going to be continued reductions in price in the coming years enabled by this NovaSeq architecture is one of the have market start thinking about what they could do, as price of sequencing goes down. And we\u2019ve started those dialogues already. So, we believe that the price points we\u2019ve enabled right now are expanding the market, and we believe there is continued elasticity in this market in the years to come.","Operator","The next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.","Ross Muken","So, on the clinical side, there\u2019s just been a huge [indiscernible] of news updates, both on the policy side as you noted in the call and then you had some pretty interesting relationships you called out one of them, but on the tumor mutation side seems like a lot happened. Help us understand how some of these recent developments help to frame the next I don't know, 18 to 36 months in that market? And how some of the incremental clarity is allowing for maybe pharma and others to sort of dive in and also push on the liquid biopsy side as well?","Francis deSouza","You bring up a really good point, Russ. We're definitely seeing a much more favorable market starting to emerge both on the regulatory and reimbursement side on a number of fronts. And maybe I'll just touch on a few of them. And I also say that some of this is actually the result of work that we have been doing at Illumina together with our customers and partners to create the necessary studies to build the bodies of evidence to engage in dialogue with regulatory bodies around the world.","And so, the work we've been doing over the last 2 to 3 years feels like it's contributed to an acceleration and the momentum we're seeing both from a regulatory perspective and a reimbursement perspective, I mean as you think about some of the things that have happened recently, the FDA approval of the foundation one companion diagnostic will definitely encourage the development of further breakthrough NGS steps, now that there is a clear pathway to approval.","The CMS determination of oncology and NGS reimbursement open the door for reimbursement of other companion diagnostics of 501K and LGTs in oncology. And in the last month, the FDA issued final guidance on NGS testing development and validation helps because it provides the framework for companies who are developing these NGS base test to use for development and validation themselves. And it takes a little bit of mystery around what the FDA is looking for.","We're also sitting at a good place given what's happened over the last few months in markets like rugged. We now have whole exome sequencing testing covered for 124 million lives here in the U.S. for rugged conditions. And so, there is a lot happening in terms of regulatory approvals, we saw that with the approval that the FDA gave 23andMe for example for the BRCA testing, the mutations that C mutations that they report on in the BRCA1 and 2 genes.","So, a lot of the momentum is starting to build. A lot of it has yet to show up though in terms of our revenue. So, I feel like we're laying the groundwork for the continued building of the oncology market, the productive health market, the consumer genomics markets, and those will pay dividends into the future.","Operator","Next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Lots of talk on sequencing and consumables and actually the microarray business was a big source of upside variance versus our model. So I'm wondering, Francis, if you could elaborate on the trends in microarray? And whether or not, I know there is a seasonal aspect there and you're probably planning for some of that strength, but whether or not any of the upside in the guidance for the balance of the year assumes a more bullish outlook on the microarray business?","Francis deSouza","Yes, you're right. I mean our microarray business has definitely been a very strong performer in the past. Overall as you said, we saw 48% growth in Q1. And that's driven by a number of factors, one big factor obviously that we talked about is the DTC market that direct-to-consumer market. The consumer genomics market has hit an inflection point we feel in 2017, but it's still in very very earliest stages of adoption, given how much innovation is happening in the space, given the penetration in the space, and given now a more favorable regulatory environment.","In 2017 as you know, we genotyped or sequenced on our platforms 7 million samples and that's more than we did in the previous 10 years combined. Genealogy is the first breakout application for consumer genomics, but the going rate of discovery enabled by our sequencing systems is broadening this market to include health, wellness, nutrition, fitness, and so we believe that that market has head room to continue to expand. And as that market expands, it's obviously driving the growth in our microarray business.","We're also seeing this phenomenon take hold outside the U.S. We are tracking and are now over a 100 companies around the world that are targeting the direct-to-consumer markets, and we're seeing pretty exciting emerging companies for example in China where the opportunity is clearly sizeable, right. So in April, WeGene which is a personal genomics company announced they're going to use our microarray platform to establish a lab in Asia and extend its consumer DNA testing offering.","It'll start by offering genealogy testing for over the 50 subgroups in China. So really this is starting to emerge as a global phenomenon, not just a U.S. phenomenon as well. So that's very exciting. And then on the question Dan around the full year and what we expect from microarrays compared to our previous estimates, obviously, the full year also includes some of the benefits that we saw in terms of the stronger-than-expected microarray performance in Q1. So it is higher than our prior expectation as we look towards full year '18.","Operator","Next question will come from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik de Bruin","So I'm going to sneak in two questions. One is on and sort of a follow-up to Dan's question, on the sequencing services business, you've had a couple of quarters of 20% growth. How should we think of sequencing services going forward? And could you do a little bit of a breakdown on what's consumer have milestones where oncology and competing diagnostics programs? And then just what sort of regular sequencing services in terms of instrument upkeep? And then the other question I'm going to ask is, you know you said NextSeq placements grew Mini and MiSeq placements grew Nova was in the range. I'm just wondering, was there something in the Nova ASP in terms of people doing trade-ins or product communion was the -- what is the ASP to Nova because I think that could be one of the reasons why maybe our models are off on the instrument numbers for the quarter?","Francis deSouza","Okay, so let's start with the sequencing services and the strength in sequencing services. So, I got that, I got the question around the oncology program and the question around NovaSeq ASP, so it's a three for Derik, well done. Okay, on the sequencing services, the strength there was driven by things like the work we're doing for gel, and so we talked about the fact that the gel projects have been over 50,000 of its 100,000 genomes and is actually on a pretty robust space in terms of working through the samples that they're getting. So the pipelines are flowing and they expect -- we expect I guess sequencing to complete that project over the course of this year.","And so that accelerated pace has been translating into some of the strength we're seeing in sequencing services for example. The oncology program, so you saw over the last few weeks we announced partnerships with Loxo Oncology obviously and BMS around creating companion diagnostics for their therapeutic Opdivo and Yervoy, and then larotrectinib and and LOXO-292. Those are multiyear collaborations. We\u2019re kicking them off now. They certainly have milestones that happened over the course of the next couple of years and that the way we\u2019ve restructured, there\u2019s some revenue upfront and some tied to the achievement of the milestones. And that\u2019s about as much as sort of where we\u2019re talking about the specifics of those agreements.","We\u2019re obviously hugely excited about it. You should also expect that we are going to continue to do more partnerships like those maybe strategic around those collaborations. Those partnerships did not have any revenue impact in Q1, and so the revenue associated with those partnerships is obviously still in front of us, and you should look to see us do more in the coming quarters.","In terms of the NovaSeq ASP, it was roughly within range as we\u2019ve been seeing over the last few quarters, it was slightly down because a multiunit deal shipped over the course of the quarter and that is the biggest driver of the variation in ASPs quarter-to-quarter. And so in a quarter where you\u2019re seeing mostly the onsie-twosie, you\u2019ll see a slightly higher ASP in a quarter where customers are taking multiunit orders, you\u2019ll see the average ASP in the quarter be slightly lower.","Sam Samad","Yes, maybe just to add a couple of comments to Francis\u2019 comments really along the same lines. First of all on the sequencing services, the maintenance contract piece, the other piece is beyond the gel piece that Francis talked about, which was favorable for Q1. Those are really essentially I would say growing and performing on track in terms of expectations. So nothing unusual there, you will see some movements between quarters, but really there's nothing unusual to point out, material to point out. Gel was definitely one of the key aspects in terms of the performance of that business in the quarter at least the category of sequencing, services.","The other piece with regards to the oncology collaborations, as Francis said, we haven\u2019t recognized any milestones or contributions from them. We will going forward as these start to take off. The other thing to keep in mind is down the road we would expect to see after these take effect after these collaborations. And we\u2019re talking here over the long-term. We\u2019ll start to see also additional consumables and instruments sales as a result of these collaborations as well, mostly in the form of NextSeq Dx and the related consumables. So, you will see that but that's not for now, that\u2019s not for \u201918, that\u2019s down the road.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Arias with Citi. Your line is open.","Dan Arias","Francis, wondering if you could just help us with how much of the S4 volume is going to non-genome centers? And for the labs that are taking S4, are you seeing them move pretty wholesale to that configuration just in terms of what are they are running? Or is it a mix, so their different experiences there but maybe just an overall view?","Francis deSouza","Yes, sure. We don\u2019t provide that specific breakdown but from just a color perspective, we\u2019re seeing a broader adoption from -- for S4, not just to genome centers. And in the cells that happen to genome centers, the way the NovaSeq adoption is going, and frankly the way we expect it to go and expected it to go is, we\u2019re seeing customers buy one or two NovaSeqs first. And then overtime phase in additional NovaSeqs, a lot of customers are continuing initially to run their excess or their HiSeq side by side with the NovaSeqs and moving workloads onto the NovaSeqs rather than just shutting down what's happening -- completely shutting down the excess of the NovaSeqs. And so, that\u2019s how we expect the rollout to go. The replatforming and it's going to be sort of a big cut off that happened, but a phasing in and a gradual phasing out of the other high throughput platforms.","Operator","The next question in the queue comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","First question is on the recent CMS decision. It looks like smaller private players maybe following CMS lead in terms of extending reimbursement coverage for next generation sequencing assays for oncology. Testing so I guess would be curious about kind of what your thoughts are there Francis about that becoming maybe a little bit bigger phenomenon in the Wix, CMS? And then secondly, just maybe to talk to us timing around the Harvard Pilgrim, NIPT study when you might expect to start to see this influenced either guidelines or private payer recommendations?","Francis deSouza","They're both different. I think the CMS decision has been so good on a number of fronts. Obviously, it's great in terms of directly providing reimbursement in that for oncology tests. And frankly, the final coverage determination was even better than the draft that was submitted a few months ago because it took away restrictions around things like number of tests for example or the fact that it can only be done on IVDs. And so, now we are really happy with what the [NCD] means for oncology NGS testing market.","It really makes that those steps available to millions, 10s of millions of customers that franky wouldn't have had access to that test before. But the knock-on effect is also there as you pointed out, and you have seen as you've noted some private payers follow in that such steps. And so that's been really encouraging to see. Obviously, CMS is an influential player in the market. So that's been positive.","In terms of the Harvard Pilgrim, that's also something I'm personally very excited about because it's sort of an innovative partnership that we're doing with Harvard Pilgrim. And the intent here is to work with them to do a real world study and get the results back associated with expanding coverage for NIPT. And the intent here is to get the data, the test runs about 18 months when we should think about as getting to completion and get that data. And in that time, we're entering sort of -- again it's a partnership with them. So in return for helping them we are getting access to the data to put the study together. So, really it's the back half of next year. We should start to see the data come back from that study.","Operator","And the next question is from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Maybe just one on NextSeq, that's been particularly strong for the last few quarters with the pull-through coming in even at the high end or above your previously guided range. So, have you gotten new point where you need to reset expectations around that system? And then also, is there any particular application or two you'd call out NextSeq kind a gaining outsized momentum?","Francis deSouza","Yes, NextSeq has definitely emerged as our sort of mid throughput work course instrument. It's definitely a work course instrument in the clinical market. And as you pointed out, we've had a few quarters now whereas the pull-through of NextSeq above our guided range. This quarter was within the guided range, but we certainly had a number of quarters before that where it was above that. We're at the stage where we're ready to change the range. So, we'll just -- we'll point out where it falls within or outside the range, but it's definitely a work course platform for us.","The applications that are running on it, there are number of applications that are driving the demand for NextSeq, the NextSeq consumables. It seems oncology testing. It's the core and service labs that are doing the oncology testing as well as medical research labs. We are seeing NextSeq to be used a lot for NIPT. It's another sort of big clinical application that's driving the demand for NextSeq. And so I said those are some of the big applications and then we've obviously announced a number of partnerships that are on the NextSeq globally, and so those will also drive the demand of NextSeq.","Sam Samad","One small additional thing I'd add is, we're also seeing some examples of customers moving MiSeq work over to NextSeq as well given the larger sample sizes and the improved economics that come with NextSeq.","Operator","The next question in the queue comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Sam, I don't want you to think we've forgotten about you. I just wanted to ask a few quick more clarification questions, not a complicated three-parter, it's a simple three-parter. One is, can you give us any sense of how substantial the contribution is from the pharma collaborations that you can announce this year on the top line? Second, currency, how much do we think currency does for us on the top line this year? And then last one is just on OpEx, you called out a few timing items there, can you give us any sense of magnitude of the timing items on OpEx that you called out there?","Sam Samad","Yes so, let me start with the pharma collaborations. As we indicated, they're definitely part of our revised guidance range and part of the reason why we also upgraded guidance to the 15% to 16% for the year. We're not going to size them at this point. Steve, it's still very early in the process of working through some of the collaborations, and we will be giving color as we go in terms of the progress of these partnerships. But at this point, we're not providing a specific sizing as to what that revenue impact is, but they are included in the 15 to 16% revised guidance.","With regard to currency on the top line for Q1, as we mentioned in our prepared comments, it was three percentage point improvement in terms of growth or benefit tailwinds in terms of growth that helped us. And for the year really I would say more or less in line with our prior expectations in terms of currency benefit which was included in the guidance. So really not much of change for the full year, but potentially we could still see some tailwind there from appreciation in the euro which we seen benefit from in Q1. But I'd say in terms of the full year, not much has changed from our previously announced guidance.","And then the last question was around OpEx, I believe. With regard to OpEx, as we mentioned there was -- we were definitely below expectations in Q1 slightly higher than Q4 sequentially, but below expectation in Q1 driven by OpEx spend some I would say projects that have shifted into Q2 and the second half of the year. I would say largely in terms of OpEx. We are flat as a percentage of sales. We're still flat to slightly increasing compared to 2017. So I think the best way to look at it is, we are slightly increasing versus what we mentioned earlier.","When I say earlier in terms of our previous guidance and the reason for that as we said in the prepared comments is we believe that we have some potentially very accretive investments that we can use to drive and continue some of the momentum in the business that we've seen. And so that's why if anything I would encapsulate it as, slightly higher OpEx as a percentage of sales compared to what we had announced versus \u201917.","Operator","The next question in the queue comes from Catherine Schulte with Baird. Your line is open.","Catherine Schulte","I was just wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on the Chief Medical Officer hired last month. Any additional commentary you can give on where Phil's focus will be? And any specific projects he'll be initially working on?","Francis deSouza","Yes, I am very excited to have Phil Febbo join the leadership team here at Illumina. He has a deep background as Chief Medical Officer of Genomic Health before this but also, both in a commercial environment as well as in academic environment in the places like UCFF. He is going to have a very important role here on the leadership team in terms of guiding our overall medical strategy, that includes working with the thought leaders in the different domains that we\u2019re working, so reproductive health, in oncology, making sure that we deeply understand where they are trying to go as well as they understand what\u2019s coming, and so what they should be thinking about from us.","He also has a very key role to play in our conversations with the payer community in terms of making sure that we\u2019ve a deep partnership with them to develop the studies that will generate the evidence of clinical utility as well as the economics analysis associated with getting our tests broadly adopted. Phil will also have a role in terms of working with the regulatory bodies around the world making sure that we are communicating the responsible use of our technologies in the different countries around the world. So lots of work there, he\u2019ll also be responsible in terms of engaging with the physician community to share our vision of how genomics and NGS testing can help drive forward a number of domains. So, he has lots of work to do.","Operator","And Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","I wanted to get your perspective on guidance. You highlighted a number of positive dynamics at play, the first quarter be it clinical opportunities, be outlook for sequencing consumables, the NovaSeq placement outlook. Was there any thought around taking up guidance more meaningfully at this point? And are there any concerns that you have in the market right now?","Francis deSouza","I would say first of all we have got some tremendous momentum in the business, so we\u2019re very excited about the momentum. We\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019ve seen in Q1 in terms of the fantastic results that we are seeing across sequencing consumables and definitely the much better expected performance across microarrays that we saw in Q1. Having said this, it\u2019s still only Q1, and so we have upgraded guidance for the year, from 13% to 14% to now, 15% to 16%. But obviously it has only been three months, since we\u2019ve announced guidance, original guidance.","So, I would say at this stage nothing in the market that really concerns or alarms us I would say in terms of NovaSeq performance, going exactly as expected and we\u2019ve seen the upgrade cycle as we\u2019ve talked about we expected to be a multiyear upgrade cycle and that\u2019s just playing out in the market. We\u2019ve seen tremendous performance across consumables, nothing really that I would say is concerning and momentum across the clinical business as well. But having said this is only Q1. And that's why we\u2019ve kept to the 15% to 16% at this stage.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve one more time for one last question. The last question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.","Mark Massaro","Francis, I'm curious if you could comment whether or not you think the 23andMe approval of the BRCA variance might be opening up a flood gate for other variance to come? And then as we think about the consumer genomics inflection here, where do you expect whether it's from ancestry, fitness or nutrition? Where do you think the biggest initial uptick will be from partners like Helix?","Francis deSouza","Yes. I think we have seen even over the last year, sort of really good progress in terms of the regulatory approval for direct-to-consumer testing. So if you remember a year ago, the FDA approved the first 10 what they called GHR, genetic health risk, reports to be published to direct-to-consumer without physician intervention. And at the time, they didn't allow cancer predisposition testing. This was a year ago, but they allow things like early onset Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.","And a set of conditions that they felt could be responsibly reported back to the consumer. And even though at the time they specifically said, they weren't going to allow cancer predisposition testing. They continued obviously to engage with companies like 23andMe. And what they were looking for was the studies that would show that consumers could understand what was and what wasn't in the report they were getting. And we are thrilled to see the work that 23andMe has done with the FDA to get those reports cleared.","Given now what we saw last year and now with the new approvals, I have no doubt that you will continue to see more play out in the future. It's certainly the stated vision of Ann at 23andMe, to continue to put genomic information in the hands of consumers in a responsible way. And so, that's their mission, they're continuing to engage to make sure that happens. At the same time, you're seeing other companies like Helix certainly and Ancestry, also look to move more into the health reporting stage.","I know Ancestry moving from being primarily focused on genealogy. They're adding more health reports to their offering. And frankly, Helix has always been targeted at that market even at founding. So if you look at some of the partners that Helix signed up and some of the partners they've announced recently. For example, the new Helix partnership with PerkinElmer really allows them to report on the ACMG's list of 59 genes that are known to cause severe disease. So that's the report that they're specifically targeting through their partnership with PerkinElmer.","So I think you can continue to see more of that happen. And I think as we expand the health part of the consumer genomics market that expands the whole market obviously.","Operator","Thank you.

Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to report that Q2 was another strong quarter for the company. Order receipts exceeded our expectations resulting in a record exiting backlog.","Revenue increased 21% year-over-year to $539 million, slightly above the guidance provided on last quarter's earnings call. The leverage we delivered this quarter was also remarkable as non-GAAP earnings per share grew 40% compared to the second quarter of 2014. These robust results were due to strength in sequencing revenue and solid operational execution.","Second quarter total sequencing revenues grew 28% year-over-year driven by record consumables and strength in services. Shipments to clinical and translational customers grew 45% year-over-year to approximately 40% of total shipments further demonstrating the expanding utility of Genomics.","Oncology was a significant driver of this mix as use of NGS expanded in hospital laboratories and commercial molecular diagnostic settings. Shipments to all segments of oncology grew approximately 35% year-over-year.","Over the past several quarters, we've shared some of our strategies to penetrate this market which include our onco panel and liquid biopsy programs. We're on track to deliver \u2013 release one of the onco panel as an RUO product by the end of the third quarter.","This initial release includes 15 genes critical in oncology and sets the groundwork for our onco panel products that will be CE-IVD marked and FDA approved.","We're committed to delivering the enhanced 170-gene version of the onco panel to address the needs of the research market early next year. We will also be providing this product for use by our pharma partners in their clinical trial.","Our liquid biopsy program continued to make progress during the second quarter. As part of this effort, a study was recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association which showed specific examples where discordant NIPT results were detecting maternal cancer. Our development teams are optimizing assays and exploring their clinical power for use in this exciting frontier of genomics.","Our market development strategies in reproductive health also contributed to the higher mix of clinical and translational customers in the second quarter. Sales to IVF reference laboratories increased 25% in Q2 with approximately 20% of sales now coming from VeriSeq PGS. As a reminder, VeriSeq PGS is our sequencing-based pre-implantation genetic screening solution used as laboratories transition from the older generation arrays.","Total NIPT revenue including products, services and test fees grew more than 50% versus the second quarter of last year. This result was due in part to a doubling of test send-out samples, as well as an increase in product sales to NIPT providers globally.","Our partnership with Berry Genomics, the second largest NIPT company in China, is progressing well after the recent Chinese FDA approval of Berry's assay and the NextSeq CN500. This has resulted in an increase of shipments for resale to Chinese hospitals that are bringing NIPT in-house.","During the quarter, we signed a similar deal with Annoroad, the number three NIPT player in the region, and will jointly bring together Illumina sequencers with Annoroad's assay development capability.","We believe the sustainability of NIPT revenue growth will come in part with the availability of our next-generation solution VeriSeq NIPT. We're in the final stages of the European regulatory process for the software and hope to have CE-marked shortly. We will follow with the CE mark on the VeriSeq NIPT product for distribution as an IVD solution.","During the second quarter, we signed five new partnerships outside the U.S. and now have a total of 19 VeriSeq NIPT customers working on installing the protocol in their respective laboratories.","Moving now to arrays, we continue to witness growth in sample volumes, but at lower prices. In the second quarter, Infinium volumes increased 29% yet total microarray revenue declined 11% year-over-year. Despite this result we have positive trends in the array market to share.","First, total genotyping orders were up 16% versus Q2 2014 driven in part by strength in agriculture due to the continued adoption of genomic selection in livestock for which our Bovine arrays are well suited.","For the year, we're projecting arrays to decline in the mid to high single-digits compared to the prior year. We expect the second half to be positively impacted by new custom products that will launch as a result of our increased R&D investment in arrays. This expanded product line includes an updated Immunoarray with an additional 140,000 markers of new content as well as a drug dev array which combines available genomic data with advanced computational tools that enable researchers to test targets earlier in the therapeutic development process.","Last thing I want to highlight are sample to answer solutions for forensic and HLA markets which continue to gain traction. The number of customers evaluating our TruSight HLA solution has close to doubled since Q1. We continue to build broad awareness for our MiSeq FGx solution and recently held a webinar for more than 400 target customers to further educate them on the importance of NGS in the forensics setting. Encouragingly we now have at least one major law enforcement customer in every region of the world, an important first step to broader market adoption.","Overall Q2 was another solid quarter for the company. Our momentum continues driving demand across our diverse customer base. As we move into the second half of 2015 and beyond, our relentless focus on market development and innovation in our sequencing portfolio will be critical factors in our ability to penetrate the large and untapped opportunities ahead of us.","I'll now turn the call over to Francis who will provide a detailed overview of our product results.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Thanks, Jay and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to provide an update on the performance of each of our product families in the second quarter. As Jay mentioned, total sequencing revenue grew 28% over the second quarter of 2014. This included sequencing instrument growth of 13% year-over-year due to demand for HiSeq and NextSeq, offset in part by lower HiSeq X shipments.","Again this quarter, we saw strong interest from new to Illumina, next gen sequencing customers who accounted for more than 45% of instruments ordered. This class of users is primarily interested in gaining exposure to sequencing through the MiSeq and NextSeq benchtop platforms. With this in mind, we have introduced a MiSeq promotion called New to NGS. This starter bundle includes training, sample prep and core consumables as well as the instrument and service plan needed to get a new sequencing lab up and running. We expect this to not only build the funnel of new customers, but also promote our entire sample-to-answer MiSeq solution in a cost effective manner.","Order dynamics for our benchtop instruments are largely unchanged from the trends seen in prior quarters. Across this portion of our portfolio, more than 45% of instruments ordered came from clinical and translational centers. As a result of these factors, MiSeq and MiSeqDx sales in the quarter continued to be strong. Rounding out our benchtop franchise is NextSeq, which saw a 16% sequential increase in shipments.","Development activities in reproductive health and oncology markets drove demand, which together accounted for close to 40% of quarterly NextSeq orders. Oncology customers grew close to 50% compared to the prior year as we saw a large, multi-unit order from a liquid biopsy company, as well as orders from customers focused in gene panels. Reproductive health customers also bolstered demand with the June availability of NextSeq 550, which enables both sequencing applications and microarray scanning for cytogenetic testing on a single platform. These data points are a strong indicator of broader adoption across a diverse set of customers.","We have made great progress improving the success rates on NeoPrep, and as a result the product is now in full commercial shipment with the TruSeq Nano prep kit. NeoPrep is very well matched to the benchtop sequencer market and we're pleased with the feedback received from early access sites on the instrument's performance and reliability. We plan to release the TruSeq mRNA kit shortly, and are actively working on building out the application menu for the system to further drive interest in this platform.","Moving now to our high-throughput sequencing instruments, in the second quarter, demand for the HiSeq family of products profited from the impact of HiSeq 4000 and the HiSeq X Five. As expected, shipments of HiSeq instruments will lower sequentially and year-over-year. We continue to expect HiSeq X orders and shipments to remain lumpy quarter-to-quarter and dependent on the timing of funding and customer readiness. Interest in the X platform remains high as we continue to add new customers in Q2, raising the total to 22. As well as ship systems to existing customers to increase their capacity","Exiting the quarter, our HiSeq X order funnel remains healthy resulting in an expected quarterly order rate of 20 to 30 HiSeq X units.","We have recently introduced new products and services to further improve the performance of HiSeq X. This includes the launch of an improved v2.5 flow cell, which has been made broadly available to our install base, as well as the associated software and firmware updates.","We also launched Illumina SeqLab, an integrated solution to help our customers maximize quality and throughput of their sequencing facilities. Through a partnership with GenoLogics and Hamilton Robotics, the Illumina SeqLab is designed to standardize and optimize the whole human genome sequencing workflow, reducing the time lab personnel need to spend operating the instrument and ensuring quality results. This solution includes the limb system, liquid handling robotics, data analysis and the consulting services a lab would require to get up and running as a next customer. We believe the addition of these offerings will increase the consumable utilization of our customers by moving them more quickly up the adoption curve.","Momentum grew through the first half for the expanded HiSeq family of instruments, including the HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq 4000. As expected, we saw an increasing fraction of orders migrate from the HiSeq 2500 to the HiSeq 4000, which just one quarter after launch became clearly the leading HiSeq platform sold. Interest in this instrument fueled higher shipments, both sequentially and year-over-year. Demand was driven in part by multi-unit orders from genome centers and commercial customers standardizing on the platform. We remain excited about this expanded portfolio given it offers tremendous flexibility to address various budgets and scientific priorities.","Moving now to an update on informatics, I am pleased to share that we recently hired a new general manager of our Enterprise Informatics business unit, Sanjay Chikarmane. Sanjay joins us from SAP and brings with him over 20 years of experience in enterprise software. I want to thank Nick Naclerio for the terrific work he did as the GM of this group and we look forward to him being able to focus full time on our opportunities in corporate and venture development.","We saw meaningful progress in the adoption of BaseSpace during the second quarter. We now have 65 applications available and app launches increased 45% compared to the first quarter. We saw 17% increase in runs uploaded sequentially and close to 50% of our accounts are current users of BaseSpace. We continue to focus on more fully integrating our data solutions to further build the informatics ecosystem surrounding the Illumina portfolio of sequencers.","I will now turn the call over to Marc who will provide a detailed overview of our second quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Francis. As Jay mentioned, total revenue grew 21% year-over-year, slightly exceeding our guidance. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 25%, bolstered by incoming orders that exceeded our projections, resulting in an impressive book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. This strong order trend will benefit shipments over the coming periods as the vast majority of the backlog is shippable within the next four quarters. Shipments in the Americas grew 32% year-over-year due to strength in HiSeq instruments and HiSeq X consumables. European and APAC shipments increased 16% and 2% respectively over the same period as growth in these two regions was muted due to the impact of currency.","APAC shipments declined $20 million sequentially as expected, due primarily to continued weakness in Japan as funding remained constrained. We expect a very slight improvement in the Japanese funding environment in the second half of this year, returning to normalized levels in 2016. Instrument revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $155 million in the second quarter, particularly encouraging given the strong Q2 2014 comparison. This increase was primarily driven by demand for NextSeq and HiSeq. Overall, we're very pleased with the HiSeq family of products as the lower sequential HiSeq X shipments were more than offset by the increased interest in the HiSeq 4000.","Overall consumable revenue in the quarter was $303 million, an increase of 23% compared to the second quarter of 2014 as higher demand for sequencing consumables and library prep was partially offset by a decline in arrays. Consumable revenue represented 56% of total revenue, up slightly from 55% in the prior year period, and lower than the 57% we saw in Q1.","Sequencing consumable revenue was very strong, growing 36% over Q2 of last year. HiSeq X and NextSeq utilization exceeded the respective guidance ranges we have provided. Quarterly shipments of NextSeq consumables were strengthened in part by increased adoption of the enhanced v2 reagents which became available late in the first quarter.","During the quarter, 5 of the 22 HiSeq X customers accounted for approximately 70% of X consumable shipments. And as a result we continue to see meaningful opportunity to raise pull-through of our lower utilization customers. With the recent introduction of the Illumina SeqLab, we should be able to accelerate new customers' ability to implement large-scale sequencing workflows and increase pull-through as a result.","MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of 40k to 40k, and HiSeq pull-through for instruments, including HiSeq X, was in our projected range of 300k to 350k.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts grew 35% versus Q2 2014 to $77 million. This improvement was driven by growth in NIPT services which benefited from increased test send out revenue, genotyping services and extended maintenance contracts associated with the largest sequencing installed base.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 72.4%, an increase compared to 72.2% in the first quarter. Year-over-year adjusted gross margins expanded 150 basis points due to efficiencies in leveraging manufacturing operations which were offset in part by currency headwinds.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $85 million or 15.8% of revenue, higher compared to $80 million or 14.9% of revenue in the first quarter due to the impact of additional head count and outside services expense.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $103 million or 19.2% of revenue, an increase compared to $97 million or 18% of revenue in the previous quarter due to higher headcounts and outside services associated with our ERP program.","As we have shared previously, as an organization, we've spent a tremendous amount of time and effort preparing to implement a new ERP solution, SAP, which we expect to go live next week. To-date this project has spent three years and will, we believe, enable us to scale our operations more efficiently and effectively to support long-term growth.","While this launch represents our single largest phase, we will continue to invest over the next few years in similar projects that enhance our ability to scale.","Returning to our results, adjusted operating margins were 37.4% compared to 39.3% in the first quarter, low sequentially as we added 315 net hires in Q2. Operating margin was higher compared to the 34.8% reported in the second quarter of last year due to the impact of improved gross margins and operating expense leverage.","In the second quarter, our stock-based compensation equaled $33 million, up slightly sequentially. For the remainder of 2015, we expect stock-based compensation expense to increase from the levels seen in the first half due primarily to the impact of our annual grants and growing employee base.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 28.9% compared to 29.8% in the second quarter of last year due primarily to the benefit of increased manufacturing in Singapore.","Non-GAAP net income was $120 million for Q2 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.80. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $85 million and $0.57 respectively in the second quarter of 2014. The impact of foreign exchange lowered Q2 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.06 relative to last year. We reported GAAP net income of $102 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to net income of $47 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the prior-year period.","Cash flow from operations equaled $171 million. DSO increased to 62 days compared to 59 days last quarter and inventory increased 9% in parts prepared for our systems transition. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $41 million due to spending associated with our ERP implementation as well as other ongoing investments focused on scaling the organization resulting in $130 million of free cash flow.","During the quarter our Board of Directions authorized a new 10b5-1 share repurchase program of $150 million which we will use to manage dilution from employee grants. In addition, we have $96 million remaining under our previously announced discretionary buyback program. We ended the quarter with $1.5 billion in cash and short term investments.","Turning now to our expectations for the remainder of 2015, we continue to project approximately 20% total company revenue growth and 23% growth on a constant currency basis based on current exchange rates. We've increased our 2015 non-GAAP EPS projection from $3.39 to $3.45, up from $3.36 to $3.42. Additionally, we continue to project the full-year pro forma tax rate of 27% which assumes 2015 federal R&D tax credit and other tax extenders of past prior to our fiscal year end.","For modeling purposes, we feel it is appropriate to assume a Q3 tax rate of 29% given the expectation that the R&D tax credit will be passed in Q4, and at that time, we will record the full-year impact.","In conclusion, I would like to punctuate a number of key fundamental performance indicators related to the second quarter results, firstly, robust instrument revenue growth driven by strong HiSeq and NextSeq shipment; secondly, sequencing consumables growth of 36% year-over-year, our eighth consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 30%; an order quarter which exceeded our expectations resulting in increased backlogs across each major line of business and our highest ever exiting backlog; and finally, significant performance in our Americas region, allowing us to manage through the impact of currency, as well as the weak funding environment in Japan.","We believe these fundamentals combined with our technology leadership, new product introductions and a focus on market expansion will enable us to continue to catalyze the broad adoption of genomics in 2015 and beyond.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question, and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we'll now open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Actually, Jay, I want to see if you can elaborate a little bit on your comments on the array market? I mean if we think about this, you've stepped up your R&D there, you've talked about bio bank contracts and you did do the Neogen agreement. So I'm just curious as to why you think that market is going to be down mid- to high-single digits?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I mean the comps are tough on the array market overall and a lot of it has to do with pricing, Tycho. Our unit volumes continue to increase in general in the array business, but pricing is becoming increasingly aggressive there. The bio banks to do the large-scale projects that they want to do are only enabled at pretty aggressive price points. So I think it's that combination that's causing us to predict the array business to be down overall. We had a good order quarter in arrays, but a lot of that is going to be in backlog and shipped out over the next two to four quarters.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then if we think about kind of swing factors for the back half of the year and things that could drive upside on the revenue line, you've got population sequencing, NIPT. One the HiSeq 3000\/HiSeq 4000 uptick, that's another thing that potentially could accelerate quite a bit. Maybe just talk a little bit about the dynamics of HiSeq 2500 customers because you have rapid run mode in the HiSeq 2500, but not the HiSeq 3000\/HiSeq 4000, so what percent of those customers do you think pulled out? And I guess what are you telling customers on HiSeq 2500 in terms of phasing it out overall? Are you maintaining any commitment to servicing it for the next year? Or what are those discussions like?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we have a long-term commitment to servicing any instrument that we put in the field and we typically will do that for five years to seven years after we stop shipping it. So even after we declare something no longer available for sale, we'll continue to support it for a long time, so there's no concern there. We did see, in the quarter, a great shift toward the HiSeq 4000, which is what we predicted would happen, the performance of that instrument, the price per base, the pattern, the flow cell roadmap are all important ingredients for people to move to the HiSeq 4000. You can almost think of it as a slightly de-rated X that's allowed to run all applications. So that was, we think, largely responsible for that shift. We do think over the next year to two that the people buying the HiSeq 2500s will gradually decrease and it'll, in some sense, obsolete itself. But the one feature that we have on the HiSeq 2500 that customers like a lot is that rapid run feature. So we're taking a look at whether, at some point in time we want to introduce that on the HiSeq 4000, but right now, we're not actively working on that feature.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll hop back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Co.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. So I think the first thing I want to do is just try to align order and placement commentary with the Q2 revenue model. Were there any timing dynamics that impacted the pacing of placements such as, but not limited to, funding? Really I guess what I'm getting at is were there some issues where customers wanted instruments but maybe weren't able to pay for them based on the timing of, say, when NIH funding becomes more available? And I guess related to that, the 20 to 30 instrument order rate guidance that you provided on a quarterly basis, I think that's new. You talked about shipment timing lumpiness. Would you be willing to say if you were in the 20 to 30 placement range this quarter?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'd say we were in that ballpark during the quarter, Doug. And we think that's going to be the rough range. Some quarters will be a bit higher, some might be a bit lower and that's why we've made the lumpy comment in the script. In terms of customer buying patterns, customers always want to buy more sequencers if they had infinite money and so it is the case that people who don't have money would want to get a sequencer earlier if they could. But that's not a unique thing to the second quarter.","I think what we saw in the second quarter was very strong orders but some labs are not ready to take delivery, and that was true in fact in some X's where we received orders for complete X systems, X Tens in fact, but the labs aren't ready to take those instruments, and so some of those shipments will be spread out over the next two to four quarters. That was true in the array business as well. We got some large array contracts that will ship over time, and I think that's why you see a pretty big gap between the order receipt rate and where the revenue wound up.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I guess the follow-up is really just sort of a simple guidance question. If you beat your internal expectations for Q2, if order backlog is now at a record level and if momentum built over the course of the quarter, I guess I'm just curious if you contemplated increasing full-year guidance, and if not, why? Thank you.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we always contemplate what we do with the guidance, keeping it the same, raising it or lowering it based on what our expectations are. We do have a rich backlog, as we cited in the script, but we don't know exactly when these labs are going to be ready to take delivery and customers move their delivery times in and out all the time, every quarter. So we do have a little bit of uncertainty in the exact timing of shipments of parts of the backlog. Having said that, we think the fundamentals of the business are strong with the new orders that we received, we are really, really pleased. And as I said in the script, we exceeded our order plan during the quarter, and we're really pleased with that outcome.","Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You there, Derik?","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good afternoon. Sorry about that. Hey, just a couple of quick ones. So can you give a specific backlog dollar number?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We didn't.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, you said 1.1 though? Is that what I heard?","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That was book-to-bill, book-to-bill.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, book-to-bill. Got you. Okay, book-to-bill. Got you. Right. So have you seen any issues in terms of any changes in the Chinese market, ordering and some of the economic stuff going on right now impact how you're sort of looking at that market, going forward? And then I have one quick call after that.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I don't think we've seen \u2013 we haven't seen any real changes in the Chinese market over the last couple of quarters. The research funding was better in the Chinese market maybe 18 months ago than it has been over the past year. That's been masked a bit in China, particularly in 2014 because we had such a large number of X placements that we didn't expect in China. So our performance is quite good in 2014 in China. This year it won't be quite that good because we'll have X shipments into China.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, that's helpful. And then just one quick one, on the JAMA paper that you just did on the aneuploidy detection in pregnant women and finding that, I guess besides looking at chromosome aneuploidy, what are you looking at in terms of either point mutations or small indels or something like that, I mean is your liquid biopsy technology capable of addressing those types of changes in assay nodes?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, sure. I mean the question on liquid biopsy is what is the right assay method or combination of assay methods that we know.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Correct, yeah.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Aneuploidy will pick up some types of cancers. Nobody quite knows yet the fundamentals of the biology, so we don't know exactly which ones would be picked up by that method versus permutations versus fusions versus methylation. So there's many things we're exploring there, and I think lots of companies are working on this to determine what the best methods might be. And I suspect the market is going to wind up as a whole host of different tests that will be complementary to each other.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a million. So Jay, if you or someone were just saying from the outside, their first kind of look at this might be revenue relative to at least Street expectations to kind of in, the gap there has been narrowing, you have tough comps in the second half, no real new instrument launched to speak of. Can you maybe just talk \u2013 I know you talked a lot about your order growth and how excited you were. But could you maybe I don't know, just talk about your comfort and the visibility that you have in the second half and that you have with the guidance that you've outlined for the rest of the year? And then as a follow-up to Mark, can you maybe explain a little bit \u2013 you mentioned inventory was up because of the ERP that was going to go live. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the receivables as well? Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Jon. I think our visibility is about as good as it has been historically. I won't think we have a lot more or a lot less than we've typically had. I think one key factor we're dealing with is the weakness in the Japanese market. So in Japan even though it was weak, Q1 was an okay Japan quarter and Q2 was always the worse Japan quarter, so certainly that was a factor in the revenue in Q2.","And we caught up on the backlog of HiSeq X shipments. So now we're really in very much a steady state in terms of where we are in terms of balance between orders and shipments and I think that steady state gives us pretty good confidence going into the back half of the year. The sales force is feeling really good about the overall momentum of the business and a lot of the new hires that we're bringing in are in the commercial part of the organization because we do feel very strongly that there's lots more business out there to be had and as we expand our commercial reach, that we'll be able to incrementally bring in more revenue with existing product lines. We are continuing to launch new products even though we haven't pre- announced any new systems. We have lots of products in the pipeline that will be announced virtually every quarter from here through next year.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And then Jon, on your question about inventory and receivables, you're correct, inventory, we talked about being up 9% and it was related to the ERP implementation and our building of safety stock to ensure a smooth transition there. On the receivables, the DSO was up slightly from 59 days to 62 days just purely based to the timing of shipments being more back end loaded. And I'd say the AR book is still very, obviously, high quality and that's the DSO we're very happy with.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. On the NextSeq system, Jay, I think back in, I believe, January you talked about the road show that you guys went on after that product was launched and I believe at the time you said you had generated something in the neighborhood of 2,500 or so leads. Any way you can talk to how much of that you've worked your way through or converted just in order to try and get an updated view of the placement funnel there?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I don't have that number at my fingertips in terms of the size of the pipeline now. We did that road show shortly after launch in the early part of 2014. And we've seen benefit of that because the NextSeqs are marching up every quarter. I think the v2 chemistry has helped a lot. So any customers who felt there was a slight difference in quality from NextSeq to HiSeq, that's now totally neutralized with the v2 kits on the NextSeq. So we're really bullish on NextSeq, I think particularly in the NIPT market as we launch the VeriSeq NIPT broadly as we penetrate China with that platform. As larger panels come into the market where you need more throughput to run the panels, I think NextSeq is going to be really, really important product for us.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up on the X systems, I'm sure it's a combination of both, but maybe in general I'm curious whether you're finding that with the discussions that you're having on buying an X Five versus an X Ten, is it more a function of capital and funding right now, or is it more based on throughput and capacity? Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say it's a combination. So the X Fives that we're selling are to customers who will likely become X Ten customers at some point in time, but they want to walk before they run, if you will, and they're willing to pay a little bit extra on the price per genome for a while until they really understand what their pipeline looks like. So it's a combination of overall capital cost and whether they think they're ever going to get to an X Ten or not. To be clear here, we're also seeing the HiSeq 4000 I think as a very important addition right along that spectrum, and so it's the case that some people who might have wanted to buy an X One or X Two had we offered that are now really happy with the HiSeq 4000 product line that allows them to run all the different applications that we have in the portfolio.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. So I just had a two-part question on the HiSeq. The first part is, I think pre-4000, pre the launch of the HiSeq 3000, HiSeq 4000 you were shipping roughly 70, 80 platforms a quarter. So I'm curious, is that still the case and is that what you expect going forward just given that potentially the HiSeq 2500 to HiSeq 4000 conversion may not be exactly one-to-one given the throughput differences? And then the second part is there was also a discussion originally around the 1000 or so platforms that couldn't access the v4 chemistry of the 2000s and 2500s, maybe upgrading to the HiSeq 3000 or HiSeq 4000. So I'm curious if you're seeing any evidence of that, either this quarter in shipments or in the backlog. Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'd say the number you cited for the total for all the HiSeqs, 2500s up through the 4000, is in the range and we're hoping the HiSeq 4000 gives us a lift there over the next few quarters. So we're doing really well in combination. The mix shifted very dramatically this quarter away from the HiSeq 2500 and toward the HiSeq 4000. In terms of people doing upgrades, we don't have a lot of great data on that yet. We're certainly seeing some HiSeq 2500 customers who buy HiSeq 4000s turning off their HiSeq 2500s. And so we'll be \u2013 the way we report our reagent pull-through takes into account a certain fraction of the HiSeq 2500s that get turned off in the field. And so that's how we do the accounting there and at some point, maybe we'll have to update the installed base of HiSeq 2500s for you. We're not prepared to do that today, but we'll probably do that at some point. Yes. So I guess that's all I had to say. Did I answer your question, Amanda?","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. I guess I was just trying to get at whether there was this kind of evidence of incremental demand? And I guess you've talked a bit qualitatively, but incremental demand as the HiSeq 3000 customers perhaps couldn't access to before and then maybe they went on and bought the HiSeq 4000 because of the cost per base advantages. Maybe they weren't planning on buying it, but the advantages on the cost perspective were so great they opted to do that?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. That we're definitely seeing. We had a couple genome centers that ordered multiple HiSeq 4000s and the reason they did is because they could add a couple HiSeq 4000s and turn off some of the older HiSeq 2500s that they might have in the fleet. And so we're definitely seeing that pattern happen in the field and I think we'll continue to see it.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. Jay, just hoping you could comment on maybe, broadly speaking, where you think we are in the adoption curve for X Ten? Just assume \u2013 and part of that question, I guess wondering if your guidance assumes that any new population sequencing studies get initiated in the second half of this year?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'd say we're in the stable part of the X Ten lifetime right now, so that's why we gave the, sort of the quarterly ranges we should expect for your modeling purposes. I do think any large-scale population sequencing projects could be incremental to those numbers, so throughout the rest of this year, we don't have built in any large purchases for singular population sequencing projects. And that's because it's hard to know when any of those will close and they tend to be relatively long-term sales cycles for us. So that would be upside if perhaps somebody bought 20 or 30 for doing a large-scale project.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sure. That makes sense. Thank you. And then just a follow-up, maybe a longer-term question on liquid biopsy, appreciate your comments on the maternal cancer study that was published. I'm just wondering, as you think about like the size of some of these markets and what it costs to develop an IVD that's got the sensitivity and specificity that you need to have, is maternal cancer the type of product that you think is worth going after? Or is it just really an example, kind of proof of concept, and maybe there are other markets where liquid biopsy would be more compelling to start?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think what we published really was just an example that was, I guess we call it, incidental. Right? So the test was not designed to detect maternal cancer. We got discordant results. And when we went back to investigate in connection with those women that were in the paper, those 10, we were able to show that in fact what we were detecting was in fact cancer. So that isn't really how you would design a test if your goal is to detect cancer. It would be a very different test. It would be deeper sequencing, it would probably include other kinds of markers and as I said earlier, we're investigating lots of different methods and trying to understand which cancers are best detected, with which assay methodology.","Ultimately, the goal here would be to create as general a panel as you can but likely this whole market will begin with more targeted panel types from us and from others that have specific knowledge of the variants that are known in particular cancer types. But you wouldn't use the existing NIPT test as sort of the default liquid biopsy.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. That makes sense. Appreciate the comments. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys. So I'm going to stick just on the topic of instrumentation or just sort of pushes and pulls. So we've sort of hovered around $150 million or so a quarter for, I don't know, four or five quarters now. You sort of intimated that X Five, X Ten will be in that sort of 20 to 30 placement units a quarter range. As we think about what's going to break us out of this band to resume obviously at a huge step up from sort of the $100 million or so, or $85 million to $100 million range you've been doing for some time. If we think about the next phase of the step up, is it really predicated on a new platform launch or is it, to your comments before, maybe something that develops in POP Sequencing that's sort of outside you're privy today to be able to model or is it come from one of the other smaller platforms? I'm just trying to get a sense for where you see the biggest ability to see that trajectory change.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ross, I think it's going to come from all the new application areas that we're working on in the market development. And POPSEQ is really only one of those. Average risk is another and the whole VeriSeq NIPT platform we think will enable that. And that's starting to penetrate the market in Europe. It will be a significant contributor in China here over the next year or two in terms of NextSeq placements. I think what's going on in the consumer market is we have some impact in sequencing. I think over time the whole consumer space will begin to migrate away from arrays and toward sequencing because of the additional power you get from knowing all the bases rather than just the targeted bases.","What we're doing in forensics and HLA, we're in the very early phases of adoption in those markets, and those markets are going to be reasonably widely distributed, meaning there's lots of places that will run those applications and therefore I think will support instrument placements as well. So if you look at the existing lineup of hardware, I think the upward momentum in instruments will be driven by market development across new applications.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe looking at operating leverage, so you've been growing, it's on my math, on an organic basis OpEx in the 20%s and 30%s, sorry, on SG&A. That started to slow and you've got some really good leverage in 4Q and 1Q, and it continued to slow this quarter. How should we think about that line because it looks like R&D has been more constant sort of 20%, how should we think about the investments you need in the commercial organization, and how much leverage you can show there, and how we should think about that relative to the top line momentum?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, on a non-GAAP basis, our R&D and SG&A went up as a percentage of revenue this quarter from last quarter, so we do have a lot of open reqs. We have a lot of important things to be working on and so we're going to continue to add head count in key areas in commercial and in the R&D and research groups. So we're not at the point right now where we're predicting additional expense leverage, and we think that's the right position for the company to take. Again, non-GAAP we're at the 37% plus operating margin and we're pretty pleased with that.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Thanks...","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Ross, we added \u2013 I mentioned in my remarks, we added 350 net heads to punctuate Jay's point a little bit. And you'll see a full quarter effect of those additions in Q3 plus the new additions, the open reqs that Jay mentioned starting to filter.","Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI","Perfect.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you. Can you comment on interest from new customers in the HiSeq 4000? I believe you gave commentary on the benchtop market, but I don't think there was commentary on the high-throughput market.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I mean, clearly we have new customers in the HiSeq part of the market as well, Dan, but it's much less as a percentage than we have on the desktop instrument version just because of the capital cost. And most of the people who have been in the Sequencing market already own some version of a HiSeq, so they wouldn't be a new customer to us.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And my follow-up, Jay, I'm trying to better understand the sequential decline in consumables revenue. I hear you that arrays were weak, but just given the relative proportion of arrays versus sequencing and all the commentary on sequencing, I would've thought sequencing consumables would have been enough to sequentially offset array weakness. Can you help me understand what I'm missing?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Dan, I can cover that. Obviously, Q1 was very strong sequencing consumable growth. Q2 continued to grow but it was obviously offset by the array business decline, which pulled the overall growth number down. But as I mentioned on the call, we've seen, boy, we've seen eight quarters now of sequencing growth, sequencing consumable growth in excess of 30%. So we're very pleased with the Q2 result. I mentioned that both HiSeq X and NextSeq were slightly above their ranges, and the other instrument were within their ranges. So we're very comfortable with that outcome.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Bill.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","I want to thank you for the comment around the clinical and the translational instrument trend. It looks like that ticked up here nicely in the quarter. Can you help us think about maybe the bigger picture here? And what I'm trying to balance is we had this very rapid adoption curve going on in the clinic, and frequently around oncology as well as some other applications. But at the same time it looks to us like there's a little bit of inconsistent reimbursement trends in the States. And so I'd kind of love to hear some longer term thoughts there. And then also we're seeing some really nice, encouraging interest over in Europe as well, and any color there would be great. Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Reimbursement is classically a challenge for customers in the lab business, but part of the work we're doing in the onco panels is to deal expressly with that problem, and why we're working so hard to get IVD products approved so that we can have standardization around the products which makes the reimbursement easier because you have the clinical evidence and you have an FDA approved product. So our whole focus is to push these products toward IVDs that we think we think will accelerate the overall reimbursement. With respect to Europe, I'd say we had a good quarter in Europe. It was not as good as the Americas, the Americas really, really had a great second quarter. So we're super strong in the Americas, good in EMEA and not good in APAC is the sort of overall profile of the geographies.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. And then just a quick one for Francis regarding the ERP system, you mentioned that you're going live here in about a week or so. Is there any \u2013 and I certainly recognize you've been hiring a lot of people so you have additional OpEx, but is there any potential decline or associated reduced spend associated with that now that you have it implemented or I should say will have it implemented next week?","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Sure. Actually, Marc is driving our ERP implementation. So maybe I'll turn it over to you, Marc.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Sure. I wouldn't expect any immediate reduction in spend other than what's in capital in general, because there's the project related expenses tend to hit there. We still need a significant team to continue to manage through the initial period which we call hypercare and then on an ongoing basis. And then thinking about longer-term, one of the reasons for doing these projects is it enables us to scale and grow at a rate that is lower than the revenue growth and give us some leverage. And we would expect to see some benefit from a system like this over time, over a longer period of time. But we're going to be in this mode of implementing follow-on phases of ERP for the foreseeable future.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll start on the X. I'll reiterate the thanks for the 20 to 30 guidance. That certainly gives us more clarity there. Just as a follow-up to Isaac's question, I wonder, given how specific HLI has been about their plans to ramp up capacity this year, have you incorporated any HLI capacity expansion into that 20 to 30?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we've incorporated an overall forecast that kind of averages our probabilities across all the customers we know of. If the kinds of comments that have come out of HLI actually come to fruition, that's going to be an upside to the number if that happens in 2015.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on NIPT, you made a comment here in the Q&A about thinking about moving to average risk. I think the last time you commented on that process you had a view that in the U.S. that move might be more likely for late 2016. Am I sensing that maybe you're a little bit more optimistic about the timing there given some perhaps more open-minded language from ACOG here recently?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I guess our view hasn't changed on when we think ACOG or the guidelines will change with respect to average risk. But we are seeing the test being increasingly used in average risk patients, largely on a self-pay basis. And I think in Europe that will happen, particularly with the launch of the VeriSeq NIPT, I think labs have a more efficient way to do NIPT testing which will make the self-pay market more assessable. And so I think you'll see the leakage rate into average risk increase.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","And specifically, we view the ACOG commentary as a positive step in that direction because they removed their recommendation that you don't use NIPT for average risk screening, and so we feel incrementally we're seeing steps towards that timeframe.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Very clear. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid from Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi there, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. How important or meaningful was Berry following the Chinese FDA approval in driving your NextSeq backlog and NextSeq sales in the quarter?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We did get some orders from Berry, it wasn't a gigantic single order placement, I think they'll be spread out over time. So we did get some units from them but nothing that in and of itself moved the needle in a big way.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sounds good, Jay. And then a follow-up on NeoPrep, how are things shaping up with the pipeline there? Any thoughts on attachment rates to HiSeq currently and as we think out into the future? Thanks, guys.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The incoming order rate is pretty good on NeoPrep. We're just \u2013 we've been anxiously awaiting the time when we felt we could fully ship this product and we're now there. As we mentioned in the script, we worked really hard on this and it's complex to get this product super robust because we do tens of thousands of operations in a single run. And if you look at the statistics on this, if any one of those operations fail, a sample doesn't work. And so it's required some really great engineering to get this to where we've gotten it now and we're feeling really comfortable about it with the first kit, we're close to releasing the second kit, and then we've got a line-up of kits behind that. So we've made really fundamental improvements to the technology and we understand it really, really well. So I think you're going to begin to see the shipment rate increase and the shipments in Q2 were really pretty insignificant because we were still dealing with a handful of test customers to make sure we got them very happy with the platform and the results, success rate results on the instrument.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Wonderful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with Baird.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, thanks for the question. First one from me, Jay, on SeqLab, do you have any color you could share on where that offering could bring customer utilization on the X Ten, really in light of your comment about the concentration of utilization amongst the handful of customers. And then as a follow-up, do you have any plans right now to expand the X Ten to other sample types or beyond whole genome sequencing?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll make a comment on that and maybe Francis can add some comments about the product itself. Our hope certainly is that having SeqLab in place allows us to accelerate pretty substantially the rate of customers coming up the curve on a HiSeq X Ten. As we've plotted the consumable rates, you heard us say in the script that it's very biased, the consumables are very biased toward a few customers at the high end. And then it's \u2013 we've used the word bimodal but really if you look at the plot it just trickles down in a relatively linear fashion to customers at the low end, particularly geographies who are not using it as much as they should.","And so our goal is to just move all those customers up and I think having a software architecture around the boxes that simplifies all the lab management challenges that customer have, is going to push that up. We're not ready to sort of quote a rate on how fast that will go or what it'll do, but given the fact that we're already running above our guidance in terms of consumables on the X, to the extent we can move that curve at all is going to be very, very helpful to us. Francis, any comments on the product itself?","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Yeah. Sure. So one thing we heard consistently from customers around the X is that they were viewing the IT and informatics challenges as daunting and as, frankly, taking them time to actually get the lab up and running. And so the idea with SeqLab is to provide them this integrated solution that'll help them in a number of ways. One, it'll speed up how quickly they get the lab up and running. And then two, it'll enable them to be higher velocity sequencing labs. We have data, for example, when we look at our BaseSpace users, the data we have suggests that \u2013 today about 50% of our customers are connected to BaseSpace. And the data shows that customers who are connected to BaseSpace, on average are higher velocity customers than other customers, and so we see that in higher pull through. And so the idea with SeqLab is to enable our high throughput customers to get that same benefit.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","There was a second part to your question I didn't get to. What \u2013 remind me what that was?","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Opening up the X Ten to other sample type? Their \u2013 yeah.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. Yeah. Well, we continue to evaluate that. We've, in our planning sessions debate every quarter what the future of the X will look like in terms of whether we stick with X Five, in terms of how the units are deployed and whether we open other applications or other organisms. We don't have any decisions we're ready to share today about that, but we continue to evaluate it. And if some point, it's likely we'll make some changes on the X platform, but nothing to report today.","Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with BTIG.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. So I just wanted to kind of revisit the consumable question, Q-on-Q because it seems to be a topic of concern. Could you maybe clarify some of the projects that you have going on with the HiSeq X customers to help them ramp up? And how you kind of see that playing out? We've spoken to people in industry and saying, yeah, getting samples can be difficult and it's going to take time. Just maybe any color there in terms of how you see that higher utilization, higher capacity genome center really ramping up over the next couple quarters?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well I'd say on the X Ten \u2013 X Fives and X Tens, the classical high throughput sequencing labs are the ones that are at the high end of the user group that we have today. So they already knew how to do sequencing. They had plenty of samples. Many of them had samples in the freezer that they just couldn't fully sequence before because of price points. So those customers tend to already be at the high end of our curve. The ones we're working on are the ones that don't have the limb systems in place, don't have the analytics in place to analyze the data, and so some of them will turn on their X system and all of a sudden they've got 5,000 genomes, but they don't know how to analyze the genomes, and so they slow down a little bit until they figure that out. So SeqLab helps that a lot.","In some places, we can help with samples; in some places, we can't. We just have to let them deal with their sample acquisition challenges. Some of that has to do sometimes with consent. Some of it has to do with whether they're trying to access clinical pipelines and regulatory issues around access to clinical pipelines and samples. But in some cases, we can help customers get access to projects if they're doing things more in the service business and we do do that pretty routinely. And then you have at the very low end of our utilization curve, those customers where the purchase is almost more of a vanity buy, and we try to not do many of those. In fact, we push back on quite a number of customers who've said, we want to be in this game and there was really no clear thing they were going to do with the X, and so we haven't sold to them. But there's still a few at the low end that are not utilizing the system as we expect they should.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you. It seems like there might be a little bit of a disconnect if we frame things in terms of your TAM which you've laid out. Arguably, the commentary around some of these markets has been that uptake has been maybe faster than we've expected, and yet your revenue growth for the year has been \u2013 your expectations haven't really gone up in tandem. Can you comment about whether you still feel comfortable around some of the key assumptions that went into building some of the bigger pieces of that TAM model?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think we feel quite comfortable with that, and in fact, there's things that have happened since we talked about the TAM that not only make us comfortable with the numbers we gave, but probably would cause us, if we were to revise them today, to do that in the upward direction. In our markets, in general, the way the markets develop is that you see a gradual adoption rate, which extends over some relative period of time, a year or a couple of years, depending upon the market segment, and then the market hits an inflection point, and that inflection point can be driven by factors such as reimbursement, by the publication of clinical studies.","In the case of NIPT, it became a marketplace that exploded because the clinical data came out and replaced an invasive test. And so in oncology, we're going to see that inflection point happen. Is it going to happen a year from now or two years from now, it's hard to predict. But there will be an inflection point in the oncology market where that market will explode. And that would be around perhaps the time when in-practice guidelines it becomes standard of care to sequence every tumor when it's biopsied, and that will cause the market to grow very, very quickly.","In the POPSEQ market you'll see that inflection point once you begin to see the existing POPSEQ projects begin to demonstrate the fact that sequencing whole human genomes actually has an impact on the quality of care and the economics of health care. And once you start seeing that, that market will explode as well in our view. In the consumer market I think there's factors around that as well that we could go into about what's going to kick the consumer market into high gear. But I think there's some potential things that might happen here over the next year or two that could do that as well.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Rebecca Chambers for closing remarks.","Rebecca Chambers - Senior Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, operator.

Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina had a great start to 2019, generating revenue of $846 million in the first quarter of 2019, up 8% from the same quarter a year ago, and our 10th consecutive quarter of consistent, strong execution. Additionally, this quarter represented the first time in Illumina\u2019s history that our order volume exceeded $1 billion.","We continue to see strong demand for sequencing consumables, with first quarter revenue of $481 million, up 14% from the same quarter a year ago. This performance was driven by growth in a broad range of applications across our sequencing system family.","Over the last year, we have been working to increase visibility into the application growth drivers of our business. As a result, we are now able to share the approximate size and growth of a number of categories within our sequencing consumable business. We plan to update this on an annual basis with the understanding that these data points are directional.","With the analysis complete, I'm pleased to share that about 40% of our sequencing consumable shipments in 2018 was associated with clinical applications. From largest to smallest, this includes testing for oncology, reproductive health, genetic disease, and other. This group includes IDD and LDC validation, in addition to clinical testing, and grew approximately 30% in 2018.","Within clinical, oncology testing applications represented a little under 20% of our sequencing consumable shipments in 2018. Positive developments in the regulatory and reimbursement landscape are improving patient access to genomic profiling. For example, FoundationOne CDx received FDA approval in November 2017 and a national coverage decision for CMS in March of last year. Guardant Health has reported growing adoption of Guardant 360 following a favorable local coverage determination for select non-small cell lung cancer patients in September of 2018.","This was the first finalized Medicare coverage policy for an NGS based liquid biopsy assay in oncology. Tempus has also seen growing demand for its oncology testing. Tempus combines Illumina sequencing with machine learning to provide physicians a comprehensive report that highlights key findings to support clinical decision making.","Finally, in China, our partners that are extending their reach beyond NIPT and developing clinical applications including oncology. For example, Berry Genomics now offers comprehensive tumor gene detection for non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer as well as TMP detection for many types of cancers.","Also, in the first quarter, our TruSight Oncology 500 or TSO500 began shipping as a research use only product. This comprehensive genomic profiling assay is intended to complement the lab services offered by our partners. In the future, with the availability of a globally distributable IVD kit, TSO500 will enable labs of all sizes to offer a world class panel to their oncology patients.","Reception has been strong and shipments exceeded our expectations in the first quarter. A number of partners in the US, China, and the UK have announced that they're offering the panel. We also saw strong NextSeq shipments linked to TSO500 in several geographies.","The next largest contributor within clinical is reproductive health. In total, this group represented just over 10% of sequencing consumable shipments in 2018. Reproductive health applications include NIPT, in addition to a modest contribution associated with carrier and IVF screening. NIPT revenue includes VeriSeq NIPT as well as consumables supporting partners who offer their own NIPT or lab services.","In the US, just over half of all pregnancies are now covered for NIPT, including 97% of high risk pregnancies and 47% of average risk. Despite this covered population of about 2.2 million pregnancies, only 1.2 million NIPT tests were performed in 2018.","This highlights both the need for greater education among physicians and pregnant families, as well as the incremental opportunity for NIPT providers.","In China, our partners continue to grow their businesses, and the region remains the fastest growing for reproductive health testing. With approximately 4 million tests conducted each year, representing about 25% of births, we remain optimistic about growth.","In Europe, VeriSeq NIPT continues to perform well and delivered more than 50% revenue growth in the first quarter. Countries with notable updates included the Netherlands, associated with the progress of the ongoing TRIDENT study; France, now with national reimbursement for trisomy 21; and Germany, where a large lab network has adopted VeriSeq following a competitive render process.","In total, our CE-IVD VeriSeq NIPT offerings sequenced more than 100,000 samples in the first quarter, which compares to over 300,000 in all of 2018. Looking to 2019 and beyond, we expect the reimbursement landscape to continue to improve. Finally, our clinical application shipments also include genetic disease testing, which represents a little under 10% of 2018 sequencing consumable shipments. This category captures genetic disease, including neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and autoimmune testing.","Starting with genetic diseases, the clinical benefits of whole exome and whole genome sequencing for children and adults with undiagnosed genetic diseases are being studied more frequently than ever before.","It's still early days, but hospitals, such as the Institute for Genomic Medicine at Columbia University Urban Medical Center, are increasingly incorporating genetic testing. This can help patients receive a faster, more accurate diagnosis, which could lead to changing treatment.","In China, the government\u2019s focus on precision medicine and life sciences has generated positive momentum for genetic disease testing. Last year, the government released its first national list of 121 rare diseases to improve resources for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with genetic disease. With growing awareness, independent clinical labs, such as KingMed are providing more genetic disease testing and diagnostic services in China.","Their coverage is improving. For example, in the US, CMS\u2019s final clinical lab fee pricing for clinical whole genome sequencing went into effect at the end of 2018. This prices whole genome sequencing at more than $5,000 for a single genome for patients with undiagnosed diseases, this has resulted in certain Medicaid programs covering whole genome sequencing.","Additionally, the BlueCross BlueShield Association\u2019s Evidence Street program recently endorsed whole genome sequencing to improve clinical outcomes for children and critically ill infants with undiagnosed diseases. This positive endorsement is the first health technology Assessment Review for whole genome sequencing to-date.","Moving to research and applied, these applications represented approximately 60% of our sequencing consumable shipments in 2018 and grew approximately 18% from 2017. This category is split between genetic disease research, cancer research, cell and molecular research, and microbiology and other. Let me share a couple of examples. Researchers at the University of Copenhagen as part of a collaboration between Illumina and the Lundbeck Foundation are sequencing ancient DNA to understand mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia.","Also, the single cell NGS market continues to grow rapidly in the field of cell and molecular biology research. Publications continue to grow about 40% per year and are addressing key questions in developmental biology, immunology, neurology, and cancer. Next, advancements in liquid biopsy and the desire to better understand and characterize tumors continue to fuel cancer research with the goal of improving patient outcomes. Finally, we're seeing growth among our CRO customers who are supporting discovery phased research ahead of clinical trials.","Moving on, one focus area not included in these categories is population genomics. Depending on the objective of each program, population genomics revenue can be categorized as oncology or genetic disease in our research and applied category or more likely in the future oncology testing or genetic disease testing in our clinical category.","Momentum continues to build in population genomics. In 2019, France launched the first two pilot sites of its population genomics initiative, which was initially focused on 12 indications. In the US, [indiscernible] has enrolled over 200,000 participants, which is targeting 150,000 arrays and 25,000 genomes in year one. And the Million Veteran Program continues its efforts to sequence the whole genomes of 78,000 veterans.","The announcement of genomic [indiscernible] completing 100,000 genomes and the NHS incorporating whole genome sequencing into routine clinical care has generated strong momentum for others to ramp up their efforts. We continue to have productive conversations with population genomics initiatives around the world, most of which are still in the early planning stages.","Countries in emerging markets, such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Brazil, are now beginning to define the scope and priorities for their programs. Sequencing system revenue of $105 million was down as we expected following our record fourth quarter of 2018. NovaSeq orders were in line with our expectations, but timing of shipments pushed a handful of systems later in the year.","Most of our first quarter systems were shipped to high seat customers beginning their transition to NovaSeq. Approximately one quarter of NovaSeq orders were new to Illumina are straight from desktop customers. We continue to see a broad range of customer size, location, and application. For example, one customer purchased NovaSeq to build out a microbiome business and another customer purchased NovaSeq to support research on single cell RNA, b cell a d T cell receptors and whole exome and genome sequencing.","With the transition from HiSeq to NovaSeq progressing in line with our expectations, we have communicated to our customers that we will no longer be accepting HiSeq orders. As a result, we have seen a number of last time orders for refurbished HiSeq 4000s to be delivered throughout 2019. In the first quarter, we shipped six refurbished HiSeq 4000s. Separately, there were approximately 50 HiSeq decommissions in the first quarter.","Our desktop family, which includes the NextSeq to the HiSeq continue to deliver strong results. NextSeq and MiSeq placements saw year over year growth. With NextSeq strength in part driven by the demand for TSO500. HiSeq\u2019s affordability and accessibility continue to support customers across a wide range of applications, including on target CRISPR screening, environmental DNA sequencing, and 16S sequencing.","Moving to arrays, total revenue of $147 million was up 11% sequentially. Array consumables were down 15% from the same quarter a year ago, with growth in non-DTC customers partially offsetting a larger than expected decline in DTC revenue. Array service and other revenue of $66 million was up 14% from the same quarter a year ago and reflected a record number of array samples. But revenue was lower than we expected when we guided back in January.","Although we continue to see growth in DTC outside the US, we're factoring in even greater caution around the DTC business for the rest of 2019. The growth in DTC has been impressive over the last several years, with our US DTC customers creating new applications and now paving the way for the transition to higher value health-based offerings to extend the reach beyond their existing product portfolios. We believe the positive growth is transitional and expect growth to resume over time.","Before I hand the call over to Sam, I'm excited to share that we have taken the next step forward in our relationship with Helix, so that it can operate as an independent company with no equity or board participation from Illumina. This will allow Helix to pursue new opportunities both in population health initiatives and for its marketplace. Former Illumina executive Marc Stapley has been appointed CEO. And we wish Marc and the Helix team all the very best of luck. Helix will continue to leverage Illumina technology, and as such, we look forward to sharing in their success.","Sam?","Sam Samad","Thanks, Francis. As discussed, first quarter revenue grew 8% year-over-year to 846 million, driven by 11% growth in sequencing and slightly offset by a 3% decline in microarrays revenue. In terms of geographic performance, America's revenue of 473 million was up 8% year-over-year, driven primarily by our sequencing business, including sequencing consumable growth associated with clinical oncology applications. EMEA revenue of 210 million was up 8% year-over-year. Growth in sequencing consumables more than offset the expected decline in sequencing services associated with Joel during the transition to the National Health Service.","Our strategic focus in emerging markets such as the Middle East, Africa and Russia is showing early promise with a record number of sequencing systems and sequencing consumables delivered in the quarter. Greater China grew 13% year-over-year to 88 million, or 19%, allowing for the $5 million of stocking order that we shipped in the fourth quarter of 2018. Growth was driven primarily by sequencing consumables for NIPT and oncology applications in addition to arrays.","APJ grew 7% year-over-year to 75 million with growth driven by last service customers and oncology applications. Moving to sequencing, consumable revenue grew 14% from the same quarter a year ago to 481 million, or 15%, allowing for the 5 million stocking order that shipped in Q4. We did not receive any stocking orders in China in Q1.","From a pull-through perspective, NovaSeq pull through was approximately 1 million per system per year in 2018. And HiSeq was approximately 300,000 per system per year. Consistent with our prior practice, these pull through metrics reflect both system consumables and an allocation for library prep. We do not intend to update these on a quarterly basis, given the ongoing platform transition, but will provide pull through as part of our annual installed base update going forward.","That said, I will share that we expect NovaSeq pull through to increase as we progress through 2019. We started shipping the S prime flow sell in February, which offers more reads and a faster turnaround time at a lower price than HiSeq 2500. Demand has exceeded our expectations with over 100 customers ordering S prime in the quarter. Combined with the S1 and S2 price changes, this has opened or deepened many conversations with customers for NovaSeq conversions","Our mid throughput sequencing consumables associated with our NextSeq system grew 30% from the same quarter a year ago. Pull through is once again towards the high end of our previous pull through guidance range of 100,000 to 150,000. Now with 10 quarters of pull through consistently at the high end of our previous guidance range, we are revising our guidance range and now expect annual pull through for NextSeq system in the range of $130,000 to $160,000.","Moving to low throughput, pull through for MiSeq and MiniSeq was within our target ranges of $40,000 to $45,000 and $20,000 to $25,000 respectively. Array consumables declined 21 million sequentially, and were down 13 million or 15% compared to the first quarter of 2018. Sequencing service and other revenue of 113 million was up 9 million sequentially and up 18% year-over-year.","Higher revenue from oncology collaborations including a milestone payments and non-recurring IP license revenue more than offset the expected decline in GEL revenue. As you know, GEL completed the 100,000 genome program in late 2018. But we continue to work with GEL to sequence additional patients that were recruited for the program via the NHS.","Array services and other was up 41 million sequentially due to DTC seasonality and up 14% year-over-year. As Francis mentioned, this was a record quarter for DTC samples reported in array services and other, but revenue is lower than expected. Combined total consumables, services and other revenue, represented 87% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2019. This compares to 83% for the full year 2018.","Moving to systems, sequencing system revenue was down 56 million sequentially following our record fourth quarter and down 6% compared to the same period last year. Array systems were down 5 million sequentially and flat compared to the first quarter of 2018. Combined, instrument revenue represented 13% of total revenue in the quarter compared to 17% for the full year 2018. ","Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 70.2% was ahead of expectations and increased more than 100 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily driven by product mix and sequencing service and other revenue. Non-GAAP operating expenses of 363 million represented 43% of revenue, up from the first quarter of last year due to higher R&D investments. Non-GAAP operating margin was therefore 27.2%, down from 29.5% in Q1 of last year.","Excluding Helix, operating margin was 29.1% compared to 31.9% in Q1 of last year. The non-GAAP tax rate of 8.7% was down from last quarter, primarily due to a discrete tax benefit related to the release of tax reserves. And as expected, meaningfully lower versus our previously guided full year rate of 17%. For the first quarter of 2019, GAAP net income was 233 million or $1.57 per diluted share, and non GAAP net income was 237 million or $1 60 per diluted share.","Cash flow from operations was 198 million. DSO improved to 49 days from 54 days last quarter. First Quarter CapEx was 56 million and free cash flow was 142 million. In the first quarter, we repurchased 63 million of stock, leaving approximately 488 million available for share repurchases under the plan. We ended the first quarter with approximately 3.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short term investments.","The 2019 notes have been convertible since March 15 and will mature on June 15. We expect to repay the remaining 632 million principal in cash. The premium currently approximates 128 million for which we intend to issue stock that is already included in the diluted share count. In total, approximately 1 million shares are included in our Q1 diluted share count for the 2019 and 2021 notes. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 149 million.","Before I move to guidance, I'll touch on the impact of today's Helix announcement for the second quarter and full year. As a result of the announcement, Illumina will be de-consolidating Helix from its financial reports. At the start of the year, Illumina included approximately 19 million of revenue and approximately $0.02 of EPS dilution in our full year guidance. For the first quarter of 2019, Helix revenue was approximately 1 million and the EPS dilution was $0.05. April impact will be reported as part of our Q2 results, and is expected to include an additional $0.02 of dilution.","As a result, we are increasing our full year EPS guidance by the remaining $0.13 of previously expected Helix dilution. We now expect full year GAAP EPS in the range of $6.29 to $6.39 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $6.63 to $6.73. Our plan called for an additional 18 million of Helix revenue in 2019. At this time, we believe growth in our sequencing business can offset the loss of Helix revenue. And as a result, we are not changing our full year revenue guidance that calls for growth of 13% to 14% over 2018.","Moving to second quarter guidance, we expect revenue to grow approximately 7% compared to the second quarter of last year with higher sequencing revenue, driven by systems and consumables, more than offsetting lower array revenue driven by services and other. Combined with our first quarter results, and at the midpoint of our full year guidance range, you can see that we expect to deliver approximately 46% of our full year revenue in the first half of the year, and approximately 54% of full year revenue in the second half.","Back half revenue is driven predominantly by sequencing systems and consumables growth. We continue to expect sequencing consumable revenue growth to exceed 20% for the full year. And you can see from our first quarter results and second quarter guidance that this growth is also backend loaded.","For the full year overall, we expect growth rates to be similar to those we reported in 2018. Around 18% for research and applied sequencing consumables, and approximately 30% for clinical consumables. It's also worth keeping in mind that sequencing consumables for our largest customers are growing faster than the overall average. Revenue from our largest sequencing consumable customers, for example, grew more than 40% year-over-year in the first quarter. We expect this group to continue to outpace total sequencing consumable growth throughout 2019.","Moving to sequencing systems, excluding ICs, we expect to ship over 1150 systems in the second half of 2019 compared to approximately 930 systems in the first half. This includes NovaSeq where we expect to ship more than two times the number of NovaSeqs in the fourth quarter compared to the first quarter.","Most of our sequencing consumable growth will be associated with ramping sample volumes among existing customers. At the same time, however, there are a number of specific initiatives that we expect we\u2019ll be scaling in the back half of the year. For example, we believe whole genome sequencing for the all of us program will be ramping in the second half of the year. In the UK, we expect the National Health Service to start scaling whole genome sequencing and there are other population genomics initiatives, including many in pilot phase that will start or will continue to ramp in the back half.","Combined, the timing of population genomics initiatives are expected to contribute approximately 55 million of growth in the second half compared to the first half. Excluding this group, our revenue split would be closer to 47% in the first half, and 53% in the second, highlighting that population genomics initiatives are amplifying the back half loading this year.","For the full year, we continue to expect revenue growth in the range of 13% to 14% with strength in our sequencing business, offsetting the shortfalls associated with the transition in DTC and the loss of Helix revenue. We therefore continue to expect our sequencing business to grow in the mid-teens and now expect our array business to be approximately flat year-over-year.","Reflecting the de-consolidation of Helix, we now expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be flat to slightly down compared to the 70.1% reported for the full year 2018. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses, as a percentage of revenue, to improve by approximately 2 percentage points compared to 2018. And non-GAAP operating margin is now also expected to improve from the 27.9% reported in 2018.","For the full year, we expect the tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to grow approximately 7% from the second quarter of 2018. We expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 12% year-over-year with growth in both sequencing systems and sequencing consumables. We expect arrays to decline in the mid-teens year-over-year on a percentage basis, reflecting lower array service and other revenue.","Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be down on a sequential basis due to product mix and Q1 non-recurring revenue and sequencing service and other. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase slightly on a sequential basis as a percent of revenue due to timing of OpEx spend shifting from Q1 to Q2, partially offset by lower expenses as a result of the Helix de-consolidation. We expect other income to decline sequentially due to debt repayment. ","With that, I'll hand the call back to Francis for some closing remarks before we open it up for questions. Francis?","Francis deSouza","Thank you, Sam. A few closing remarks before we open it up for questions. First, we remain confident in the trajectory and speed of the multi-year NovaSeq transition. We are very pleased with the progress among our still to convert HiSeq customers and expect closer to 50% of the original installed base will have started or completed their conversions by the end of the year.","We're seeing momentum across a broad range of sequencing applications. Q1 saw a promising data for liquid biopsy and TMB for example. And while it's early days, we're very pleased with the initial feedback and growing demand we're seeing for TSO500. Additionally, we continue to see positive coverage decisions in clinical oncology, genetic disease and reproductive health testing.","We're also seeing momentum in population genomics with initiatives around the world looking to build on the experience of GEL to deliver powerful genomic insights for their populations. It will take time, but the path is increasingly well defined. To best enable our sequencing and array customers in both the clinical and research markets, Illumina invested 20% in R&D for the first quarter to support the most exciting portfolio of innovations we've ever had. We remain committed to delivering the most innovative and effective platforms available, supported by a world class service organization that delivers and serves more than 6,300 customers and 13,000 systems in 90 countries.","Later this year, we expect to close the acquisition of Pacific Biosciences and look forward to sharing more information on our plans at that time. Combining the two technologies positions us to reach more applications, accelerate the pace of genomic discovery and bolster our innovation engine, which has been a hallmark of Illumina since our inception. We're excited about bringing together highly accurate short and long read sequencing technologies, which will pave the path to a more perfect view of a genome. Certainly, I can't think of a more exciting time for the PacBio team to be joining the Illumina family, and I look forward to welcoming them this summer.","With that, I'll open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, guys and appreciate all the super helpful color. Maybe just starting on sort of the obvious in terms of instruments on the sequencing side, obviously, you gave the order commentary and gave us some helpful thoughts around, Sam, sort of the 4Q versus 1Q dynamic in terms of some of the number of placements, I guess, as we just think about that second half ramp, and obviously, the waiting here being a little bit atypical versus maybe last year, of the pieces you gave us are up some of the parts that are moving into the back half, how much of that is do you have, like, you know, a very high line of sight to and then how much of it would you say maybe there's sort of a moderate confidence interval and then where if anywhere does any sort of risk play in, in terms of levels. I'm just trying to get a sense for the sort of visibility to some of the different drivers because it is sometimes hard for us, particularly on some of these pop studies to understand the cadence. And so any color just around sort of where you've got ultimate visibility versus not would be, I think, super helpful.","Francis deSouza","Sure, Ross. I\u2019ll start by saying that, overall, we feel really good about our pipeline, as we look at the rest of the year. And we believe the pipeline is there to support the 13% to 14% growth we talked about. In terms of some of the bigger deals that we talked about in the script that are in the back half of the year, as you can imagine, we are deeply engaged with a lot of the population genomics efforts underway. So all of us here in the US, both GEL and the NHS in the UK, the population deal in France and Singapore and Dubai and so on. ","So we have teams that are deeply engaged and have been working with those initiatives now for some time. As you can imagine, with each of those deals, there are a number of moving parts that have to be lined up. So there is always the chance to deals move a little bit. But at this point, we have very high confidence that the deals will happen. And while there may be some flex in terms of the timing when they launch, we have a lot of confidence that, a, they'll happen and b, they'll be of the size and scale that they've been talking about. So we've been deeply engaged and we have very high line of sight into those initiatives only out.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel","I'd like to maybe take a different shot at trying to unpack the pacing of full year guidance and really the logic behind it. So specifically on sequencing consumables, sequencing consumables grew 14% in the first quarter, that was a bit better than we expected, even adjusted for some of the new ways that you're reporting sequencing this quarter, basically consolidating the other line there. So that's obviously a positive. At the same time, you're guiding us to assume that sequencing consumables will grow 20% or more for the year. So mathematically, this would require 25% growth over the balance of the year in this category, comparisons don't get easier until Q4, you guided Q2 probably a little bit below what we were looking for. ","Again, recognizing all the details that are new that you provided, which are helpful, I'm just wondering if you can help us understand what gives you the continued confidence that you can get to that 20% sequencing consumables growth number for the year. You mentioned, PopSeq, if we pulled that all into sequencing, and it may not all be there. But if all of that comes in in the second half in sequencing, which I think you said is 55 million incremental, that's six points of growth over H2 of last year. So I don't think that alone is enough to get you there. So what specifically are you seeing, because that continues to be the biggest question we're getting, and I think the biggest overhang for the year? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Yeah, so let me start Doug by addressing that. So, with regards to Q1, yes, as you mentioned, we grow 14% in terms of sequencing consumables. As we look at Q2, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our expectation for sequencing as a whole is to grow in the, essentially the low double digits or approximately 12%. If you also exclude some of the one-time factors that we had in Q2 related to some tariff stocking, that sequencing consumable growth in the second quarter is improved by roughly three percentage points. In sequencing as a whole, we expect that business to grow by about 15% in the second quarter. ","Now, as you think about the ramp in the second half, obviously, as we've talked about in the prepared remarks, there's a significant ramp in the second half. You would say, I mean, traditionally, we've probably been in more the 48% to 52% in the second half, building in terms of revenues. Right now, we're saying it's more 46% to 54%. But if you factor in the ramp from some of the population genomics initiative, it probably normalizes closer to 47% to 53%.","With regards to some of the things that are going to drive that backend loading or some of the improvements in sequencing consumables in the second half, obviously, the ramp in terms of instrument placements is back end loaded as well and that's going to carry with it consumable utilization. And we are seeing very strong consumable utilization across our instruments. I mentioned the NovaSeq pull through number, which was $1 million in 2018. We expect that to improve as we go forward. So that's our expectation, and we see no reason to not expect that.","And then the other metric that I mentioned, actually, another couple of metrics that I mentioned, one was around our, I would say, our largest customers and those are experiencing a 40% growth in terms of sequencing consumables across their clinical application. So that's a significant growth, we're seeing very, very strong utilization in those group of customers. And then the last one is around some of the metrics that we mentioned overall around clinical utilization and growth in sequencing consumables across clinical. For 2018, that was a growth of 30%. For Q1, that was actually a growth of over 20%. And we expect that for the full year to grow in line with what we saw in 2018.","And again, we're seeing some very strong indications with the applications that we see that are growing in clinical. So we feel really bullish about the second half. Obviously, it's a steep path, as we talked about, but we have very good indications for the achievability of it.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan.","Tycho Peterson","I want to start with instruments again. Looking at your guidance for the quarter, you did still come up a little bit short by about 6 million versus what you've guided to. And, I know you said NovaSeq orders were in line with expectations. But I'm just curious if you could elaborate a little bit, you called out some slippage in installations. Basically, I'm just trying to get comfortable that, it's really a timing issue as opposed to anything in particular around competitive pressures. And then I'm curious Francis, if you can just talk on the reception to the S1 and S2 close out pricing changes and then also how S prime is maybe changing the discussions with the HiSeq customers?","Francis deSouza","Yeah, definitely. So I'll start by saying that, we had expected as we talked about a decline in sequencing instruments shipments, about 50 million between Q4 and Q1 and it came in about 56 million short. So, again, given the seasonality we did expect that decline. In NovaSeq specifically, I talked about the fact that from an orders perspective, we came in slightly ahead of expectations. Then we had a handful of instruments that are going to be shipping later this year. So they shipped out of this quarter.","In terms of NovaSeq as a whole, obviously, we don't give out quarterly shipment numbers. But we are very happy with how the NovaSeq upgrade continues to play out. And we have good visibility into the shipments for the rest of 2019. We entered this year, as you know, with about 25% of the HiSeq customers having started their transitions, only 25% have started it all, the transition into NovaSeq. And as you can imagine, the first wave of adopters of NovaSeq were the large service providers, the large genome centers. So coming into this year with the launch of S prime and the adjustment in pricing for S1 and S2, really one of the stories for us this year is the activation of the smaller high throughput labs on that upgrade journey. And then that was exactly the intent of S prime that's wanting us to too.","And that's starting to play out. So we saw that play out in the quarter. That pricing was well received. And I talked about some of the examples of customers that were still running the legacy HiSeq systems and were waiting for the price points at which they could move to the NovaSeq. So there was the customers that were running desktop instruments plus some of the older HiSeq instruments, and that's starting to play out. So what we expect then over the course of this year is to catalyze that group of customers and really get at the next 25% of the HiSeq installed base to get to upgrade over the course of this year. ","We expect the NovaSeq shipments to have a steep ramp over the course of the year. So in Q4, we expect to ship twice as many instruments for example, as we ship in Q1 of this year. So we expect that ramp and all that we think will sort of roll into a NovaSeq shipments number for the year that's flat to slightly up from last year. So very consistent with the multi-year upgrade thesis we had when we first launched NovaSeq.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Mike on for Derik. I had a quick question. Just want to follow up on some of the topics that you've touched on with the NovaSeq, you mentioned particular strength in the NextSeq and you notably upped the pull through range on that, which granted has been running pretty high for a while. I'm just wondering if, you know, do you think you've seen some possible trade down from the HiSeqs, customers that were sort of on the bubble of being a high throughput and a medium throughput, instead of moving to the NovaSeq, they\u2019ve decided to use the NextSeq at a higher level. And also, you noted that you're no longer accepting orders for HiSeqs. I'm wondering, how that plays out into your thoughts on the NovaSeq upgrade cycle if that could add a boost this year?","Francis deSouza","Sure. So coming into the NovaSeq upgrade cycle, as we looked at the HiSeq installed base in its entirety, we always expected a small portion of them to move to the NextSeq rather than NovaSeq, but we thought that would be a small portion and that the vast majority of the HiSeq install base would move to the NovaSeq and that really is how it's playing out. We're also starting to see customers that were purely desktop customers and I mentioned one in the script that are now buying NovaSeqs as the -- their volume of business grows. And the other dynamic that we didn't quite expect as well as it did was as we're seeing a quarter of all NovaSeq orders coming from new to sequencing customers and so that played out a little bit better than we expected.","NextSeq continues to be a workforce instrument. We did raise the range for its pull through, because we've seen pull through at the high end of the previous range now for many, many quarters. It continues to be the workhorse in the clinical customer base, and people especially like the DX availability as well. So we continue to see strength in NextSeqs and NextSeqs and MiSeqs both were up year on year in terms of shipments of instruments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","Bill Quirk","Question regarding the -- just again, kind of going back to guidance, Francis, just help us think a little bit about, are you dialing anything into the expectations for items where Illumina has a little less control over the situation and examples that come to mind to be things like ACOG endorsement for average risk or say the timing of oncology test approvals by some of your customers, for example, and then separately, staying on the FDA for a moment, when should we anticipate the TSO500 approval? Thanks, guys.","Francis deSouza","Sure, so if we look at how we built up our revenue expectation for the year, we haven't built in really expectations around any material changes around ACOG guidelines over the course of the year. Momentum for those guidelines to change continues to build and we do believe that ultimately they will be supportive of average risk testing, but we haven't built that into our expectations over the course of this year. And neither have we built in on the oncology side, any dramatic changes either in the reimbursement environment or the regulatory environment. ","In terms of FDA approval, we were very excited that after we launched TSO500, we got breakthrough designation by the FDA. What that means is we are on an expedited path to get approval from the FDA for TSO500. And so, if we're doing the work with them, as you know, if you get breakthrough designation, that means that you have dedicated resources from the FDA, you can work with them on an expedited basis. You can design the data that you need with them up front before you turn it in. And so, we're continuing to move down that path, as quickly as we can. ","In addition, we're also continuing to move down the path of having TSO500 be a companion diagnostic for the therapies associated with the partnerships that we signed up. So for example, the two therapies from BMS, and there, we achieved an important milestone in our partnership with them in Q1. So that continues to move forward well as well.","Sam Samad","Maybe just to add one quick thing, though, as I mentioned earlier, the second half ramp that we have and which is essentially a driver of guidance for the year and a precondition for us, hitting guidance for the year is really driven off of the sequencing consumable utilization run rates and expectations that we are seeing. So when we talked about the 2018, for instance, 30% growth in sequencing consumables in clinical applications, that's the expectation for the second half. ","Having said this, there is a portion that I talked about in the prepared remarks, which is contingent on population genomics initiatives. And those are in various degrees. Some are underway and some will ramp in the second half and I refer to 55 million in terms of second half versus first half growth.","So obviously, when you have population genomics initiatives, which, essentially you have to work with different governments and involve multiple stakeholders, and in some cases, regulatory approvals, there is a level of uncertainty with those. But at this point, there is nothing to lead us to believe that those are not going to materialize in the second half. And we feel strongly about that.","Francis deSouza","And I just wanted to comment, TSO500 REO is available today. So while we're continuing to work with the FDA on getting an IVD, TSO500 REO is available and shipping today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS.","Dan Brennan","Just had a two parter kind of on NovaSeq as we look out to the second half of the year. Francis, could you just help us think about in terms of that S 1 and S prime opportunity amongst your 800 customers, how many of those are represented by like the smaller labs, excuse me, that are targets for S1 and S prime and then sorry, just to clarify, apologize if you said this already. But when we think about the doubling of placements in the fourth quarter, how much of that is actually expected to actually come from these top 6 programs buying? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Sure. So let me start with the NovaSeq question. So look, when we looked at the installed base of HiSeq and HiSeq, about 850 customers, as we started the upgrade cycle from NovaSeq, less than 50 of those were customers that also had the HiSeq X. And so those were the customers that were the very large service providers, the very large genome centers. And so, 800 out of the 850 were not of that scale. And so, S prime and S1, S2 are very important to a very big part of the HiSeq install base.","Until S prime shipped, actually, if you were a HiSeq 2500 customer, and you weren't running, a large degree of samples, it was hard for you to make the economic case so that you get paid back in a reasonable time. But now with S prime, you can make the case where you will see pay back in the one to two year period, depending on your sample volume. And so now with the current sort of portfolio, we are making the case that resonates with that large part of the install base. And I said one of the stories of 2019 is going to be the activation of that large segment of the HiSeq installed base to begin the upgrade.","So that was the first question. What was the second?","Sam Samad","So the second was around how much of the Q4 additional NovaSeq placements or the doubling of NovaSeq placements versus Q1 is related to PopGen. I believe that was the question and listen, the expectation is, obviously, that we have a ramp in the second half in terms of instrument placements versus the first half and we talked about the Q4 versus Q1 NovaSeq placements, there is a portion of this related to some PopGen initiatives, but a lot of it is also driven by seasonality, as you know, from Q4 2018, we had record number of NovaSeq placements in Q4 of 2018. And we expect a similar pattern in Q4 2019.","Francis deSouza","So if I look into and all that, I\u2019d say, we came into this year with 25% of the HiSeq installed base having begun that upgrade process. We expect to exit this year with another 25% having engaged and either completed or begun the upgrade process. A significant percentage of those will be the smaller high throughput genome centers for whom S prime, S1, S2 will be very important. There will be though other important segments. We continue to see a quarter of orders for NovaSeq coming from new to alumina, for example, and there will be capacity adds from the larger centers that have already bought their first NovaSeqs, but are adding additional NovaSeqs as they moved around and samples over from their HiSeqs. You'll also start to see the effect of some of the large funding program like TopMed, sort of switch from being a headwind to the upgrade to NovaSeq to being more of a tailwind. And that'll play out too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink.","Puneet Souda","Thanks for the details. My question is around PopSeq specifically, in terms of, what's your assumption built in here for the genome cost? And, how do you see that driving an increasing level of adoption into PopSeq market longer term? I mean, I appreciate your comments around 55 million, but just hoping to understand this PopSeq growth in the context of the $100 genome that you've talked about in past and anything around the timing associated with that. ","And just a second part of the question is largely around consumer genomics. How do you see that market evolving here? Do you see this market shifting away from more of a consumer health demand to a more robust consumer health product, where customers are demanding more accurate data, more decision making healthcare data, is that's what's slowing down some of the growth that you pointed out? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Sure. So I\u2019ll start with the population genomics customers sets and -- the potential customers that that we were talking to and pricing associated with that. So we have a pricing model that we put together that rewards customers for being higher volume customers. So the level of discount you can achieve gets greater, the more you commit on the instrument side and on the consumable side as well. But it is a single matrix that we use with the different customers that we talk to. And so, we're very transparent about what the pricing looks like and how different customers can achieve different tiers of discounts.","Today, some of the largest customers, as you know, are already at below $1,000 a genome. And so there's room to give them additional discounts below what they can do today to enable those very large scale efforts. However, even at the very larger scale, they're not yet at the stage where they're getting to $100 genome. So that's still in front of us. But there are volume discounts. ","Now, in terms of the dynamic playing out in the consumer business, what we are seeing in the consumer business is really the market for health applications starting to build and the market really moving from being a pure genealogy market, where a lot of the growth was driven over the last few years to being more of a health market and so that market is in transition. Ultimately, the health market is a much bigger market than the genealogy market, we believe. ","And so we expect that growth to continue and to resume once that transition, you know, really gets underway. And that's what we believe we're seeing. The other dynamic that's in play is that, if you looked at the DTC genomics business, really over the last few years, it's been dominated by two, maybe three players in the US, right. And now we're seeing a lot more players emerge around the world. And so that market is going to be a lot less concentrated going forward, both in terms of geography and in terms of customers, as we look at 2020 and beyond.","Operator","And our next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly","Maybe just on the HiSeq transition over to Nova, now that you're not accepting HiSeq orders anymore, perhaps accelerating the transition over to Nova, how do you ensure there's no air pocket on the consumables as an elevated number of these HiSeq users shift over to Novas and get those new systems up to speed?","And then are you seeing any users with multiple HiSeqs Seas consolidate down to just one Nova? Or has it been more one for one on a conversion ratio?","Francis deSouza","Our experience so far and we shared some of the data a little while ago was that customers that have both a HiSeq and NovaSeq, they were HiSeq customers, and they purchase NovaSeq, spend more with us on average than they did before. And so we did an analysis and we shared that data a little while ago. And so that's what we expect to continue to see that if you are a large research customer, and you get a grant, with NovaSeq, what you are looking to do is power your experiments better. And so, you will still spend the grant money that you have, but you will just do a bigger experiment. ","It also has allowed people to define more ambitious experiments either in terms of using new paradigms like single cell or an analysis for example. If you're starting to see the design of bigger experiments, as customers and researchers start to think about how they can use the additional power of the NovaSeq. So it has not been the experience we've had so far that customers experience that air pocket in any significant way. And in fact, that was our thesis going in that there is elasticity in this market based on what our customers have told us and that they wanted the additional power of NovaSeq to do bigger experiments. ","In terms of the ratios, one of the things we said coming into the NovaSeq upgrade cycle is that it's probably not the right way to think about it in terms of a ratio of HiSeqs to NovaSeq, probably the better way to think about it is number of customers out, right. So you have the 850 customers I talked about, start from that number and work out rather than taking the total number of HiSeqs and work back. And so -- and that's been our experience now as it's played out that, customers fundamentally do more work with a NovaSeq than they were able to do with a HiSeq. And so it's not just a straight ratio that they're applying.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard","So just a quick modeling question for Sam and then a philosophical follow up for Francis. So first off on modeling. Sam, can you disclose how much of the sequencing service revenue in a quarter was one time, you mentioned a milestone payment and a non-recurring IP payment? That would be helpful as I'm trying to assess the core run rate?","And then secondly, philosophically, Francis, how are you thinking about operating leverage going forward? And I'm asking because SG&A came in, while our model was down sequentially, which is not very usual, you\u2019re de-consolidating Helix which allowed you to raise EPS guide, is there more operating leverage or more of an operating leverage angle to this story going forward and perhaps people appreciate it.","Francis deSouza","So let me start with the modeling one, Dan. So we haven't disclosed exactly how much that licensing revenue amount is. But think about it this way in terms of Q1. We, if you think about it sequentially from Q4, we did have a drop off in that sequencing and other related to the GEL revenues that -- with the completion of the 100,000 project. We did expect and had the drop off in terms of GEL revenues. The drop off wasn't as much as we expected, because there are still some samples being sequenced in GEL, they have collected more samples, and they're still utilizing or doing sequencing on those samples. And then the other two large components I would say is we had some milestone payments related to some of our oncology collaboration. So that was another piece of it. And then there was the licensing IP revenues as well. That's another piece of it. So those were the three key factors that you would say, a drop off in terms of the GEL revenues and an offsetting and increase in terms of the milestone payments and the licensing revenues.","Now, in terms of philosophy, the philosophy has not changed. Our philosophy, fairly consistently over the years, has been that over a multi-year period, you should expect leverage from our business. And that continues to be true. Having said that, at any given time, we look at what the best uses of our capital is. And since we're in the midst for example of an innovation cycle, you'll see us spend more against those priorities and you've seen that play out with NovaSeq, you saw that play out before with the HiSeq X and NextSeq and so where we feel there is an opportunity to expand the market to significantly improve the size of the market because of the elasticity, increase our competitive position, we will spend to do that.","For example, you saw what we\u2019re doing with PacBio, that's a good example of a complementary set of technologies that we think our customers would value. But over a multi-year period, we do believe that there is operating leverage in the business. It's also good. And I guess it's appropriate that we're doing this call on DNA day today, celebrating the 66th anniversary of the publication of the structure of the DNA molecule. And as we -- and 16 years, I guess, since we published the human genome, as we reflect back on all the progress of the 66 years, it truly is remarkable how much has been achieved. But it's truly astounding how much is still in front of us. Less than 0.01% of all species have ever been sequenced, even once, less than 0.02% of people have ever been sequenced. And so there's still this tremendous opportunity in front of us. And so we want to make sure that we continue to deliver the innovations that allow us to capture that market.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity.","Mark Massaro","So the beat relative to our model in the quarter was driven by services in other in particular, in microarrays. But, you certainly are taking a more cautious stance on arrays. So I guess my first question is, with the record number of DTC samples, but lower revenue than expected, can you just speak to the pricing dynamic? And if you expect pricing, maybe to get worse from here. And then, Francis, I guess, there's a lot left to be desired to explain why there's been sort of a dislocation in DTC. So what gives you confidence that this transition will impact return to growth say in 2020.","Francis deSouza","So let me start with the first part of that, Mark, and thanks for the question. The beat was actually on a couple of fronts. So let me punctuate sort of the quarter. Sequencing consumables in Q1 came in better than expected. So that was a part of the beat, that was a large part of the beat. Sequencing and other revenues also came in stronger than expected. And I mentioned a couple of factors there. One was related to some licensing IP revenues that came in, that was more timing driven. The other one was driven by some GEL set samples still being sequenced, albeit less than what we had in 2018. ","But still they have not gone down to zero. And actually, we saw some other microarray strength as well in the quarter. This is outside of DTC, but other microarray coming in better than expected. Now, on the other side, in terms of on the negative side, as we mentioned on the call, sequencing instruments were slightly lower than expected, and that was driven by mostly the handful of NovaSeq shipments that got pushed out as well as DTC revenues coming in lower than expected. ","So as Francis mentioned, yes, we did have record DTC samples processed in the quarter, as you would expect in Q1 that\u2019s usually a very strong quarter in Q1, because you have all of the samples and all of the kicks that get returned to us and get sampled and processed. But it was still weaker than we expected, given that it's Q1 and given that Q1 is the largest quarter. So there isn't really much of a pricing dynamic playing here, it was just again, our expectations were the Q1 would be X and it came in slightly lower. And hence, we're taking an even more cautious view for the year on DTC.","Sam Samad","And then in terms of the look forward, we've earned into a really fortunate position where we work very closely with the pioneers that have created effectively the consumer DTC space, right. So it is the 23andmes and the ancestries and the other players that are really pioneering this category. And we spend, as you can imagine time with them, and we work very closely with them to understand the dynamics of the market as they're evolving, and we've done that, frankly, since those companies effectively got into DNA testing. ","And so, we have their information around how the markets evolving, and they were the ones who called it to say, look, the market is moving from a genealogy market to a healthcare market. They were expecting the slowdown as it played out and split up maybe a little bit more of a slowdown than expected, but frankly the direction is what they said. They also are sharing the data with us on why they believe, and what they're seeing in terms of updates of health offerings, and why they believe that's an exciting market going forward. And so, part of our planning is to work with them on their forecasts. ","In addition, we're seeing demand from outside the US DTC customers and so even, there's this data that in terms of real customers were signing up, we've talked about well over 100 customers now, outside the US in the DTC space, and they're going to continue to grow and at some point, they will be big enough to be a material driver of the overall growth in that space, and it makes intuitive sense, right. There's no reason why consumer genomics is a purely American phenomena and why people in the UK or China or Japan or Australia won't also care about the same things that people care about here. And so we're seeing that data. And intuitively it makes sense that the same phenomenon that played out here will start to play out outside the US.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays.","Jack Meehan","Thank you. Francis, I was hoping you'd give us an update on the PacBio side. We\u2019ve seen the headlines related to the UK CMA, just how do you think the deal is progressing on the regulatory front? Do you think you can resolve the concerns and what's feedback been around market sizing and competition? Thanks.","Francis deSouza","Yes, sure. So we are, as you know, engaged with both the CMA and the SEC here in the US and that process is going as expected. In the US, we've gone into the second request starting at the beginning of the year. And in the UK, we have completed our filing. And as expected, the CMA is going into its investigative phase. That is standard. I know it got covered by the press as though, sort of an unexpected investigation. That is a standard part of the process. And so, from our perspective, we are very comfortable with where we are in the process. We are where we expected to be, and we expect to close in the middle of the summer.","Operator","Thank you.

I\u2019m delighted to report that Q2 was another exceptional quarter for the company. Our business continued to demonstrate strong underlying trends across all geographies in nearly all products lines. As a result, Q2 revenue increased 29% year-over-year to $448 million, our 11th consecutive quarter sequential revenue growth and our best year-over-year growth rate since Q2 2011.","Second quarter total sequencing revenue grew 44% year-over-year, driven by impressive demand for consumables, our new instruments and NIPT testing. These results clearly demonstrate the breadth of our portfolio with options for customers across all experimental scales and applications.","Sequencing instrument revenue grew 51% compared to the second quarter of 2013, fueled by strong demand for HiSeq X Ten and the NextSeq 500 while MiSeq and HiSeq also exceeded in our expectations.","Once again, cannibalization between our systems was insignificant and will be relevant looking forward as manufacturing processes for each product are equivalently scalable including HiSeq X Ten.","As you all know, manufacturing capacity for HiSeq X Ten have been governed by supply of the high resolution cameras and the pattern flow cells.","As we begin the second quarter, volume production of the pattern flow cells had only recently begun but I\u2019m pleased to report this process has steadily improved and we no longer expect flow cell production to be a gaining factor for HiSeq X shipments.","As the result of this progress, we recorded revenue on a significantly higher number of HiSeq Xs in Q2 compared to Q1. We anticipate the future shipment rate to be largely determined by our customers\u2019 readiness to absorb the systems which we expect will extend into the first half of 2015 for announced deals.","The unprecedented demand for HiSeq X Ten has exceeded our most aggressive assumptions and moving into Q3, I\u2019m pleased to report this trend continued.","Since the last earnings call, we\u2019ve received four additional orders. The first from the Baylor College of Medicine and the second from Sidra Medical and Research Center as well as two additional customers who have chosen not to be disclosed at this time. These additional orders bring our HiSeq X Ten customer count to 13 for a total of 144 HiSeq Xs.","We\u2019re no longer planning to necessarily announce each order as individually, they\u2019re not material given our large shippable backlog.","That being said, we have a strong funnel of opportunities for the remainder of this year and into mid-2015.","Both the Genomics England and the Sidra Medical and Research Center announcements highlight that population sequencing as beginning an earnest.","We are very pleased to recently disclose alongside Genomics England that Illumina Cambridge will be the preferred partner for the sequencing portion of the 100,000 Genome\u2019s program.","While there are not many details I can share about our role in this project today, we are working towards a definitive agreement and we\u2019ll be happy to provide additional information when possible.","The creation of a High-Throughput Genomics Center at Sidra Medical and Research Center in Qatar is another notable milestone for population studies. The center will focus on human whole-genome sequencing for rare genetic disease in addition toward their work on population studies. The facility will help advance genetic mapping projects including the creation of Arab consensus genome. This population sequencing program are just two of the many that are being discussed globally and we look forward to providing further updates as these projects reach greater maturity.","Overall demand for the HiSeq family of products has increased over the last few quarters and this trend continued in Q2. Shipments were higher both sequentially and year-over-year as ASP is improved due to customer purchases shifting toward HiSeq 2500 and X Ten and away from HiSeq 1500 and 2000. Demand for the HiSeq 2500 benefited from 10 multiunit orders including HiSeq X Ten customers looking to supplement their fleet for application outside whole-genome sequencing.","Approximately half of the HiSeq 2500 demand came from existing customers looking to build out capacity and gain access to the one terabase or 1T chemistry. We begin see evidence of an upgrade cycled during the quarter as customers with older generation instruments placed HiSeq orders to capture the benefits of the 1T.","We expect this trend to continue over the next year or two as customers with older generation HiSeq instruments assess our portfolio to determine which instrument would be optimal given their applications, workflow and economics. Approximately one-third of 1T eligible instruments have purchased the required upgrade and we expect this figure to increase dramatically in the third quarter.","In Q2, we reached the historic milestone for HiSeq products as we surpassed 2 billion in shipments since inception, cementing HiSeq as the most successful next generation sequencer ever. HiSeq 2500 remains a very important part of our instrument portfolio with a long road map ahead of it including regulatory clearance and read length enhancements.","One of such enhancement, the 2x250 read length kits will ship in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re on track to submit the HiSeq NIPT assay to the FDA. Additionally the TruSeq Synthetic Long-Read kits are now shipping. Based on the molecular technology we acquired in 2013, this kit includes the streamlined library prep method with master mix reagents, improved chemistry to reduce bias and integration with BaseSpace to enable a full sample to answer workflow generating high quality virtual reads of up to 10kb. This new library prep kit works across a much broader set of applications including genome finishing, metagenomics, de novo assembly, meta assembly and human genome phasing.","Moving to NextSeq, our product launch activities continue to generate significant interest resulting in sequentially higher orders and shipments in Q2. Importantly, NextSeq is to say the sweet spot with oncology, NIPT and microbiology customers to do the breadth applications and the flexibility of the workflow. As an illustration of this, half of orders came from commercial customers made which are exploring the use of NextSeq in a translational or clinical production setting.","Feedback on NextSeq continues to be very favorable due in part to the exceptional performance to the instrumenting customer hands. Both quality scores and output are exceeding specifications as we\u2019re regularly seeing greater than 85% Q30 performance and selective runs approaching a 140G. This along with yearly customer data has support and demand for NextSeq and we look-forward to a continued successful rollout of this instruments.","Cannibalization of my MiSeq by NextSeq was insignificant again in this quarter as the platform is uniquely suited for particular applications and customer groups. MiSeq orders benefited from our trade in program for the third party instruments as well as a bundling promotion which offers a discount to customer when both NextSeq and MiSeq are purchased together.","Customer dynamics for MiSeq are largely unchanged from the trends we saw in prior quarters with approximately two-third of instruments ordered y government, commercial, translational and clinical customers. And close to 70% of the orders from new customers. Additionally this quarter, we once again received follow on multiunit orders from existing customers building capacity and production facilities and from public health institutions including the FDA and the CDC.","Moving now to arrays, this quarter total micro array revenue declined approximately 10% year-over-year as growth in genotyping services in IVF was more than offset by a decline in our Infinium genotyping business. This was primarily due to the completion of a large multiyear biobanking project and lower demand from a consumer customer as supposed to exchange in our market share which we estimate to be stable at approximately 80% of the genotyping market.","As a result, we\u2019re updating our expectations for the array business in 2014. The impact of which is included in the guidance we provided today.","For the full year, we now expect this business to be down mid to high single digits due in part to factors noted previously as well as the absence of revenue from our Eco PCR products which were previously reported in the array line.","Beyond 2014, we expect this business to stabilize if not grow due to the impact of consumer, agriculture and IVF demand. We remain focused on delivering complete sample answered workflows enabling new markets to embrace NGS technology to a variety of applications. As part of our strategy, we continue to enhance our bioinformatics capability. BaseSpace now has a total of 38 apps and we\u2019re tracking to having approximately 50 available by year-end.","During the quarter, we also enhanced the BaseSpace onsite product which now includes our Variance studio analysis tool and native apps which previously had only been available in the cloud offering of BaseSpace. Our sampled answer product announced at the General Investor Day remain on track for delivery this year and we look forward to updating you on a demand transfer in NeoPrep and MiSeq Forensics over the coming quarters.","As a demonstration of the diversification of our business, again, this quarter commercial non-profit and hospital customers accounted for approximately half of the shipments. In the Americas, clinical orders grew more than 50% in the first half versus the prior year.","Sequencing uptake in the ecology market also continues to gain significant traction. In the second quarter sales to research, translational and clinical oncology customers, grew more than 30% versus the prior year to approach $90 million in shipments.","Our efforts to bolster adoption in the field are also progressing well. The actionable genome consortium which consists of the major cancer centers as well as other key stakeholders including Illumina has reached consensus on a broad set of standards for using NGS in the clinic and plans to publish their recommendations next year.","Feedback from customers points to standards being a critical factor to drive the adoption of NGS in the clinic. Additionally, we continue to further our discussions with pharma partners regarding the development of our onco panel and hope we have announced Mr. Shera [ph] on this topic in the coming quarters.","This week, Dr. Tina Nova joined Illumina as the general manager of Oncology Business. Tina is a great addition to our team and we\u2019re delighted to have her onboard. Her group will execute on this strategic vision. Dr. Richard Klausner has put in place a CMO and interim general manager of oncology. I\u2019d like to thank Rick for the dynamic leadership he provided over the last six months in this acting role.","As part of our clinical array and strategy, we recently completed the acquisition of Myraqa, a regulatory and quality consulting firm specializing in IVD and companion diagnostics. The team is nationally recognized due to their deep regulatory quality, clinical, biostatistics and IVD development expertise.","As we move into the clinical market, obtaining regulatory approval for our products and the products of our partners has become increasingly important. With the addition of Myraqa, our regulatory team has now tripled in size allowing us to run abroad parallel portfolio of regulatory products through our pipeline.","Myraqa accelerates our vision of advancing the adoption of genomics in the clinic and we\u2019re very pleased to welcome Maya Tomay [ph] and her team to Illumina. The financial impact of this transaction was included in the guidance we provided in April.","In reproductive and genetic health, we made significant progress during the second quarter in both IVF and NIPT. We successfully launched our new preimplantation generic screening product, VeriSeq PGS on the MiSeq platform. And it will also be available on NextSeq later this year.","The NIPT market continues to grow and we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of our business in the second quarter. Verified volume and service revenue came in at record levels and additionally we received New York\u2019s state approval for average risk testing, announced technology transfer agreements with Biomnis, Genoma and the Center for Human Genetics and Diagnostics. Under these agreements, they will use the HiSeq 2500 to develop and perform NIPT. We\u2019re in discussion with more than a dozen other potential customers for similar technology transfers.","Additionally, we recently announced an agreement with Berry Genomics to co-develop an NGS system to provide a cost effective, easy to use assay for NIPT in China. This system has already been validated in the clinical setting and is in late stage review by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration.","In summary, Q2 is another remarkable quarter with strong uptake of our new sequencing platforms, coupled with rapid extensions into new markets. In particular, the progress we\u2019ve made in the clinical market validates our strategy and the utility of sequencing in healthcare. We\u2019re confident in our technology leadership and believe we will continue to deliver significant growth as we unlock the power of the genome. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc who\u2019ll provide a detailed overview for our second quarter results.","Marc Stapley","Thanks, Jay. As Jay described, the Q2 marked another exceptionally strong quarter for Illumina. Revenue grew 29% year-over-year to approximately $448 million as a result of significant uptake of our HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq instruments, record sequencing consumables and stable demand from MiSeq and HiSeq products.","Globally, demand for our products remained strong during the second quarter. Shipments in the Americas grew 19% year-over-year and Europe saw 45% increase over the same period last year. In APAC, shipments grew approximately 50% year-over-year.","Instrument revenue grew 48% this year to reach a $140 million in the second quarter due to the introduction of HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq. The demand across our sequencing portfolio continues to demonstrate that each of our products plays a key role in the sequencing ecosystem and collectively meet our diverse customers\u2019 needs.","Consumable revenue in the quarter was $247 million, an increase of 15% compared to the second quarter of 2013, primarily due to high demand for sequencing consumables which was partially offset by a decline in array consumables. Consumable revenue represented 55% of total revenues, down from 62% in the prior year period and lower than the 58% we saw in Q1, due to the strengthened sequencing instruments and maintenance contracts during the second quarter.","Sequencing consumables grew 34% over Q2 of last year, due to a larger installed base of instruments including the addition of HiSeq X Ten and NextSeq to the portfolio. HiSeq and MiSeq consumables reached record levels during the second quarter. This translated to MiSeq utilization towards the top our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000.","MiSeq pull-through continues to benefit from a large number of accounts running a full at production levels. In fact approximately a quarter of MiSeq consumables will hold it by this production level accounts most of which were clinical customers as MiSeq is now being routinely used in lab developed tests and diagnostic settings for oncology, HLA and microbiology assays. Given this trend, we continue to project MiSeq pull-through a $40,000 to $45,000 per year.","HiSeq pull-through for instrument excluding HiSeq X Ten within our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000. In the third quarter, we do expect consumable utilization to decline modestly across all platforms as a result of typical seasonality associated with the vacation season.","While it is too early to provide an estimate of NextSeq or HiSeq X pull-through. Both instruments generated healthy consumer purchases during the quarter. HiSeq X Ten consumables in particular were meaningful as customers performed validation studies and initiated their whole genome projects.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenue from verified sales grew close to 75% versus Q2 2013 to equal $57 million. This improvement was driven by ongoing growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with a larger sequencing installed base, strengthened genotyping services and growth in NIPT services which benefited from test fees as well as well as increased verified revenue.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I\u2019ll highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results which exclude legal contingencies, non-cash stock compensation expense, and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today\u2019s earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter equaled 70.9% compared to 70.4% in the first quarter, as the impact of the lower mix of consumables was more than offset by improved sequencing instrument margins. Year-over-year, gross margins expanded 140 basis points, as a result of improved instrument and services margins.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter was $70 million or 15.6% of revenue, slightly higher compared to $65 million or 15.5% of revenue in the first quarter due to increased labor and clinical trial expense.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $92 million or 20.5% of revenue, compared to $84 million or 19.9% of revenue in the previous quarter. The increase was primarily due to consulting expenses associated with our global business process program as well as additional outside services and labor expense.","Adjusted operating margins was 34.9% compared to 34.9% in the first quarter and 32.3% reported in the second quarter of last year. This were higher year-over-year due to the impact of improve gross margins and operating expense leverage.","In the second quarter, we recognized approximately $700,000 of adjusted other income. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29.8% compared to 30.7% in the second quarter of last year, which at that time included the quarterly impact of the 2013 R&D tax credit.","Non-GAAP net income was $85 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.57. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $60 million and $0.43, respectively, in the second quarter of 2013.","We reported GAAP net income of $47 million or $0.31 per diluted share in the second quarter, compared to net income of $36 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the prior period.","Current-period results include $31 million recorded in other expense net for the extinguishment of data associated with the 0.25% of 2016 convertible repurchase. As well as $5 million recorded in cost of goods to reflect the ongoing royalty on B-Chip sales associated with the Syntrix litigation including interest.","We generated cash flow from operations of $178 million during the second quarter, higher than previous quarter due to increased cash collections combined with the reduction in tax and compensation related payments. DSO decreased to 53 days compared to 63 days last quarter, as a result of both the [indiscernible] shipments and our collection efforts.","Capital expenditures were $23 million resulting in $155 million of free cash flow. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 508,000 shares for $72 million as part of our discretionary repurchase plan. And we now have $165 million remaining under our previously announced program.","Additionally we priced $1.15 billion of convertible senior notes significantly improving the majority of our debt which now comprises $320 million due in 2016, $633 million due in 2019 and $570 million due in 2021.","We repurchased $600 million aggregate principal amount of the existing 2016 convertible senior notes for a total consideration of $1.24 billion, which removed approximately $3.5 million shares from our diluted share account.","Now that the 50 million warrants associated with the cool spread on the previous 2014 debt have now been extinguished. The end of the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash in short-term investments.","Given our strong first half results and our ability to logically satisfy HiSeq X demand, we have updated our guidance for 2014. We now project revenue growth of 25% to 26% year-over-year, an increase from the previous guidance of 21% to 23% growth and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $2.26 to $2.28, higher than our prior guidance of $2.10 to $2.15.","Additional modeling considerations include full-year weighted average, non-GAAP diluted shares of $149 million, which assumes a stock price of $175 and a full year proof on the tax rate of 29% which includes the 2014 federal R&D tax credit that has yet to be enacted.","If the tax credit and other tax extenders are not passed, our annual tax rate would increase by approximately 200 basis points.","In summary, we delivered strong second quarter results and are projecting significant growth through 2014 and beyond. We continue to drive technology leadership of market expansion to become the clinical standard, enabling us to address the more than $20 billion market opportunity ahead of us.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question plus a related follow-up if necessary keeping it to two question the most. Operator, we\u2019ll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Nice quarter, guys. Just first on the population efforts with Sidra now in the press release. Can you really just talk a little bit about what the backlog looks like producing population studies and any numbers you can around the Sidra effort in terms placement?","Jay Flatley","Well, when we use the word backlog, Tycho, we actually consider backlog to be orders that are unshipped. So beyond Sidra, there\u2019s really nothing in backlog. In terms of what the prospect channel looks like of course, Genome England, we\u2019ve announced that we are the preferred provider there. We have not yet signed the agreement so until we sign that agreement we will actually have a purchase order and have that in backlog.","But beyond those two, we\u2019re working around the globe with probably 10 to 15 potential prospects and the use in that pipeline range from customers who are very really on in their thinking to ones that are much more advanced.","We suspect that it will take some number of years for these to begin to roll out in volume. But we continue to be quite optimistic about the concepts around population sequencing. And that when you look over to three to five-year window that will become a significant part of our business.","With respect to Sidra specifically, that the first purchase order was for HiSeq X Ten and some related equipment that goes along with that. The next set of questions will be the pace with which they begin to do population sequencing. And if that accelerates dramatically over the next year or so, we\u2019ll they need more instruments and we just don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about the Berry collaboration, what the thought process was there? Are you expecting this to kind of accelerate into average risk maybe faster than U.S.? How do you think about the dynamics of the market and maybe revenue impact?","Jay Flatley","We do expect it will get to average risk populations faster in China. With the birth rate in China, the market opportunity there is absolutely enormous. And as most of you probably know, the CFDA in China put a stop to routine NIPT testing. They allowed some labs to continue to do the testing in order to generate clinical information and we\u2019ve been clearly working with some of those laboratories with Berry.","They are working with us in partnership around some changes to the instrument to have it manufacturable in China, software changes, some specifics on the sample preparation to have a product that is suitable for the Chinese market that sequences at the right depth for the kind of test that\u2019s required in that Chinese market. And as we mentioned in the script, we\u2019re in late stage evaluation through the agency in China.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And if I can just ask one clarification, did the timeline in the NeoPreps slip? I think you had originally said that over the summer and no hot ball [ph].","Jay Flatley","I would say it slipped but a few months, Tycho. And that\u2019s really because we want to do very extensive testing to this product before we put it into the market. Because we\u2019re going to deploy six assays on this platform before the end of the year and the sample prep market\u2019s extraordinary important for us and we think we will place a lot of instruments quickly once we start shipping this. We want to make sure that this instrument and associated assays are extraordinarily robust. We\u2019ve added a couple of months of testing into the program timeline and so it has slipped a bit.","Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just starting with a follow-up to one of Tycho\u2019s questions. Clearly, the recent announcement with Berry Genomics highlights the fact that NextSeq was designed to clearly have a role in NIPT. As we think about the outlook for NIPT in the non-high risk market and the need for a lower price, lower cost solution, would you be willing to comment a little bit on how important a role NextSeq is supposed to have in reducing the cost and helping you even more aggressively into the lower risk market?","Jay Flatley","As I say that NextSeq is a very, very important product for us in NIPT. And probably the way to best think about this is in the environments where NIPT testing is very centralized which we think will be probably more the case in the U.S. that HiSeq will be the better option because it\u2019s very large sample flow and the cost per read is lower on a HiSeq than on a NextSeq.","However, a large share of the world\u2019s market, and particularly as we get into more average risk testing, will become more distributed. And in that case, NextSeq is absolutely the perfect product because it multiplexes at the right kind of level to deal with the more moderate sample flows that you\u2019d have in a distributed environment.","So for the broad Chinese market where they may be 3,000 hospitals that would be doing NIPT testing, NextSeq is a much better product for that environment than HiSeq even with the slightly higher cost per read because you don\u2019t have the dead time in between runs. And as the impedance matches better to the sample flow, NextSeq is the ideal product.","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. And then if I could just follow up on \u2013 I guess follow up with just a longer term outlook question. Illumina is clearly one of the few companies out there with a revenue base of over $1 billion that can still generate mid to high 20s revenue growth. You\u2019re clearly playing from a position of strength right now and you have the currency to pursue a lot of different directions. I\u2019ve made these observations six months after you named the new president who yields from the tech industry a few weeks after you acquired clinical expertise with Myraqa and in the midst of a summer where you\u2019re talking about doing more in areas such as liquid biopsy and just added Tina Nova to the team.","It just seems like there\u2019s some signs that Illumina may not be content to be just an arms dealer over the next few years. As we sit here a few weeks in advance of when you typically go into your planning and budgeting meetings for the upcoming year, it seems like a good time to ask how you\u2019re thinking about the future. I\u2019m not suggesting there is any thought that you\u2019re not going to continue to dominate your core market and drive the pace of sequencing innovation. What I\u2019m really wondering here is if you\u2019re thinking that this is the time to increasingly use your strength to move beyond just being an arms dealer and if so, how should we think about the outlook for investment and strategic developments over the next year or two?","Jay Flatley","I think that there\u2019s really been no change in our strategy here and I guess I would characterize our strategy as one that goes beyond being an arms dealer but not one that is a company that is selling clinical tests directly to physicians and running in our own laboratories other than to gather clinical data to submit products to the FDA for approval.","Our real focus and one of the key reasons that Myraqa was so important to us is that we need to begin to run a very significant number of products through the regulatory cycles inside the company, the clearance cycles, at a pace that almost no other company has ever done frankly. Particularly as we get into these PMAs, the FDA only approves two to three PMAs a year. And we\u2019re going to try to push a whole bunch of products through there in the next three years.","So we need that resource to accelerate it. And the strategy is to get these through the FDA, get them approved and then sell a bundled solution that includes the kit, the software, the instrument, the analytics, the cloud support that\u2019s necessary to implement this; in some cases, data sharing. So in our view, that\u2019s well beyond an arms dealer. It\u2019s selling a complete solution. What it\u2019s not doing, again to be clear, is taking those products directly to physicians and running the product out of our own laboratories.","Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Derik de Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, good afternoon.","Jay Flatley","Hi, Derik.","Marc Stapley","Derik.","Derik de Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","And so you said something interesting or several things interesting, but the one that I found interesting was you were talking about the move to do NGS standards in the clinic and your involvement in that. Could you talk a little bit about that? I\u2019m just curious, is this standard for everybody\u2019s platform in terms of what you need for NGS or is this more focused on Illumina? I\u2019m just curious what were the representation from the other sequencing firms and sort of how does the regulatory in a standard environment sort of flesh out.","Jay Flatley","Yes. This was a consortium we put together under sort of Rick\u2019s vision and creation. It consisted of a handful of working groups that included large cancer centers, some academic representation, some peripheral participation from the FDA, although they were not actually part of the committees themselves, and Illumina. So there were not other sequencing vendors as part of this. But what our goal was to do here was to set standards that these committees believed would meet the needs of the clinical community.","So this wasn\u2019t \u2013 the communities themselves were not driven by Illumina. We didn\u2019t share any of the committees. But the focus was all around some of the seminal questions that our customers have about how do you prepare the sample, what sample input volumes do you need, how do you handle FFPE, what\u2019s the concentration, how deep do you need to sequence, how do you analyze and report out the data, what do you do with incidental findings.","And so each of these committees has now completed their work in what we called Phase 1. And we plan to publish this information. So it\u2019s going to be available to anybody. So any other sequencing vendor could use these same standards to deliver products into the community. But we thought getting those done and getting them done quickly, which we have accomplished I think in a very short period of time, was critically important to move the market forward.","Derik de Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Great, thanks for the clarification on that. And just one question, so can we talk arrays for a moment and just give us a little bit of flavor in terms of how your array business is sort of fragmented? So give me some ideas in terms of what Cyto with that biobanking, what sort of gene you\u2019re talking, just sort of giving us a sense because if you\u2019re talking about growth of biobanking and bios and these other ones in the future DTC stuff, I just sort of want to get a flavor sort of how to better model it versed [ph] at your standpoint.","Jay Flatley","Yes, I mean we don\u2019t probably break down all the sub-categories in the array business but Infinium is clearly a big part of our array business. More and more is going toward customized chips within the Infinium product line, so our more focused array products. As a result of that, we now have a whole group that\u2019s really focused totally on creation of custom products, both sequencing and arrays because of that trend.","Ag continues to be a good market. It\u2019s growing probably mid-single digits I\u2019d say in the ad market. Most of that market is now a raise and not as much sequencing. Back couple years ago, sequencing was the new thing there because you had to sequence a bunch of these organisms initially to be able to develop the array of products. But today, it\u2019s more of an array-based market.","IVF I think is coming on strong there. It\u2019s a very young market and one that has a tremendous amount of upside opportunity, although part of that will go to sequencing as well over time.","The parts of our market that were a bit weak, as we mentioned, were in some segments of consumer. We have a couple of consumer customers who are doing extremely well. But we had one customer in particular that had lower volumes in the quarter. And as I mentioned, we, in terms of year-over-year, comparables we had a large project that wrapped up and that\u2019s helped or that caused the incenting [ph] volume to drop somewhat.","Derik de Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","I guess, and this is probably a quick follow up, how many more of the biobanking deals are out there in terms of just beside the opportunity and where everything is sort of in the negotiation? I know there have been some announcements on that. I\u2019m just curious in terms of globally what do people do with it and are people going to move more towards sequencing when they\u2019re doing the biobank characterization?","Jay Flatley","So I\u2019d say there\u2019s probably over the next few years a handful of biobank projects is probably the right way to think about it. Our expectation is that those would not move to sequencing anytime soon. And the reason is that typically almost by definition, a biobank project is a very large number of samples. And so you need extremely low price per sample. And then these projects tend to be in the $50 to $100 per sample range. And so sequencing is probably not the technology that\u2019s going to address that market segment.","Derik de Bruin \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please proceed.","Dan Arias \u2013 Citigroup","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Jay, on the X Ten, just given the way that demand and manufacturing capabilities are tracking at this point, are production and capacity something that you think will be a factor next year or do you think that at that point you kind of are able to manage through the types of shipment numbers that your pipeline sort of implies here?","Jay Flatley","Yes, I think our capacity is going to be fine at this point. We\u2019re still a bit in the catch up mode to the backlog because we booked so many right out of the shoot in the first sort of quarter and a half when this product was in the marketplace.","And as we discussed with all of our new product launches, you can\u2019t build capacity to instantly drive down that backlog or else when you get to the more steady state, your capacity is too high. So we have to keep the capacity a bit higher than the incoming order rate to be in the drive down the backlog. I suspect by the end of this year we\u2019ll be sort of at a steady state rate on HiSeq X Tens in terms of a match of incoming order rate to production volumes.","Dan Arias \u2013 Citigroup","Yes, okay. That\u2019s great. And then maybe just one on the clinical markets. I guess, how are you thinking about RNASeq and the ability to sort of move in on qPCR for gene expression assays?","Jay Flatley","RNASeq continues to be one of our most important applications. In fact, it\u2019s one of the core uses of NextSeq. It\u2019s a fantastic instrument for doing RNASeq. Some of the new sample products that we\u2019ve launched are targeted expressly at that market. And so I do think we\u2019re going to continue to eat away at PCR type applications for doing expression. And RNASeq is the perfect platform to do it. And as the price of the sample prep kits continue to come down, I think it becomes more and more competitive with PCR.","Dan Arias \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please proceed.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","Good afternoon, guys, and congrats.","Jay Flatley","Thanks, Ross.","Marc Stapley","Thanks, Ross.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","So on the X Ten customer base, if we think about like the evolution of the conversations you guys are having, I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s sort of some interesting incoming requests to sort of discuss with the new project ideas or the like. How is sort of the type of customer or the mix or geographic kind of change, I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s where like you see one country pursuing a massive endeavor of looking at hundreds of thousands or eventually multiples of that as samples, do you see other countries in the region where budgets are also like similar levels, say what we would like to sort of discuss something else? I\u2019m just trying to get the sense for like the network effect and where that\u2019s sort of had the most surprising sort of shift and where not maybe.","Jay Flatley","Let me try to answer out there and you can tell me if I\u2019ve successfully answered your question because I\u2019m not 100% sure of what you\u2019re asking here. But I guess in terms of the profile of customers so far in X Ten, we\u2019ve probably been surprised by the overall interest in Asia. That\u2019s an area that\u2019s way surpassed our expectations.","I would say what\u2019s happened in Europe is about what we expected. And there\u2019s some good continued prospects in Europe that we think will wind up being Q3 or Q4 type opportunities.","In terms of a network effect, I guess we haven\u2019t seen maybe other than a couple of examples customers feeling like they had to buy one because their competitor bought one. We\u2019ve seen maybe a few examples like that. There probably have been more purchases outside of customers who have years of experience in sequencing that we may have thought.","Our profile going in was that probably two-thirds to maybe three-quarters of the customers would be those types who already knew how to sequence and just wanted to up their production levels and reduce their cost. And we\u2019re probably more like 50-50 or maybe even less than that.","And so we have a lot of new customers to sequencing using these platforms which actually is requiring us to emphasize software more and put together some more integrated software capabilities around the X Ten for those sets of customers.","Any other observations \u2013 Marc, do you have any other observations on X Ten customer types?","Marc Stapley","No, other than I think just punctuating the point you just made around the difference in mix than what we originally expected. I mean, the diversity of customers that we have that are buying X Tens is significant. I mean there\u2019s at least one of every type of customer we might have expected and some that we didn\u2019t who were buying the system or interested in it.","Jay Flatley","Yes, and I say that if we get back to the population sequencing part of your question, there\u2019s only a couple of these that we\u2019d really put in the population sequencing category so far.","Marc Stapley","Yes.","Ross Muken \u2013 ISI Group","So as usual, Jay, you\u2019re exactly on point with my confusing question. So thank you again and congrats.","Jay Flatley","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Please proceed.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC","Hi, good afternoon. I just had a couple questions on the HiSeq. I guess the first \u2013 I don\u2019t think you mentioned the kind of where you sat in terms of the consumable range this quarter. And then just in terms of the puts and takes there, obviously you\u2019ve got the upgrade and then sample prep. And then I\u2019m just curious how the HiSeq utilization is trending with the few customers who also have an X Ten now.","Jay Flatley","And Marc\u2019s going to take \u2013","Marc Stapley","On the range \u2013 what I did say in the prepared remarks was that the HiSeq utilization was within our range of 300 to 350.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC","Okay.","Marc Stapley","A while back, we stopped giving a precise number because you do see a fluctuation quarter after quarter depending on a lot of factors, including customer buying pans [ph], large orders placed beginning, end of the quarter, that kind of thing. So, yes, it was within our range and there was nothing unusual to call out there and we continue to model that kind of utilization going forward.","And even if you think about those customers at a ball and net, kind of like Jay mentioned, some of those customers have even purchased HiSeq 2500 to fuel their non-whole genome sequencing demand. And that hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 the X Ten, I mean has not changed in our expectations on the HiSeq range at all. So that 300 to 350 is still very applicable.","Jay Flatley","Yes, I think an average that\u2019s exactly right. We do have probably a couple of customers who bought X Tens that may be using their HiSeqs a little bit less. So in those specific customer sites, the revenue from consumable, some of that\u2019s shifted to X Tens off the HiSeqs. But on average, it\u2019s not having a measurable effect on the overall consumable number.","Marc Stapley","Yes. And on sample prep, just to that one specifically, obviously NeoPrep, as Jay mentioned earlier, is a really important product for us in that area. And that\u2019s something that we would hope to fuel sample prep gains going forward as well.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC","And then just in terms of the upgrade, you said that a third who could upgrade half, is that specifically to the customers that have an upgradable HiSeq, meaning the software upgrade? And then just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the install base that doesn\u2019t have access to the terabase, have you seen them actually pursue any kind of upgrade cycle at this point in terms of new instrumentation?","Jay Flatley","Yes, the one-third statistic was of the eligible instruments. And that\u2019s probably about in a range that we would have expected. We think it will continue to go up here over the next couple of quarters.","And in the prepared remarks, I mentioned a bit about what we\u2019re seeing on upgrades that we think we are beginning to see those older customers begin to upgrade and we think the pace of that will probably continue and if anything, probably accelerate a bit into 2015. And we think that overall a great cycle could last a couple of years.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC","And you still think then the quarter \u2013 I think you said a quarter to a third of the kind of installed base that can upgrade may \u2013 at some point, is that still what you\u2019re thinking?","Jay Flatley","We\u2019ve never given a number. I think there\u2019s some analyst estimates out there but we\u2019ve never given a number on the fraction that are eligible.","Amanda Murphy \u2013 William Blair & Company, LLC","Got it. Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Please proceed.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink Swann, LLC","Thanks. For my first question, I was hoping maybe you can give more color on the magnitude of the sequential growth in NextSeq. It seems like a lot of the conversation is focused on X Ten.","Jay Flatley","Yes. Sure, yes, I mean we were really pleased with what\u2019s happening with NextSeq. I mean we\u2019ve generated a lot of market demand. We\u2019re just now beginning to come up on cycles where people will start having submitted grants and grants will start coming out of the pipeline.","So if you think about it, most of the units we\u2019ve sold to date would have been through people who didn\u2019t have to go through a grant process. And so there\u2019s probably little bit of sort pent up potential energy in the pipeline right now.","As we\u2019ve said in the prepared remarks, half of those systems are coming from commercial type customers as well. So it\u2019s a product that\u2019s really appealing in market segments like oncology that really is a different segment than the MiSeq. And early on as we have talked about we were a little concerned about the cannibalization that NextSeq would have and we haven\u2019t seen that to a lot of brand new customers to sequencing technology and a lot of commercial usage of the system.","So we\u2019re very optimistic about beginning to convert the pipeline and continuing to grow it. And the product, I have to say, is working exceptionally well in the field. I mean this is by far the highest quality product we\u2019ve ever produced in the solid-state nature of the wave this is designed and manufactured. I think it\u2019s really paying off in terms of lower warranty cause and really high end TPFs [ph] and customer hands as well as great sequencing performance.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink Swann, LLC","Got it. And then for my follow-up, Jay, I wonder if I\u2019m missing something on the consumable line. The sequential growth in consumables was the lowest it\u2019s been in five years. And I know you said that consumer customer for arrays was down sequentially. But I think that was the only sequential build that I think your genotyping comment was a year-over-year comment.","So I\u2019m curious what the plug is and I wonder if it\u2019s just the distribution of the utilization of the sequences you\u2019re installing might be a bit more bimodal than it has been in the past, if you could address that.","Jay Flatley","No, it\u2019s really the difference between sequencing and arrays here. So the sequencing year-over-year consumable growth was very strong; arrays was not. And that\u2019s really the bottom line. And so the average of those two is what give us the overall number that we quoted as being lower than what you\u2019ve seen in the past.","Dan Leonard \u2013 Leerink Swann, LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. I just want to ask a question about the comment you made earlier, 70% of system orders are from new customers. Maybe wondering if you could give us a color \u2013","Jay Flatley","[Indiscernible].","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Yes, okay, I\u2019m sorry. Well, maybe in a broader level just for the new system orders you\u2019re getting from \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the orders you\u2019re getting from new customers. Can you give us a sense of the mix for the various instrumentation platforms and maybe how that compares to your current install base?","Jay Flatley","By mix do you mean mix of new versus existing?","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Well, I\u2019m just curious like \u2013","Jay Flatley","Do you mean application?","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","\u2013 of your various instrumentation platform is what the mix looks like for the new customers, are they preferentially buying more MiSeq versus NextSeq versus HiSeq, that kind of granularity. If we think about the future run rate on the [indiscernible] those boxes will generate.","Jay Flatley","Yes, so we need to be a bit careful about how we use new here to make sure that we\u2019re all in sync. So when we said, for example 70% of MiSeq orders are from new customers, those are customers that are new to MiSeq. So they\u2019ve never had a MiSeq before, they could already have a HiSeq.","So I think given that, breaking it down the way you asked isn\u2019t probably logical. That doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, if you know what I mean.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Sure. Okay, maybe just another way to look at it would be if you can give us a sense of in the argument as you look at your funnel for sale going forward, can you give us a sense of how many of the potential orders you think you\u2019re going to get could be from totally new NGS customers?","Jay Flatley","Yes. So I would say we\u2019re probably looking in any given quarter depending on which quarter it is, somewhere between 10% and 20% of our customers are brand new to NGS.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, and last one if I could just sneak it in would be, Marc, for you on the tax rate side. It looks like the guidance there is a little bit lower. And wondering if maybe \u2013 if there\u2019s anything specific there just driving in and what your priorities are around tax rate, assuming tax rate is a topical issue across the market these days? Thank you.","Marc Stapley","Yes, I think nothing\u2019s really changed around our strategy for the tax rate in particular. We\u2019ve been moving consumable manufacturing to Singapore. Arrays is largely there. We did a little bit of the change in bringing the HiSeq X consumable back to or into San Diego initially. But we did put an instrument, NextSeq, in Singapore.","So no real change there in our manufacturing location strategy. The tax rate drop that you\u2019ve seen is largely other factors I would say, including things like compensation expense and so on that are higher than we expected.","So that\u2019s really I think the key there. In terms of other strategies and what\u2019s fashionable right now and things like the inversion activities going on, I mean that\u2019s something that the way we think about that is, that would be a secondary benefit, if anything, to more strategic play we would make. And that\u2019s a completely different question.","We\u2019d have to look for the business strategy fit before anything else. And if the tax benefit with that, that would be great. But as we said before, those kinds of large opportunities we don\u2019t see many of those existing out there.","Isaac Ro \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie. Please proceed.","Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Equities Research","Thanks. Just two questions from me. I guess first Jay, I think you gave a number of $90 million in the quarter for sales going to I think [indiscernible] finding cancer customers. I just wanted to get a little bit more of a sense of what you were including in that.","Jay Flatley","That\u2019s all oncology. So it\u2019s research, translational and clinical.","And the reason we do it that way, Jon, we\u2019ve tried to break it down other ways but so many of our customers are in these hybrid situations where you \u2013 sometimes they\u2019re doing research and sometimes they\u2019re doing more translational clinical work just on HiSeqs. And so it\u2019s very difficult for us to get a clear breakdown of who\u2019s in which bucket.","Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Equities Research","Okay. And just out of curiosity for my second question here, did you give \u2013 did I miss, did you give a growth rate on kind of how that \u2013 what that grew on a year-over-year basis, cancer?","Jay Flatley","We didn\u2019t give a growth rate for that. I\u2019m sorry, we gave a shipments growth rate of 30%. That\u2019s right, shipments we did, 30%.","Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Equities Research","30%, okay, thanks. And then just I guess my second question, Jay, for you strategically as you think about sequencing and arrays, obviously your focus has been much more on sequencing. It\u2019s been a higher growth business, more investment there. One of your bigger competitors is actually starting to show some signs of life after being indebted for quite a while on that side.","I mean has your willingness to compete on that side of the business changed at all? And as your kind of view of how quickly some of those applications could move to sequencing, has that changed at all? I\u2019m just curious kind of strategically how you\u2019re thinking about your businesses there. Thanks.","Jay Flatley","Yes. Well, I would say in the past few years our R&D investments have been biased more towards sequencing. And we plan to remain extremely competitive in the array market. And if anything, you might see us shift a little bit more investment back toward arrays, both commercially and in R&D.","It continues to be a very big business for us with great gross margins. And so we continue to look on it as being very complementary to sequencing. Many applications we think will continue to move over to sequencing but those tend to be much more on the expression side than on the genotyping side.","The genotyping array market today is pretty much a low cost per sample market. And whether you\u2019re in Ag or whether you\u2019re in consumer, you\u2019re talking about per sample cost in the $50 to $150 range. And so it\u2019s going to be a while before sequencing becomes applicable to those markets.","But expression is quite different because the quality of the data you get from sequencing is so vastly enriched from what you get from an array and expression. And so those are applications that we\u2019re continuing to move over from arrays to sequencing.","Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Equities Research","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","William Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First off, Jay, can you comment about the recently increasing redirects in the FDA as well as a couple of senators around LDTs and obviously the potential for increased regulation here?","And I\u2019m guessing that this may be part of the move to expand the regulatory team. But certainly, we\u2019d love your thoughts you\u2019re giving at this markets obviously becoming pretty important to Illumina and certainly would expect it to become more so in coming years.","Jay Flatley","Yes. It seems like at least from what I\u2019ve read that most of the redirect is coming from around the FDA, not from the FDA themselves here. And there are various camps that are asking for more progress on this issue.","As you know, the question of how LDT is going to be regulated has been out there for several years at least. And so we don\u2019t have a particular crystal ball on this other than to reiterate the position that we\u2019ve taken before where we said, we think it\u2019s unlikely that there will be global requirements for all the LDTs to become FDA-approved. And that\u2019s driven by the shared number of tests. I mean even if those were all submitted, the FDA would take years and years to be able to analyze and approve those tests and the fact that so many of them are critically important to the healthcare system.","And so we do think that if regulation of LDTs does come down, it would more likely be targeted for very high risk test or some subset of tests. It could also potentially require future tests to be regulated by grandfathering in existing tests. So those are some of the options that are on the table.","And we don\u2019t know where the FDA is going to wind up on it. But clearly, we\u2019re prepared to do whatever is necessary here. And we have particularly now with our acquisition and Maya [ph] joining us, the regulatory horsepower to put things through the FDA, we think in a way and at a rate that most others don\u2019t particularly around sequencing technology.","William Quirk \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities. Please proceed.","Zarak Khurshid \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Jay, first a question on the research side of business, how much of the NIH budget do you think you account for today and where do you that\u2019s going over time?","Jay Flatley","Well, the percentage in total, we\u2019re still very small from the overall budget. I mean if you look at a breakdown of it, a massive amount of it goes to bricks and mortar and labor and the amount that goes to extramural grants and then the fraction of those extramural grants that come to sequencing, still a very small percentage.","Zarak Khurshid \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Got it, okay. And then just as a follow up on NIPT, which we love so much, how are you thinking about the pricing in the average risk setting in China just thinking about kind of the margins for those 3,000 labs? And I know the pricing environment is kind of tricky there. How do you think about the economics for those customers? Thanks.","Jay Flatley","Yes. I mean clearly the pricing is going to be lower in China to begin with and lower yet for average risk. It\u2019s probably likely in China that there will not be as much bifurcation of testing as you\u2019re beginning to see in the U.S. where there\u2019s sort of higher \u2013 test for higher risk patients being at higher price point in being a test that\u2019s got a higher quality standard perhaps than an average risk test does.","So I think in the U.S., you\u2019re going to see some bifurcation, perhaps in Europe as well. In China, it\u2019s likely to be one standardized test. The price points will be lower than what we see anywhere else in the globe, probably in the range of $300.","Even at that, we think on the NextSeq platform, our margins are going to be just fine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed.","Peter Lawson \u2013 Mizuho Securities","Jay, I wonder if you could [indiscernible] NGS diagnostic pipeline and what timelines you have of FDA submission on new tests and translate this [indiscernible] coming. Thank you.","Jay Flatley","Yes. So in NIPT in particular, we\u2019ve talked about the fact that we\u2019re submitting our verified test to the FDA and we remain on track to have that submission before year-end. We have a whole series of other projects, some around Companion Diagnostics. We\u2019ve announced one of them in June that we\u2019re working on to submit through the FDA. The result of our work on the onco panels and the actionable genome program will result in products that will need to go through the FDA as well. And we\u2019re in discussions with quite a number of sequencing partners who want to put their technology through the FDA in partnership with us.","And so when you start adding all that up, it\u2019s a lot of work and it requires a bigger team than the team we had and hence the acquisition and investments were making the regulatory.","Peter Lawson \u2013 Mizuho Securities","And then just on the array business, what parts of that do you think it exist in the three year\u2019s time?","Jay Flatley","I think the consumer part will certainly exist. The Ag part will continue to exist I suspect what we traditionally think of this whole genome association will likely not exist in three years. So that part will be gone. I think most of the expression part of the array business will have moved to sequencing in that timeframe.","I think some of the prenatal and IVF applications will move away from arrays to sequencing as well with fundamentally with better technology. But it\u2019s the low cost, high volume markets that will continue to stay on arrays, Ag, consumer being probably [indiscernible].","Rebecca Chambers","Operator, we\u2019re ready for our last question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier, Maxim Group. Please proceed.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Beyond NIPT, how does the clinical market adoption of NGS in Europe, China and other regions compare to that of the United States?","Jay Flatley","I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably fastest in the U.S. outside of NIPT. The Chinese market will come along quite quickly in other areas as well particularly in oncology, we\u2019re beginning to work very directly in that marketplace with some of the thought leaders around oncology.","I do think markets like Japan will begin to come on quickly as more oncology products come into the market. Whereas, there are laggards in some of the reproductive health markets for structural reasons and societal reasons.","I think Europe will come along generally slower than most, although, you can get CE mark on these products perhaps earlier because of the way the lab systems work in Europe. It\u2019s a much more distributed market and therefore adoption in general tends to be somewhat slower.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","Okay, thanks. And then also in terms of APAC, you\u2019ve talked about \u2013 I mean you put an extremely strong order growth this quarter and with the last three quarters, you\u2019ve discussed it as real being driven by the growth in Japan. You haven\u2019t really talked too much about China. I was wondering if you could share your thoughts around what you\u2019re seeing in China and how that\u2019s \u2013 if you saw any change late in the quarter from what you saw the last couple of quarters.","Jay Flatley","Yes, we actually have seen somewhat of a change there. So our China business was actually quite strong in the quarter. In fact, it led sort of the over performance in Asia was led by China this quarter.","Japan was actually somewhat soft and we do generally see that in Q2 because Q1 is such a strong quarter. Because of the end of the funding cycle in Japan, there\u2019s always a downturn in the second quarter. But this year in particular, there\u2019s restructuring going on inside of Japan and their equation of essentially the equivalent of the NIH there which has caused sort of structural disruption and the fund slow that we think will last a couple of quarters. So our Japan business is a bit softer. We think it would probably be a little bit softer next quarter.","But these are funds that are going to continue to flow as we get to Q4 and Q1 next year. So in some ways, it\u2019s just pushed out some of the business in Japan temporarily.","Bryan Brokmeier \u2013 Maxim Group","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","There are no further questions in queue.","Rebecca Chambers","Thank you, operator","As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the investor section of our website as well as through the dial-in instructions contained in today\u2019s earnings release.

Flatley","Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Q2 was another exceptional quarter for the company. Our business demonstrated strong underlying trends in every geography in nearly all product lines. As a result, Q2 revenue grew 23% year-over-year to $346 million, our 7th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Total microarray revenue increased 3% year-over-year, due primarily to the impact of BlueGnome. Demand for arrays remain stable as the market trends toward large sample numbers with moderate content at a lower ASP per sample. In fact, Q2 is the third quarter in a row with Infinium orders exceeding 1 million samples due to demand for our Infinium, OmniExpressExome, Core Exome and Omni2.5 products. We will begin shipping a new custom onco array in the second half of this year to early access consortium members interested in understanding the genetic basis of cancer. The onco array is the next generation of the groundbreaking iCOGS custom array that was used by the collaborative oncological gene environment study to identify genetic variants related to breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. The onco array contains approximately 600,000 markers for use in a meta analysis of over 400,000 samples. We plan to offer this array to non-consortium customers in 2014.","The consumer market continues to show a significant elasticity below the $100 price point, generating strong demand for gene mapping services and our iSelect custom arrays. For the second quarter in a row we received a large consumer order, deliverable over several years and we continue to project close to $50 million of consumer-related revenue in 2013.","Turning now to our sequencing business, total sequencing revenue grew 33% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for consumables and HiSeq instruments. During the second quarter, sequencing consumables grew 26% over Q2 of last year as a result of our larger HiSeq and MiSeq installed base, as well as growth in our Sample Prep business.","Q2 Sample Prep shipments grew close to 50% year-over-year, with strength in both the Nextera and TruSeq product lines. While Sample Prep is a competitive field, our broad portfolio of supported applications and sample types has allowed us to gain market share as we launch new offerings in our installed base growth.","Two of our newest products, the TruSeq Targeted RNA kit and our Nextera Rapid Capture Exome are seeing significant early interest. Our focus on Sample Prep has resulted in a portfolio of products with improved ease-of-use and a more complete user experience. One of our core strategies is to provide customers with the complete capability to go from biological sample to answer, quickly and easily, minimizing the risk of errors and reducing hands-on time. To that end, we recently announced collaborations with leading vendors of robotic platforms to provide automation solutions for customers requiring high throughput Sample Prep.","A few weeks ago, we completed the acquisition of Advanced Liquid Logic or ALL. This acquisition will allow us to develop an automated and integrated solution for our low to mid throughput customers. A spinoff from Duke University, the company possesses foundational liquid handling IP, including approximately 100 issued or licensed patents and approximately 200 pending applications.","ALL has developed a proprietary digital microfluidics technology, which enables the precise manipulation of small droplets within a sealed cartridge, eliminating the pumps, valves and tubes often associated with automated liquid handling. We believe this proven technology will enable us to deliver the simplest and most efficient sample-to-answer workflow, particularly for customers in the clinical and applied markets where these features are especially valued. I encourage you to visit ALL's website to see a video illustrating this exciting technology.","As you know, part of our workflow strategy includes BaseSpace, an integrated cloud ecosystem. In Q2, we announced exciting new e-commerce functionality which provides software developers the infrastructure to charge for use of their applications. Customers now have access to tools, which will simplify data analysis, while providing a new and largely untapped opportunity for software developers. Several new applications are now available for purchase in the BaseSpace App Store and we expect more to launch in the coming quarters.","Turning now to sequencing instruments, Q2 sequencing instrument revenue grew 37% compared to the second quarter of 2012, as a result of a strong demand for HiSeq instruments and 2,500 upgrades. The demand for HiSeqs was generated almost equally from existing capacity-constrained customers and customers new to the platform. This quarter, more than 75% of HiSeq orders were for the 2500 family, reinforcing the tremendous value of rapid run mode. The importance of the rapid run technology was recently demonstrated by Stephen Kingsmore and his associates at Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City. Using rapid run in a research and development configuration and a modified version of our aligner and variant calling software, they were able to prepare full genome sequence and correctly call potential disease-causing variants from a blinded quantified DNA sample in under 24 hours.","Translational, commercial and hospital customers are placing great value on the inherent flexibility of the 2500 platform. Close to 45% of HiSeq orders were from customers using the technology in the clinical development or commercial setting. This demand has also driven HiSeq 2500 upgrades. We have now completed more than 85% of the upgrades that have been ordered and expect a few remaining to be completed in the third quarter.","Customer satisfaction with HiSeq 2500 instruments and upgrades continues to be high. Later in the second half, we will deliver additional value to customers with the launch of reagents, enabling sequencing runs of up to 300G in approximately 60 hours. Additionally, our development efforts on long read, phasing and ordered array technologies are progressing well, and we'll continue to deliver dramatic performance enhancements to our SBS chemistry.","We will also introduce MiSeq functionality in the third quarter, which will enable throughput of approximately 15G per run. Interest in this product enhancement is high as customers look forward to continually improving instrument performance.","Our competitive position in the bench top sequencing market remains strong as evidenced by stable ASPs despite the successful conclusion of our 15 for 15 program, which offered a discount on the instrument when bundled with the purchase of 15 consumable kits and competitor price concessions. As a result, in the second quarter, we again won more than 80% of head-to-head placements.","We continue to see strong MiSeq adoption from translational and clinical customers, including customers switching from capillary systems. Again this quarter, more than 50% of MiSeqs were ordered by nonacademic customers including a multiunit order from HistoGenetics, a leader in HLA testing services. HistoGenetics selected the MiSeq platform as it has the simplest workflow, as well as the highest quality data output for implementation into their clear production facility. HLA typing is performed on more than 1 million samples annually worldwide and we're actively engaged with the community to demonstrate the benefits of next-generation sequencing to this important application.","Recently, the MiSeqDx Cystic Fibrosis System, which includes the MiSeqDx instrument, our CF carrier screening assay and CF diagnostic assay, became the first NexGen system to have the CE Mark applied. Our carrier screening assay detects 162 functionally-verified, clinically relevant variance within the CFTR gene, the largest variant panel available today. Our diagnostic assay has been shown to have superior performance in challenging regions of the gene, including homopolymers, as well as large deletions and mutations. Both of these assays run with low sample input and can be completed in less than 2 days.","Moving to FastTrack Services. In the second quarter, we shipped approximately 2,500 genomes compared to 750 genomes in the prior year period. While genomes shipped were lower sequentially, due primarily to the timing of project completions, we received more than 6,000 orders for whole genome sequencing services in the second quarter, a new record. We expect to process these orders over the coming quarters as the samples are received. Included in this number is the initial award with the VA Million Veteran Program, where we will be working with Personalis to sequencing genotype more than 1,000 veterans and 1,000 genomes for Inova, a not-for-profit health care system based in Northern Virginia.","Recently, we launched our Phasing Analysis Service based on the Moleculo technology. This is the first commercial service available for customers wanting to phase human genomes. Early access customers have provided positive feedback and study designs have demonstrated the diverse range of applications supported by this service. In the coming quarters, we'll also launch kits for generating synthetic long reads and phasing of human data.","The integration of Verinata continues to progress well, and we're pleased to announce that reimbursement coverage for the verifi test has been significantly enhanced in the second quarter. Today, coverage for the verifi prenatal test is expanded to approximately 170 million covered lives in the United States, plus with the agreement with Teva Pharmaceutical's 25,000 lives in Israel. Part of this expanded coverage was a result of Verinata entering into a national agreement with Blue Cross and Blue Shield to offer independent plans access to competitive pricing for the verifi prenatal test. Importantly, contracted lives, a more important metric, as it reflects contract decisions for specific tests, have also grown significantly. We recently received contracting decisions from United Healthcare and Aetna, as well as multiple other payers. Today, more than 60 million covered lives are contracted for the verifi test.","As you will recall, a key goal of the acquisition of Verinata was to enable the overall growth of the NIPT market. The 2 main prongs of this strategy are to license Verinata's intellectual property and once we've completed the necessary data, to submit the verifi test for regulatory approvals. We believe an IVD test will significantly expand the global market and enable all test providers to be successful in this field.","During the second quarter, we began dialogue with the FDA on the trial design necessary for an NIPT submission. While a clinical trial to support a PMA application is a multi-year process, we are pleased with our early FDA interactions and with our progress today.","With respect to our existing customers in the NIPT market, we are broadly engaged in discussions but have nothing specific to report to you today.","Overall, I'm extremely pleased with our Q2 and first half results. In the second quarter, we grew revenue year-over-year and sequentially following a strong Q1. Orders exceeded our internal plan and we made significant progress on many of our strategies for continued technology leadership and long-term growth. Each quarter, we're diversifying our revenue base by engaging with customers who were using nexgen sequencing for new applications, making it easier, more efficient and more economical for them to access this empowering technology. We remain dedicated to improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome and continue to believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the enormous potential of the sequencing market.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc who will provide a detailed overview of our second quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley","Thanks, Jay. As Jay mentioned, this was another exceptional quarter for Illumina, and I'm pleased to report our operational and financial results, which includes second quarter revenue of $346 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year. Organic revenue grew 19% year-over-year as a result of continued strength in HiSeq instruments and growth in sequencing consumables. These results were based on strong global demand for our products.","In Q2, revenue in the Americas grew 22% year-over-year, and European revenue increased 19% over the same period. In APAC, revenue grew 36% year-over-year due primarily to continued strength in Japan. Importantly, our revenue base is becoming ever more diverse, which has lessened to an extent our exposure to fluctuations in funding. Historically, approximately 80% of shipments were attributed to academic and government customers. Last year, we saw a strong demand from non-traditional customers, which led to approximately 30% of shipments coming from clinical, agricultural, commercial, hospital and translational customers. We have made great progress in further diversifying our revenue stream in the first half of 2013 as approximately 40% of our shipments were to customers in these applied markets.","Instrument revenue for the second quarter was $95 million, an increase of 31% compared to the second quarter of 2012 due to upgrade revenue of significant year-over-year growth in HiSeq instruments.","MiSeq unit shipments were slightly higher than last year's elevated level, which benefited from backlog clearing associated with the first few quarters in MiSeq placements. MiSeq orders grew sequentially, as well as year-over-year, with notable strength in APAC.","Consumable revenue in the quarter was $215 million, an increase of 17% compared to the second quarter of 2012, primarily due to our growing installed base, higher demand for Sample Prep and sequencing consumables and BlueGnome. Consumable revenue represented 62% of total revenue, flat compared to Q1 and a decrease from 65% in the prior year period, primarily due to the strength seen this quarter in HiSeq instruments.","In Q2, annual HiSeq pullthrough per instrument was in our projected range of 300k to 350k, and up sequentially due to the increased customer utilization of core sequencing consumables and Sample Prep reagent. We do expect HiSeq utilization to decline modestly in the third quarter, while staying well within our guided range as a result of typical seasonality associated with the vacation season. With more than 60% of MiSeq placements going to new customers in the first half of 2013, MiSeq utilization per instrument was immaterially below our annual projected pullthrough range of 45k to 50k.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenue from Verinata, grew 50% versus Q2 2012 to equal $33 million. This improvement was driven by an increase in genomes processed year-over-year, the ongoing growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with an increasing sequencing installed base and revenue from Verinata.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude legal contingency, noncash stock compensation expense, expenses related to Roche's unsolicited tender offer and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the second quarter was 69.5% as compared to 70.9% in the second quarter of 2012. The year-over-year decline in margin was attributable to the impact of acquisitions and the lower mix of consumables. Gross margins expanded 30 basis points sequentially due to sales of higher margin instruments and operational efficiencies.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $59 million or 17% of revenue compared to $53 million or 16% of revenue in the first quarter. The sequential increase in R&D expense was primarily due to the full-quarter impact of Verinata, as well as headcount additions and outside services to support our robust pipeline of products in development.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $70 million or 20.3% of revenue compared to $66 million or 19.9% of revenue in the previous quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to a full quarter of Verinata, additional headcount to support our planned commercial growth and our project focused on improving global business processes.","Adjusted operating margins were 32.3% compared to 33.3% in the first quarter, primarily due to the impact of a full quarter of Verinata and increased headcount. Compared to the 36.7% we reported in the second quarter of last year, adjusted operating margins were lower due to the impact of acquisition and lower gross margins, as well as the increased investment in both R&D and SG&A to support our long term growth.","In the second quarter, we recognized approximately $1 million of adjusted other expense due to volatility in foreign exchange rates and lower interest income. Going forward, assuming no material fluctuation in foreign exchange rates, we expect the other expense line to be close to 0 as a result of a lower cash balance post the warrant retirement and ALL acquisition.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 30.7% compared to 33.8% in the second quarter of last year. Non-GAAP net income was $60 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.43. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $53 million and $0.40, respectively, in the second quarter of 2012.","We reported GAAP net income of $36 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the second quarter compared to $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the prior year period. Current period results include the charge of $16 million for the litigation associated with the Syntrix verdict, $7 million of which was recorded in cost of goods to reflect the ongoing royalty associated with BeadChip sales plus associated interest, and $9 million of which was recorded in operating expenses to reflect the updated judgment which was primarily related to interest. Our post trial motions are proceeding in this case and we expect an update later this year. Ongoing expenses related to Roche's unsolicited tender offer were $5 million, and such charges are expected to end in the third quarter.","We generated cash flow from operations of $89 million during the second quarter, capital expenditures were approximately $12 million, resulting in $77 million of free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.13 billion in cash and short-term investments. And post the close of the quarter, we completed the purchase of ALL for up to $96 million, which will be reflected in our ending third quarter cash balance. Q2 inventory was $168 million, which is flat compared to the first quarter despite sequential revenue growth. DSO decreased to 55 days compared to 58 days last quarter as a result of improved linearity and gains from process improvements made over the last few quarters.","During the quarter, approximately 397,000 shares were repurchased for $25 million which completed our 10b5-1 buyback authorization. We continue to have $118 million remaining under our previously announced discretionary repurchase program. And following the close of the quarter, we retired approximately 3 million warrants associated with the 2014 convertible debt cost spread for $125 million in an effort to offset ongoing regular dilution from our employee stock plans. Approximately 15 million warrants remain outstanding, which expire ratably between May and July of next year. The impact of these warrants has been included in our diluted share count at an amount related to our stock price since the issuance of the 2014 convertible bond.","As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with our operational and financial performance for the first half of 2013. Given our strong results, we are raising both our revenue and earnings per share guidance. For 2013, we are now projecting total company revenue growth of approximately 20%, an increase from the previous guidance of 15% growth and full year non-GAAP EPS of $1.68 to $1.72, higher than our prior guidance of $1.55 to $1.62. These projections include the impact of both the Verinata and ALL acquisitions, as well as ongoing investment to support our long-term growth. Assumptions embedded in this guidance include full year gross margin of 69.5%, stock compensation expense of $105 million and the full-year pro forma tax rate of 30%.","Lastly, at the current stock price, full-year weighted diluted shares outstanding are expected to be $138 million. This projection includes the impact of the retired warrants.","In summary, we're very pleased with the rhythm of our business and our strong first half results. We continue to be diligently focused on exemplary execution of our business strategies.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question plus a related follow-up if necessary. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, just on the ALL deal. Can you talk about the average number of collaborations with Jmark [ph] Illumina and others? Can you maybe just talk about how you foresee those playing out going forward? And then also the up to $96 million, what does that assume for kind of milestones and other things going forward?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, we are intending clearly, Tycho, to honor the obligations we have under the existing ALL agreements and those give to those third parties particular rights to the technology in specific market segments. None of those agreements, we think, preclude Illumina from doing exactly what is our goal with respect to the technology, which is very directly focused into the sequencing marketplace overall. In terms of the purchase price, it's a combination of an upfront and milestones. We're not, at this point, disclosing what those milestones are, what the amounts are.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick follow up on diagnostic pricing. Can you talk about whether -- as your customers are commercializing tests, whether you're able to extract the better pricing? I guess, we've heard a little bit from the field about putting on supplementary pricing for some of the customers commercializing diagnostic tests? I'm just wondering if you can...","Jay T. Flatley","We are, and largely that comes through the what we call our TCG reagents channel. And as we began to get into the diagnostics market a few years ago, what we heard very clearly from those customers was that they required more in our reagent kits than we typically provided. That has to do with more extensive lot tracking, longer shelf life, the ability for us to continue to manufacture what would otherwise be obsolete products in the RUO space. As we layered these obligations that are appropriately demanded from us by those diagnostic customers, it clearly increases our costs of producing and holding those reagents. As a result of that, anybody who's using the TCG reagents pays a premium price to access those reagent sets and they get essentially premium capability and services associated with those kits.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Co.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","First question is during the quarter, you announced the CE Mark for a CF platform, a partnership with HistoGenetics in HLA testing and also plans to launch an HAI kit with pathogenic, 3 areas where multiplex tools have had a prominent role. Can you just walk us through why these areas? Are there more to come and do you have plans to work through the FDA process in some of these areas, especially CF where you did pursue the CE Mark in Europe?","Jay T. Flatley","We're looking to partner very broadly, Doug, across lots of areas of diagnostics. HLA is a very large market opportunity and we're engaged with multiple customers who want to use NexGen sequencing into that market. HistoGenetics was the first of potentially several that we might work with in that marketplace. You will see us continue to attempt to do this in many other areas, including infectious disease and cancer where we have lots and lots of different customers using the technology platform. So I think the partnering strategy there is working very well. What we will put through the FDA will be highly selective, and those are particular applications where we think having an IVD kit makes sense to be able to sell very broadly into labs around the globe. There may be cases where there's intellectual property in the partner we're working with that prevents us from doing that unless we specifically partner with that entity to put the product through the FDA jointly. In the case specifically of CF, we were able to do that on our own and we're now selling it in Europe under CE Mark broadly. And once we get it approved through the FDA in the U.S., we will sell it to all the labs broadly as an FDA-approved products here.","Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then really, I guess, an expense question. Q2 was your first full quarter with Verinata as part of the company. R&D spending increased, I believe, it was $6.4 million sequentially. Is most of that Verinata and is this a good R&D run rate as we think about how to model the second half? And, I guess, more broadly, 2013 was positioned as a year where you were going to aggressively expand your commercial footprint. How is that effort progressing and how should we think about spend accordingly as we move into the second half?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I guess, I would say a material part of the increase in expenses was due to the incremental remaining part of the quarter of Verinata expenses. But you should expect through Q3 and Q4 a continued increase in R&D and SG&A spending. Obviously those spending increases will be, should I say, modulated appropriately. And so they're not going to be huge increases, but we're adding headcount in both areas, in R&D particularly, because we have a rich portfolio of products that we continue to work across and lots of demand for resources there. In the commercial side of the business, we're making great progress in adding sales people into the team, as well as new additions in marketing. Most of the impact of that on the revenue side will be seen toward the end of the year because as we add new sales people, it typically takes 3 to 6 months for them to fully come up to speed. But we're progressing well on the headcount additions in SG&A.","Marc A. Stapley","And, Doug, it's Marc. Just to be clear, I mean, the increase in expenses that Jay is referencing is implied in the updated guidance that we provided.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the new 15G run for MiSeq, could you talk about a little bit of the technology that you got there? What's the cycle time improved to and where you are in the read lengths?","Jay T. Flatley","The improvements are largely due to new versions of chemistries, so we call it V3 chemistry. It increases the number of reads as well as the overall read length. The read length is [indiscernible] by 300. So we have great performance across read lengths. We also are increasing the number of tags to allow us to do more exome sequencing on that platform as we get the V3 kits into the marketplace.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So it's still running the same 5 minute cycle times? So a 15G run, then, is how long to take?","Christian O. Henry","Cycle times, I believe, are going to speed up some.","Jay T. Flatley","I don't have that number right off the top of my head, Derik, but we have shrunk the cycle time down. Every time we try to extend read length, we try to shrink cycle time at the same time. And we were successful. I just don't know the exact number. I can follow-up with you after.","Christian O. Henry","But the full run on a MiSeq with pair 300s will be approximately 60 hours.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to switch on another -- on technology -- another one, just could you talk about just the whole-genome sequencing market and where ASPs are on that and some commentary on volume? And also, just to follow through on that, where are you with your BGI contract?","Jay T. Flatley","Whole-genome sequencing, I guess, I'd say we continue to see migration of customers toward whole-genome sequencing away from exome and targeting to some extent, although exomes are continuing. HiSeq is clearly a fantastic platform for running exomes because you can multiplex them so highly and do it so inexpensively. As I said in the script, we had a record order received number for whole genomes in services, so we're continuing to see good progress there. Although that service ordering tends to be irregular in terms of both the pattern of orders, because they're large, and also in terms of delivery because we record the revenue when we complete the project and in some cases, when the customer actually accepts the data under some contracts. So great continued trends in whole-genome sequencing. As we continue to make improvements in technology, we're going to continue to make progress in the ability to do that ever more cheaply for our customers. With respect to BGI, we've completed an RUO agreement with BGI, and so that's been in place for some time, a month or 2. We are still working on a clinical agreement with them that's incomplete at the moment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you give us maybe on Verinata, a little bit of color on kind of what the volume ramp has looked like? Obviously, we've seen what the key player in that market's done but just to kind of get a sense for obviously, it's been exponential growth as an industry overall. Trying to get a sense for how you feel like you're sharing -- faring from a share perspective and how you're expecting that to accelerate in the second half with kind of the efforts of your partner?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I mean, I guess, we're going to be cautious about disclosing volumes on Verinata, particularly because, as you know, we play broadly in this market and we supply to all of the major companies that are providing technology into this space. We are doing well, as I mentioned. We think both our covered lives and contracted lives numbers are progressing quite nicely, so we're doing very, very well there. We've continued to improve the technology that's being used by Verinata. We've put more sequencers in there automating the Sample Prep around the technology to be able to handle higher sample volumes. I think the reimbursement rates have exceeded our expectation, probably, in terms of where those numbers are coming in. So really, pretty positive trends across the board there.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And maybe talk a bit about what Christian's been doing on the BD side, I mean ALL, really interesting little asset. It seems like you guys are being a lot more active, trying to fill-in all the various areas around the existing portfolio with sort of exciting new technologies. Maybe talk a bit about what the pipeline looks like? What areas, maybe not giving away specific targets, but just generally big picture areas that kind of get you the most excited and where you see kind of the best kind of emerging technologies maybe developing on the forefront?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, we have been quite active in M&A and I think you'll continue to see us do some of these tuck-in type of acquisitions, fewer of the moderate to large ones and some continued rate of these relatively small ones. We are looking at technology pieces that accelerate the development of our future platforms, obviously our platform plans go out 3 to 5 years, and we have really great expectations about where the technology is going to head and how we'll be able to improve overall system integration, reducing hands-on time, making this more foolproof so that sequencing can become ever more prevalent in the clinic and used by less and less sophisticated users. So you can imagine, if you think about the entire workflow of sequencing from the earliest parts of the Sample Prep, all the way through informatics, we're looking to fill in any bits and pieces along that pipeline that we don't currently have. Some of that clearly is being done internally through our own research and development efforts but if we have the opportunity to go get it quickly outside at a reasonable price, we will do that.","Christian O. Henry","And I also think, Jay, we should recognize our corp dev group, Nick Naclerio. The ALL transaction was complicated in the sense that there were a lot of different relationships to work through and they stuck with it and it's going to be a real fantastic asset for us. I'm really excited about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So I had a question on the ordered arrays. I'm curious, from our discussions, it seems like your customers are pretty excited about that in terms of what it might do for throughput. So curious if you can provide a perspective on timing and how to think about what throughput improvements there might be relative to sort of overall demand for capacity at this point in the sequencing phase?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I think we're on-track, Amanda, to hit the targets that we set out earlier in the year, and that's to have the first ordered arrays in the hands of our customers before year-end in an early access mode. We think they'll probably become commercial in the very earliest part of 2014. We will deploy ordered arrays selectively in particular kits, where those applications demand high throughput. So not every one of our kits is going to get ordered arrays. Maybe ultimately, they will all move in that direction, but in the near term, we're picking off the most important application areas and applications in general in terms of read length and reads, both that need the ordered array technology. The performance improvements you'll get from ordered arrays will depend on the architecture you deploy it on. In almost all cases, we will get the advantage of more reads, but in our lower resolution optical systems, the density you'll be able to put down, lay down in terms of ordered arrays will be more limited than in the higher resolution systems, which obviously, is the HiSeq at the very high end. So HiSeq will get the greatest advantage, MiSeq will get a lesser advantage.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then just I guess, I don't know if you've talked about pricing for ordered arrays yet, or maybe you could provide something there, if you're giving that data? And then also just generally, how you're thinking about pricing for HiSeq consumables, I guess, generally sequencing consumables going forward?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We have not disclosed any pricing on ordered arrays yet. In fact, we haven't even had our pricing committee meeting. So we don't actually know what the prices are and we're waiting to see what the final performance looks like off these arrays before we go into sort of the pricing phase, which will happen here in the back half of 2013. I'm sorry, the second part of your question, was what...","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I guess, [indiscernible] thinking about you've had a few price increases on the consumable for sequencing, is that something you plan on continuing?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I think in general, our intention is to have moderate price increases in consumable kits on an annualized basis. And then we will deliver significant changes in value to customers when we have technology shifts, either in major changes in the kits or modifications in the platforms. And so I think if you think about what the pricing curve looks like, it will probably be one that will have some plateaus in it and then there will be some significant drops and then another plateau and then additional drops. And so it may not be sort of monotonically decreasing, it may be more digital, the way you might think about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jay, you mentioned the work that the Mercy General folks are doing in pediatrics, which when they talked about it, sounded like a pretty excellent application. But it also seems fairly cutting-edge. So, I guess, how quickly do you think we'd see an acceleration in that type of quick turnaround work in the hospital setting?","Jay T. Flatley","I think the 2500 is a great example of how important these rapid turnaround capabilities are and what we talked about in the script, I think is really exemplary of what customers think about the ability to both manage their Qs on the one hand but also in clinical applications, get data back to the treating physician. We're working with lots and lots of groups now where they really want to get answers quite quickly, and it's very important in areas like infectious disease, transplants in HLA, less important perhaps in cancers, at least in the bulk of the cancer market where treatment decisions usually take a couple of weeks, and you have a little bit more leeway. But in almost every case, the patient wants to know as quickly as possible. And so whether you're doing an NIPT test or even in the cancer example, turnaround time matters. And so I think the technology we use with Stephen Kingsmore is largely technology we have today. So it's really just a packaging up. There's no brand new invention required to get to that sub 24-hour turnaround. It really has to do with sort of packaging up sample to answer sort of complete workflow in deploying that fully commercially to get it. There's really no breakthroughs required now.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up on the whole-genome question, can you talk a little bit about the IGN genomes that you are shipping, what kind of customers are those going to and I guess, what kind of an appetite is there from the clinically focused crowd?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, it continues to be a relatively diverse customer base. Some from pharma companies, a couple of these big projects like the VA project. I think you're going to see more and more from population-based sequencing programs. And if I were to turn the clock forward a year or 18 months, I would think that you're going to have more and more from these large programs. Some of those will wind up with local installations of HiSeqs, but some of them may, particularly in the earlier phases, use outsource services to get that work done. So I think the trend there is a good one. I still think that, as I said probably 2 years ago, that the outsource part of whole human genome sequencing is going to be an important but not significant part of the overall dollars in the marketplace, sort of in the 5% to 10% range, ultimately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A couple of questions for me. First off, thanks for the disclosure around the ALL transaction. Just, I guess, the last housekeeping question here, what is that going to add in terms of revenue to 2013?","Jay T. Flatley","The revenue is insignificant, Bill, so it's not measurable.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Got it.","Jay T. Flatley","In terms of our overall revenue, at least.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Willing to take a shot at what we should expect in 2014? We certainly recognize, Jay, that due to some of the collaborations it obviously will ramp up once some of those products get commercial. But, I guess, how should we think about this pacing over the next couple of years?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I wouldn't think about the ALL revenue being standalone revenue. It's going to be so tightly integrated into what we're delivering as part of our product mix, that it will be indistinguishable into 2014. Yes, there'll be some revenue from the partnership projects, but those are, frankly, at this point, still speculative and we don't control the distribution channel there, so we can't really count on that revenue.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then as a follow-up, and maybe a little bit bigger picture question here, but we haven't seen any material expansions of HiSeq in terms of throughput since the D3 launch a couple of years ago. So how should we be thinking about the future evolution here? Perhaps just HiSeq is one category versus some of your pipeline technologies?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we have, as we said many times before, lots of degrees of freedom in terms of where we move the platforms in the SBS chemistry. And the important thing we did over the past 18 months with HiSeq was to accelerate the time of the runs, and that's really what customers wanted, was the most important new feature and new capability. It was frankly less important that we moved the total output up. And in fact, HiSeq now if you're doing anything other than whole human genomes, you need to multiplex lots and lots of samples. And so other than that segment of the market, it doesn't make sense to continue to push it too far too fast. As the market continues to go more and more toward whole human genome sequencing, clearly we'll have the capability to put higher output technologies into the market and continue to drive down that cost per whole human genome. So we're working across all those fronts, but we've prioritized speed of the runs, and that's why you saw the 2500 and that's what we're really going to focus on here in the next kits that's coming out on HiSeq before the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Amit Bhalla with Citi Group.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jay, I just wanted to know if you could just talk a little bit about reagent consumption between the 2500 and the 2000 now that the 2500 seems to have been gaining some good traction? And also, can you give us a sense of utilization rates amongst your clinical customers versus your traditional academic customers from the reagent side?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I mean, I don't have the breakdown by system type in front of me of reagents. They're not radically different. So it's not something where we're seeing a 2x or even a 50% difference whether a customer has a 2500 or not. And even if they have a 2500, they probably run it half the time on average, for standard mode. And so I don't think that distinction is one that we spend a lot of time trying to focus on. I'm sorry, the second part of your question was on...","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, it was on the clinical customers. Because now that your customer base is also diversifying, and I had one quick follow up after that.","Jay T. Flatley","I think in the clinical markets, what we see is a sort of a bimodal distribution of reagent usage. You'll have customers initially buy the systems, whether it's a HiSeq or MiSeq, and use it in a development mode to begin to put their assay together. And during that mode, the consumption often isn't very high. And they're trying to sort of sort out exactly what genes to include in the panel, for example. Very often, they working on the informatics to improve the data analysis so they don't even need to run the system during that phase. And then you have the other customers who've gotten over that initial hurdle and are beginning to actually deploy the technology. And when you look at that customer base, the utilization rates are extraordinarily high, and that applies both to MiSeqs and to HiSeqs. So you find them in both camps, and then the net of that effect, of course, is that it tends to average out in the middle somewhere.","Marc A. Stapley","And, I mean, I would say another factor that plays into that is the amount of Sample Prep and the complexity of Sample Preparation that goes into that as well that, that can also create some kind of bimodal distribution in that population.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just a quick follow-up on Moleculo as a kit-able product. I think you said in the prepared comments that you plan to roll that out in the coming quarters. It sounds like there's a couple of gaming factors there. I thought it was more of a kind of end of 2013 rollout. So can you maybe just talk about Moleculo as a kit-able solution?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I mean, that remains our goal. We expect to have at least an early access before the end of the year. It may slip a little bit into 2014, depending upon how the product development goes here over the next quarter or 2. The challenges here are around areas like informatics. So we have to really work on optimizing both the ease of use for the front end Sample Prep part of this. But also, the compute time on the back end is important. And what we don't want to do is put a commercial product out there where the customers get overwhelmed by the computing requirements necessary to phase a genome or to get the synthetic long reads. And so there's a significant amount of work we're doing on that part of it as well, which is sort of unrelated to the actual chemistry.","Christian O. Henry","And of course, Amit, by running it in our services lab, customers are getting experience with the data and what it can do in the different kinds of applications, but we're also getting experience on how to optimize the workflows. Jay said the workflow, making it a very simple workflow is a key ingredient to making it successful to the market. And as Jay said, early access around the end of the year is what we're shooting for right now.","Jay T. Flatley","And, that's why we were able to deploy it in the services environment first is because the simplicity of the workflow is less important. We can obviously train our internal team and they know how to run this quite well. It's different if you start offering it broadly to any customer who wants to buy it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question is just on the competitive environment. Jay, I know you mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but just wondering kind of given the slower pace of improvement in product introduction from your key competitor, just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color about what type of impact you've seen on your business from maybe a demand and\/or pricing perspective?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I guess, we break our market, really, into the 2 segments, the higher throughput segment and the desktop segment. And clearly, while maybe a year or 2 ago, there was some marketing of the competitive technology as potential replacement for HiSeq, I think that has tended to diminish quite significantly over that period of time. And so I think we're competitively in great shape with respect to HiSeq and particularly with the 2500 there. The desktop market remains competitive. I mean, they're a very capable and aggressive competitor and so we fight for all those orders. But I think we're continuing to win the vast majority of those where we're present. And again in the script, we said that, that number is at least 80%. And we're working on the coverage to make sure that we get into these other markets and geographies and application areas where we're not historically as strong.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then maybe to follow-up on a separate topic, well, your nonacademic mix is growing rapidly, still be interested in just to get an update on what type of growth you saw this quarter from the U.S. academic and maybe the European academic customer base? And how we should think about that growth maybe as the NAH budget flattens out as the new fiscal year approaches?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I mean, we're continuing to see growth in the academic market. It's obviously largely driven by expansion of applications coming on the sequencing and growth from more dollars being allocated towards sequencing, and it's burdened by the fact that there's less total dollars to go around. And so while there's continued angst about the reduction in the NAH budget and we would love to see it increase as much as anybody else would, academically, we continue to do well. So I think that it remains a positive for us if all of a sudden the NAH budget went up 3% instead of down 5%, we'd do even better in those academic segments, but I think we're more than holding our own there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","So just a couple of questions on sequencing. I think you said in the script that instruments were up 37%. And I'm just curious, I think you also said that 85% of the installed base had now upgraded to the 2500. So I'm just thinking about the second half of the year, how you're thinking about HiSeq demand relative to the first half of the year and MiSeq demand, I guess, relative to the first half of the year. It sounded like maybe MiSeq was picking up again a little bit?","Jay T. Flatley","Just to clarify, Jon, what we said was that of the people who ordered upgrades of the 2000 and 2500, 85% of those orders have been installed. So that's quite different.","Marc A. Stapley","And the instrument revenue was up 31%.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","31%, sorry I was trying to write the notes down. I guess, I mean the question is still the same, just big picture, how -- I think there had been some effort to maybe try and do a little bit better job of pacing HiSeq so you didn't have the kind of the end of '11 event like it happened before. So I don't know, just kind of how you're thinking about HiSeq in the second half versus what you've seen here in the first half of the year?","Jay T. Flatley","I mean, I guess, as we look forward in our pipeline, which is pretty firm 6 months out and reasonably good visibility 9 months out, we continue to see a rich demand for HiSeqs coming from emergence of lots of new types of applications running on the platform. Clearly, we're seeing an increased fraction of the HiSeq market going into clinical kinds of applications and non-traditional applications. We think that's going to continue. In terms of the desktop market, that continues to do well in addition. So I don't think we're here predicting that we're going to fall off any kind of cliff that we see on the horizon. Things feel pretty good to us at this point. I think our guidance reflects the appropriate balance between upside opportunities and downside risk.","Marc A. Stapley","Let me just clarify. And when I say instruments are up 31%, that was total instruments. You'll note on sequencing instruments being up 37% was great.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","And then, I guess, the sequencing follow up, if a little surprise sequentially that services will be down just because that includes Verinata, if I'm not mistaken, and that would've been the kind of first full quarter there of Verinata. So was there any meaningful downshift in the other services that we should be aware of, just the lumpiness that you were talking about? Just any insight there?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I mean, there's certainly some lumpiness in the services number. We had one significant services contract that slipped out of the quarter into Q3 that was pretty large in terms of revenue altogether. And it will be recorded in Q3. It was simply a customer acceptance question. Had to go through a third-party on the way to customer acceptance. And so I think that was the single biggest factor in the services line. But we did have really strong contract revenue in the third quarter. So that was very positive and then we had the full addition of Verinata on top of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on sequester. I appreciate the comments you made earlier. I'm wondering if you could maybe touch on what's making your guidance for the balance of this year in the areas of the business where you have exposure? And the reason I ask is we're obviously still in the early months of settling in on the new run rate here. So I'm just trying to figure out how you guys are trying to handicap the spending behavior for your academic customers?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. It's clearly an uncertain time there and there's a wide range of potential outcomes. I mean, we're clearly watching what's happening with respect to the budget debates that are starting to kick into gear here in the third quarter. Nobody has a clue really, what's going to happen with that and I think the chances of us avoiding a continuing resolution are nearly 0. So I think by the time we get to Q4, we're going to be under some new continuing resolution. So what we've done is we've modeled a broad range of sort of down sign funding scenarios, and then we've modeled what we think are a set of upside opportunities that the company has in terms of large deals and strength across the product line, funding, stimulus in Japan, sort of solid performance in Europe with the new budget structure going into place in Europe. And we've done our best to balance that out in our overall guidance. And so it, I think, is a number that we feel relatively confident we can deliver with that set of uncertainties.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up for Marc on the financials. With regard to the step up in SG&A the last couple of quarters, can you maybe delineate a little bit between what there is core to the business from the distribution initiative that Jay mentioned and then maybe what is incremental with regards to acquisitions? And then just lastly on tax. Tax rate, you guys have done a great job there. Any material opportunities left to continue lowering the tax rate?","Marc A. Stapley","Yes, Isaac. So on the SG&A spending, I mean, I wouldn't want to be convoluting into its individual pieces, but there are really a couple of things driving that and you listed them. I mean, we've got the whole quarter now of Verinata in SG&A, obviously, which includes things like legal expenses, the sales, the sales force that Verinata has and so on. And then regular G&A. We got some of our own process improvement projects taking place that we've talked about previously on these calls, and so we've had a step up in spending in those projects in the quarter. Those are really the key elements. I'm trying to think if there's anything else, worth calling out. You're going to see more of that as we go into, as Jay mentioned earlier, as we go into the second half, and you're [indiscernible] do more of that process spending, as well as adding more to our commercial infrastructure. So our commercial sales force and so on. On the tax rate, thanks for pointing that out. I think both the operational team that is involved in moving our manufacturing to the appropriate locations plus our finance team has done a really good job in managing our exposure from that standpoint. We're now halfway through the year so we've got a couple of quarters behind us, which is why we've been able to take our guidance to about 30% for the year, and we've done that through a combination of moving more of our manufacturing to our plant in Singapore and other operational factors as well, and we'll continue to do more of that. There might be some more headroom. We do think there will be. We have been targeting to trying to get that tax on an aggregate basis for the year down to the high 20s.","Rebecca Chambers","Just remember, Isaac, next year we won't have the benefit of the double R&D tax credit.","Jay T. Flatley","Right.","Marc A. Stapley","That's correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","First off, the number you gave, the 45% of your HiSeq shipments were into commercial and clinical applications. How does that compare to prior periods, if you've been tracking that?","Jay T. Flatley","It's higher. I mean, the trend line there is very strong because in overall the HiSeq business is doing better than we expected if we were to look back a few quarters, and I think the incremental improvement is coming from nonacademic markets.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then for my follow-up, Jay, have you seen any impact on your order funnel from the Supreme Court gene patent ruling, presumably any impact of diagnostic labs wanting to get into businesses they were previously precluded from?","Jay T. Flatley","Not yet. There's a number of them who've announced diagnostic tests, but I don't think any of them are actually at the point where they've deployed those. They've announced that they're going to deploy them. And clearly, there's new litigation on top of those announcements that I think will be ruled on relatively quickly in terms of whether there's potential injunctive relief here. But no one to my knowledge has ordered new platforms, for example, to sort of host those new tests.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid with Wedbush Securities.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","With respect to ALL, can you give us a flavor for how the technology might be commercialized? Is it something that would be integrated directly into a MiSeq or HiSeq or a future platform?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I can generally answer that. Obviously, we don't talk specifically about our developments until we're ready to nearly launch them, if not launch them. But if you can imagine that the ALL technology could be used extensively in the Sample Prep process. And the ability to use smaller amounts of reagents impacts the cost. In particular, it influences ease-of-use because the customer gets rid of lots pipe hitting [ph] steps and multiple operations that are needed in the existing Sample Prep environment. For our high throughput customers, they're largely doing that on robotic platforms of various sorts. But for low throughput customers, it's more of a manual operation and we have the, potentially, the technology to really make that go way largely. If you fast-forward some number of years, then clearly, this gives us an interesting technology to begin to increasingly integrate with the sequencing itself. And over time, you've seen us pull more operation on the [indiscernible] and you'll see us continue to move in that direction of [indiscernible] Sample Prep to be more decoupled in some cases, in some [indiscernible] great core technology to begin to work on that problem.","Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Interesting. And then just kind of a high level question about the diagnostics business. How would you compare the relative sizes and growth rates of the various areas like cancer versus total prenatal versus consumer or other kind of growing segments of that business?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, if you look back a couple of years, consumer was clearly at the head of the pack in terms of the speed of growth and actual revenue. The last two years, it's clearly been eclipsed by what's happened in NIPT. That market has evolved faster than I think anyone could have ever imagined. And I'm hearing just stories all the time. We were out on a road trip talking to investors and we ran into multiple people who had actually had firsthand experience with the test itself, not, sorry, the Verinata version, but of the general NIPT testing. So the awareness level is spreading at rates that are unprecedented here. So that market is large and growing quite fast. I think if you look forward 3 years, 4 years, it will probably be overwhelmed by what's going to happen in the cancer market. And that's because the number of opportunities you have to sequence cancer patients is large. There will be screening applications in cancer as well as monitoring applications. And globally, it's going to be a vastly bigger market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Jay, just around the ALL acquisition, are you going to be expanding upon their diagnostic assays?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we don't have any specific plans to announce around that now. I guess what I can say in general is that in most of the areas of the diagnostics market, our plan is to partner and to work with third parties who have intellectual property in particular areas or have know-how or distribution in particular markets. You will not see us broadly take as many diagnostic tests directly to the end users or to the physician, that's not generally our business model.","Christian O. Henry","And, of course, ALL has already got some pretty solid collaborations that we will continue to support and fulfill all of our obligations there to enable them to be successful.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And on the onco array, just as you commented around the cancer market, is that going for FDA approval and does that cannibalize the sequencing panels you're generating?","Jay T. Flatley","We don't have any current plan to put that through the FDA. We will put it in the market broadly in '14 after selling it sort of on a propriety basis to this consortium group in '13. We'll clearly monitor its usage and how customers -- sort of how they apply it and what kinds of clinical environments it gets used. So we may change our minds about that at some point. But I'd say the probability of putting that through the FDA is relatively low.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue at this time.

Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we reported a few weeks ago, third quarter revenue was approximately $550 million, an increase of 14% over the prior-year period, and our 16th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth.","Despite missing revenue expectations by 3%, we witnessed strong underlying trends in many parts of the business, including total sequencing revenue growth of 21% year-over-year and continued clinical adoption of our technologies. Specifically, shipments to clinical and translational customers again grew more than 40% year-over-year, representing approximately 40% of total shipments in the quarter.","The growth of our clinical end markets continue to be supported by adoption in oncology. Third quarter shipments to non-academic oncology customers grew 25% compared to last year. Shipments to all oncology customers has now grown to be approximately 20% of revenue.","We shared our strategy to accelerate oncology adoption via our onco panel and liquid biopsy programs. We were pleased to recently launched the initial product from this strategy, the RUO version of our RO1 onco panel branded TruSight Tumor 15. This panel is based on initial standards defined by the Actionable Genome Consortium, and is expected to drive the adoption NGS for tumor analysis in translational research. To-date, customer feedback on the content of this product has been very positive, and the IUO version is on track for release to pharma partners in the next few months.","We're also making progress on the RUO version of the R2 onco panel, which we expect to deliver in mid-2016 and will be available for use by our pharma partners in translational research study shortly thereafter.","We recently joined the worldwide innovative networking consortium, a global network of leading academic, industry, and non-profit research organizations, working to make personalized cancer care reality for non-small cell lung cancer patients. As part of the consortium, we will provide a slightly modified version of our R2 onco panel for use in their clinical trials beginning in mid-2016, which is expected to provide us valuable clinical utility data.","We're also making progress on our liquid biopsy program since our last update, including the recently announced collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which is focused on furthering the basic understanding of the biology of circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, in different cancer types. A series of seven clinical research studies will take place over the next three years, analyzing samples from approximately 1,000 patients with the aim of informing the development of liquid biopsy in clinical care. Additionally, we're beginning to see the launch of LDT products for specific ctDNA market segments from our customer base.","Our market development activities in reproductive health also contributed to demand from clinical customers in the third quarter. Sales of our pre-implantation genetic screening, or PGS products, increased more than 25% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Further, we're in the late stages of enrolling patients in our STAR trial, which will measure the impact of PGS and morphology on IVF success rates. We expect to complete enrollment in this study in early 2016 and have an analysis of the interim results in the middle of the year.","NIPT service revenue including test fees grew approximately 20% versus the third quarter of 2014, as we performed close to 50,000 tests. We recently signed a supply agreement with counsel that includes access to our NIPT patent pool, our 36 customer globally that has acquired these rights. I'm encouraged to see our customers developed NIPT LDTs, which further boost test adoption. Keep in mind as these licensees bring NIPT in-house. Revenue will decrease in services but increase in products.","We're also encouraged to see the recent Anthem decision to reimburse for average risk and are optimistic that other top payers will follow suit. The availability of our next-generation solution VeriSeq NIPT will enhance our global opportunity. We're in the final stages of the European regulatory process for the software and hope to have CE mark shortly. We will follow with the CE mark on the VeriSeq NIPT product for distribution as an IVD solution early next year.","Moving to arrays, in the third quarter, we saw a stabilization of market trends. Despite array revenue declining 17% year-over-year, now accounting for less than 15% of total revenue. Genotyping orders increased approximately 26% year-over-year, driven by DTC and agriculture customers, while pricing was stable compared to the second quarter. We now expect 2015 array revenue to decline low double-digits, or essentially \u2013 projecting essentially flat orders for the year, which bodes well for shipments in 2016. In the ag market specifically, we believe there's an opportunity to genotype millions of samples over the next few years. As a result, we're projecting array revenue to grow slightly in 2016.","Additionally, our new product introductions including the drug DrugDev array, MethylationEPIC array, and the ImmunoArray are also expected to boost demand. We've received positive customer feedback on these introductions as order volumes are growing, and shipment of the arrays will commence shortly.","In summary, while disappointed in the Q3 revenue shortfall, our conviction in our longer-term strategy in markets is stronger than ever. As we move into 2016, our product development pipeline is rich, and we're excited about opening the many large untapped markets ahead.","I'll now turn the call over to Francis who will provide a detailed overview of our product results.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Thanks, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. I'm pleased to provide to further details on the performance our product families in the third quarter.","As we shared a few weeks ago, the HiSeq family of products exceeded our expectations due to demand for high-throughput instruments in the Americas. On a year-over-year basis, this resulted in flat instrument revenue for our high-end portfolio, as lower HiSeq X shipments, which was expected given the record HiSeq X placements in the prior-year period, was fully offset by strength in the HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq 4000.","In spite of the challenging comparison, HiSeq X interest was strong as orders and shipments exceeded our prior guidance. We are pleased with the health of our funnel, and as a result continue to project quarterly orders of 20 to 30 HiSeq X units, building off of our current installed base of more than 250 instruments.","Demand for HiSeq X was generated from new customers, bringing the total customer count to 25, as well as existing sites expanding capacity to initiate additional projects. One example is the shipment of 10 HiSeq X instruments to the Broad to enable the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's project to sequence 20,000 individuals.","HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq 4000 continue to generate strong interest, due in part to customers accessing improved operating economics as well as adding capacity. HiSeq 4000 again was the leading platform sold, which lifted ASPs for the family of instruments compared to the prior year.","In the quarter, commercial customers accounted for 40% of instruments shipped. We continue to benefit from pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers purchasing systems to aid in the discovery and validation of genomic-based targets, as well as molecular diagnostic, and reference laboratories ramping capacity to support NIPT and oncology-based LDTs. We remained bullish on our high throughput instrument portfolio, given its tremendous flexibility to address various budgets and scientific priorities.","Moving to our benchtop instruments, as we previously shared, NextSeq and MiSeq instruments placements were lower than we had forecasted. NextSeq sales were stable both year-over-year and sequentially, and MiSeq had a very slight decline over the same time period.","We are confident this result was not due to a change in the competitive dynamics as our win rates have remained stable at greater than 80%. We received our 4,000th MiSeq order during the quarter, with clinical and forensics customers supporting demand. Since launch, we have placed approximately 40 instruments into the forensic market, a figure we expect to continue to meaningfully ramp. Additionally, we continue to build the MiSeq menu to encourage further interest from new research and translational customers.","The introduction of our TruSight HLA solutions and Tumor 15 panels, coupled with our new-to-NGS promotion bundle, have created a strong pipeline heading into the fourth quarter, as tracked opportunities have grown by more than a third compared to the levels seen entering Q3.","We see this trend with NextSeq as well as the instrument pipeline has grown significantly sequentially. Approximately 50% of NextSeq orders came from clinical and translational centers. This is an upward trend as demand from our NIPT partners in China continue to penetrate the opportunity in the region. As a result, NIPT-specific NextSeq orders grew 60% versus the prior year.","These market dynamics give us confidence that the benchtop segment will remain an important element of our portfolio going forward. In an effort to ensure that this is the case, we are continuing to add to our sales team and are heightening the focus on this segment.","In informatics, we continue to see progress in the adoption of BaseSpace during the third quarter. App launches grew 13% sequentially as approximately 50,000 runs were uploaded from the 3,000 instruments connected to our cloud offering. We are forecasting these strong trends to continue, based in part on the recent introduction of the BaseSpace Professional and Enterprise editions, which fully integrated LIMS solutions and advanced infrastructure upgrades.","These versions of BaseSpace will be available in the beginning of the first quarter to enable researchers to select some advanced services that are optimized to enhance their experience, while improving efficiency in sequencing labs.","This introduction wouldn't have been possible without the recent acquisition of GenoLogics, a life science tools LIMS provider. Coupled with our BaseSpace offering, GenoLogics Clarity LIMS solution will provide a seamless sample to answer solution for our customers.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our third quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Francis.","As Jay mentioned, total revenue grew 14% year-over-year, consistent with our preliminary estimate. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 18%. Geographically, this result was driven by strength in the Americas, which was partially offset by lower-than-expected revenue growth in Europe and APAC, as we previously outlined.","Strength in sequencing consumables and services was offset in part by instrument revenue, which declined 3% year-over-year to $145 million in the third quarter. Consumable revenue was $321 million, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2014 as higher demand for sequencing consumables was partially offset by a decline in arrays. Consumable revenue represented 58% of total revenue, up from 54% in the prior-year period and the 56% we saw in Q2.","As we've previously shared, sequencing consumable revenue was robust, growing 36% over the Q3 of last year and $20 million sequentially, to approximately $270 million. Both HiSeq X and NextSeq utilization exceeded their respective guidance ranges. We are now forecasting NextSeq pull-through to remain elevated, and as a result are increasing the guidance range to $100,000 to $125,000 per instrument annually.","We're also raising the HiSeq X pull-through guidance range to $650,000 to $700,000 per instrument as a result of positive utilization trends across the customer base. Again, this quarter, a handful of HiSeq X sites accounted for more than 70% of consumable shipments. But importantly, we saw early signs of success and increasing utilization across the many remaining customers. Additionally, we believe opening up the HiSeq X to non-human whole genome sequencing will boost utilization platform accounts that have access to agriculture or animal samples.","MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000 and HiSeq pull-through per instrument excluding HiSeq X was in our projected range of $300,000 to $350,000. Year-to-date, we have removed approximately 90 instruments from our installed base figure to account for fully decommissioned older instruments, primarily due to the success of HiSeq 3000 and HiSeq 4000 replacing them in the lab.","Services and other revenue, which includes the genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew 23% versus Q3 2014 to $79 million. This improvement was driven by growth in NIPT services, which benefited from increased test send-out revenue, genotyping services, and extended maintenance contracts associated with the larger sequencing installed base.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release. Also note that we have, as previously communicated, consolidated the results of our Helix joint venture into the results of Illumina, and accordingly all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders after non-controlling interests.","Our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 73.2%, flat versus the prior-year period and an increase compared to 72.4% in the second quarter, primarily due to the higher mix of consumables previously noted.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $90 million or 16.4% of revenue, higher compared to $85 million or 15.8% of revenue in the second quarter, due to the impact of additional head count on outside services. Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $115 million or 20.9% of revenue, an increase compared to $103 million or 19.2% of revenue in the previous quarter, due to expenses associated with the Helix joint venture, GenoLogics acquisition, outside services, and higher head count.","Adjusted operating margins were 36%, compared to the 37.4% in the second quarter, lower sequentially due to the impact of Helix and GenoLogics as well as the impact of higher head count.","Operating margin was lower compared to the 39.7%, reported in the third quarter of last year due to increased investment in R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth. Our investments will continue into the fourth quarter, as we grow our business to support the opportunities ahead of us, although at a pace lower than experienced so far this year.","Combining head count growth with our previously committed investments Helix, GenoLogics ERP, facilities and collaborations such as the one we recently announced with Memorial Sloan Kettering, we are expecting our fourth quarter operating expenses to grow $15 million to $20 million sequentially to $220 million to $225 million.","In the third quarter, our stock-based compensation expense equaled $32 million. For the fourth quarter, we expect this to increase to $40 million due to the impact of our annual grant program, which occurs in December along with the growing employee base.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 28.6% compared to 21.3% in the third quarter of last year, which was lower than typical as a result of the reversal of reserves related to prior-year returns.","Non-GAAP net income was $120 million for Q3, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.80. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $114 million and $0.77 respectively in the third quarter of 2014. The impact of foreign exchange lowered Q3 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.05 relative to last year.","We reported GAAP net income of $118 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the third quarter, compared to net income of $93 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the prior-year period. This quarter includes a $25 million tax benefit resulting from the elimination of stock compensation expense that our U.S. entity had charged to foreign subsidiaries and the cost-sharing agreements over a multi-year period. The elimination of these charges was undertaken in consultation with our external audit firm following a ruling granted to an unrelated third party in Q3.","Going forward, we will no longer cross-charge stock competition expense unless or until the ruling is overturned, which we believe is unlikely based on the facts that exist today. Should that occur, we would correspondingly record a significant charge in that period.","Cash flow from operations equaled $181 million. DSO increased to 68 days compared to 62 days last quarter due to a higher percentage of shipments in the third month, which is attributable to a combination with a typical deceleration we've seen in July and August as well as our ERP implementation at the end of July. Inventory increased slightly to $234 million. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $29 million, resulting in $152 million of free cash flow.","During the quarter $207 million of the 2016 0.25% convertible bonds were settled, leaving slightly more than $105 million remaining. We repurchased 188,000 shares for $37 million, leaving us with $112 million under our previously announced 10b5-1 program and $96 million of discretionary authorization.","Turning now to our expectations for the remainder of 2015, we project approximately 18% total company revenue growth and 21% growth on a constant currency basis, given current exchange rates. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be $570 million, which includes a $10 million currency headwind compared for the prior year. We have updated our 2015 non-GAAP EPS projection to $3.29 to $3.31, which includes expected fourth-quarter non-GAAP EPS of $0.78 to $0.80.","These projections incorporate a full-year pro forma non-GAAP tax rate of 27%, which assumes the 2015 federal R&D tax credit and other tax extenders are passed in the fourth quarter. If these items are not passed, our annual tax rate would increase by approximately a 150 basis points.","In conclusion, we believe the investments we are making are necessary to drive product innovation as well as market development and expansion, enabling us to catalyze the broad adoption of genomics in 2016 and beyond. Having said that, we continue to be diligent about the nature and timing of our investments.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question, and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we'll now open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I've got to try to squeeze to and because I think they're important. But as we think about what happened in the benchtop market this quarter, can you maybe just give us some comfort that this is truly a resourcing issue, not a market demand issue, in light of what we've heard around reimbursement and other another factors? And then as a follow up, Marc, I'm wondering if you're willing to give us any parameters around OpEx for 2016. Obviously, with Helix and other factors, we needed to be thinking about some of the headwind. Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tycho, I think the benchtop result was due to a combination of factors. Clearly, more feet on the street would help. We think there are opportunities that we can get over the finish line just due to time and sales focus during the quarter. As you can imagine, with products selling really well at the high end of the product line, it's always a challenge to get the sales force to focus on lower-end machines that have smaller contribution to their quotas.","Having said that, there are also some geographic impacts. As we mentioned, Japan has been doing very poorly, and that's a very rich market for MiSeq and probably accounted for a material portion of the shortfall that we had in MiSeq. And that's clearly a demand funding problem, hopefully temporary, in Japan. So I would say it's a combination of attention to that part of the market overall and overall time spent selling those products as well as some localized market demand issues.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And Tycho, on our operating expenses for 2016, we're in our normal budget cycle; nothing unusual about that right now, and we're going through that at the moment. I think probably the best thing to focus on is the prepared remarks that I gave around our Q4 rate. That clearly gives you a sense of the exit rate is for the year. And the items that I specifically called out are clearly going to \u2013 most of them are going to have an impact in 2016, in particular, we quoted out Helix, which is about a $0.10 impact on 2016.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking the question. So a number of competitors have launched product enhancements or new instruments in sequencing and adjacent areas over the past year. These developments, combined with a couple weaker-than-expected quarters and uncertainty about the growth outlook heading into 2016, have heightened focus on what we should expect the return to be on your investment in R&D.","Recognizing that you're still targeting an open-ended growth opportunity, your development track record in the space has been unrivalled over the past decade. And also noting that you don't want to outline your game plan too specifically for competitive reasons and also because you don't want to stall the market, I'm just wondering what you can tell us, knowing what you know about your new product development efforts. And I guess more specifically, or maybe to cut through all of this, Jay, would you just comment on how you would describe your enthusiasm and excitement about the portfolio as you think about the growth outlook and competitive dynamics over, say, the next 12 to 24 months? And how does that compare to where we were, say, a year or two year ago? Thank you.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start by saying, as I think I commented in my opening remarks, Doug, that we have a very rich portfolio of product opportunities. In fact, our challenge is in figuring out what to do next. It's figuring out what to pick from among a wide variety of incredible opportunities in new markets we can approach. We're probably putting less of a percentage of our total R&D investment in to platform technologies because we're broadening our investment horizons over the software space sample prep products like NeoPrep. It's very important for us to deliver these full sample-to-answer solutions. But having said that, the actual dollars going into platform development are higher than they've ever been. And we have great products in that pipeline. Obviously we can't talk specifically about what those are or when they may come to market.","Having said that, we also have a slightly different market position today than we did a few years ago, and by that I mean that when we develop a product today, that product development tends to be more complex than it was a few years ago, because we're dealing now in regulated markets. The products and the manufacturing processes around these products need to be vastly more robust. They need to have much more complete levels of documentation. Clearly, in the clinical products, we need to be running clinical trials. And all of those incremental R&D expenses are not things that directly translate into new product introductions but really enable opening up new markets in the regulated space.","And on the sales and marketing side, of course, we are now working very hard in the market development area, and we're not drafting behind other companies who are ahead of us in sequencing. And therefore, we have to make larger expenditures to open up these new markets earlier than they otherwise might be open.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good afternoon.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Derik.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Couple of quick ones. So the HiSeq X pull-through was certainly higher than I anticipated. It's like, do you see that furthering \u2013 do you see it accelerating in 2016? And I guess how do you sort of look, like, the non-human opportunity in HiSeq X reagents?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The trend line looks really good, and that's the reason that we felt comfortable bumping the range up for HiSeq X. We're clearly going to watch that here over the next few quarters and see what our prediction looks like for 2016. Clearly, for those customers that have access to large numbers of non-human samples, opening up the organisms that you can run on HiSeq X is going to have a huge impact, and there's a couple of very specific customers who are going to run very large studies because we did \u2013 we made that change. So I think that will help the overall averages.","We continue to work with those customers at the low end of the curve who are using their instruments at low utilization rates. And I think the biggest impact we can have is getting that collection of customers up from nominal utilizations up to the midrange of utilization. If we can be successful doing that, it will continue to push the overall number up in 2016.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","If I can just do a quick follow-up on that, so what is the rig hold-up in terms of getting these people \u2013 getting these customers accelerating? Is that they don't have the infrastructure in place, they don't have access samples, they bought ahead with they were ready for?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a collection of different issues. In some cases, they don't have samples. There's a couple cases of what we call vanity purchases, just wanted to be in the club purchases. There are clearly a couple of examples of customers who didn't quite realize what it takes to run a large-scale sequencing center and that's where what we're doing with the software infrastructure, we're putting it around the HiSeq systems or HiSeq X systems is being to help those customers a lot, because they now have the ability control samples and re-queue samples and create a pipeline of data analysis.","So those are the easy ones to move forward. The more challenging ones are the ones that have indirect sample access or less sample access or the ones who just don't have a program behind the system. And there's not a lot of those, but there's a couple.","Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citibank.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hi, afternoon. Just wanted to ask maybe a high-level question on instruments. Francis, you mentioned that the NextSeq accounted for, I think, 50% of clinical placements. Just curious how the other 50% is shaping up for the MiSeq and the HiSeq in the hospital setting. We just sort of wanted to get a holistic understanding of the placement trend there.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Sure. What I talked about is, I certainly talked about NextSeq and NIPT, and said that NIPT-specific NextSeq sales grew 60% year-on-year. And other than that, we're seeing a pretty broad sort of distribution of instruments that are bought into the clinical market.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So is that to say that if you sort of took the three buckets they would all be the same size in terms of commercial hospital placements, trends per quarter?","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Not the same size, but you're seeing s distribution across all the buckets. We're certainly seeing new-to-NGS customers primarily going into the MiSeq instrument family. And so to the extent that a low of these are new to sequencing \u2013 next-gen sequencing as a whole, they tend to go into the MiSeq instruments. And if they are doing follow-on sales then they tend to migrate up into our higher-end portfolio.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Very often in the translational category, we see more of the higher-end instruments, so HiSeqs, will be used when you're trying to do discovery or trying to figure out what methods to run. You're trying to screen through lots of samples to develop the final application and then very often they gets deployed on MiSeq when you get through the translational stages.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon. So Jay, on the last \u2013 when you did your pre-announcement, you kind of went out your way to talk about you're maintaining your 15% to 20% growth in 2016. And just kind of listening to some of the moving parts, it sounds like I think the rates are going to be flat to up slightly in 2016. Services may be down a little bit as you migrate to products on the NIPT side. So can you maybe just \u2013 maybe just talk about what it is that gives you the confidence that you can grow 15% to 20% in 2016?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. First thing I'd say is that every year we see \u2013 unless something catastrophic happens from a competitive perspective, we see a significant growth just on the consumables from the instruments that we'd placed the year before. So that's a great base line to build on. Average risk is going to be a big factor for us in 2016, so I think that we will begin to see in the first half of the year, maybe the second or third, approval from major payers for average risk, and that will begin to move that market ahead very, very quickly.","We suspect \u2013 we've been saying this for a couple of quarters now, but we do expect Japan to come back in 2016. The infrastructure's in place and the money is going to start flowing back into Japan during 2016. So that will be huge for us because Japan has been our single most troubled geography by a wide margin over the past 18 months. So any recovery in Japan is going to have a huge positive impact for us. And as we noted in the script, arrays were a pretty big drag overall in 2015 from the growth rate perspective, and having that come back to being flat to positive is going to be big help to us as well.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","To some extent, I'd say also had an increase in our population sequencing services revenues slightly as the (33:07). Yeah.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","And just a quick follow, Jay. Would you \u2013 a question I get a lot is on sequencing instruments, given or you've been with the HiSeq Xs, would you expect those to be up in 2016, sequencing instruments?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Instruments overall or HiSeq X's?","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Instruments overall, sequencing instruments overall.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't think we're ready to give that level of guidance here today, John. We're working through right now what the components of our forecast look like for next year. I mean we do think we'll have a good instrument year next year, but we're not ready to guide to the specific growth rates of instruments versus reagents next year.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Ross.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","You obviously launched a cancer panel in the quarter. You've got a key product on the discovery side that you talked here. Can you talk a little about, one, sort of the early market response there? And then two, what are your conversations are like with pharma partners and FDA and all the other constituents in terms of the pushes and pulls on sort of adoption of some of these type of products?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Well, the early indications on the TruSight Tumor 15 are very positive, as I mentioned in the script. It's too early to have any revenue slope on that. We just launched the product, so, way too early to comment with actual evidence. But the content that we put on that panel was done in collaboration with the AGC, and these are the thought leaders in the field. So we think we have the content right.","The challenge, of course, with respect to the regulated markets here, is that we really need to sell this into research segments only. We can't sell this as a diagnostic product. So it'll be used initially by research and translational customers, by pharma companies as we get into the IUO phase of these products. And we're still evaluating the extent to which we decide to put this product versus the \u2013 our two product through the FDA as an IVD or whether we do both. And that decision is pending, and it depends a bit on where the FDA winds up with the LDT guidance. And I think we're going to have some updates to the LDT guidance here over the next quarter or so and that will give us a bit more visibility on how and to what extent and what the timing will look like on LDT regulation and that will help inform our decision to put any of these products through as IVDs.","The underlying challenge here, of course, is that if it takes multiple years in large clinical trials to get one of these only through the FDA, and LDTs are not regulated, it's very hard to ever have an IVD product that would wind to be competitive a couple years after you submit it, or begin the clinical trial work, or on a lockdown product, and so that's the technical challenge we're facing.","The other area that we were having, of course, is reimbursement, and that was also alluded to in a prior question. And this is a challenging area for many of our customers. It's something that we and others are working on. We're beginning to work directly with the payers, as we've mentioned before, to try to begin to demonstrate very clear health economic outcomes from the use of sequencing in oncology, in rare, undiagnosed diseases, and in another areas to begin to get the payers over the hump of reimbursing these products.","And the last thing I might say that again we've mentioned before is part of what we're trying to accomplish here is to set more explicit standards in the marketplace. You can imagine the challenge that the payers have with the diversity of oncology panels that are coming into the market, all sequenced with slightly different methods. There's different sample preps, different depths, different software. It's a bit of a nightmare for them to sort through that and figure out which of those they should reimburse. And so what we're doing with the AGC is an attempt to begin to set some standards around what the content and the methodology should be for sequencing in oncology to allow the payers to make earlier and more timely decisions.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Jay. And maybe, Marc, just, again, not to belabor the point in repeat Tycho, but just sort of trying to understand the pacing. I guess as we think about the step-up Q4 versus Q3 on OpEx, obviously a portion of that is stock comp. I guess as we think about the other elements, it seems like some is going into commercial and then also you have your natural Q4 R&D ramp that will be sort of the jump off point for next year. And you had pretty high operating margin incrementals in Q1 and Q2 of this year.","So I guess, as we think about it, should we sort of be in investment phase for at least the next several quarters and then depending on what the back half of next year is, we could see some expansion on? I'm not looking for numbers; I'm just looking sort of directionally, maybe, or qualitatively how to think through that, at least next two three quarter pacing?","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Well, I think, clearly, as I mentioned, our pacing on certain investments is slightly reduced compared to where it was in the first half. But you're right, I gave you the jumping-off point. Bear in mind, that from that jumping-off point, we're going to have the full quarter effect in Q1 of the hiring in Q4, which is continuing, and we're going to have the 2016 hiring, which is part of our budget process, which we really haven't finalized yet. So I can't \u2013 I clearly can't give you any direction around that, because we're still working through it. But we're fairly going to be continuing to hire and grow our business at a certain pace yet to be determined.","I look forward to giving more qualitative and quantitative information on that when we finish our budget and we give guidance, but I think what we've given so far with respect to Q4 is probably the best representation of the jumping-off point on which to build from, from thereafter. And then add to that some of the specific investments that we have talked about, and assume there's a going to be other things that we need to do in 2016 that we haven't budgeted for or planned for yet.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Ross, just to add a bit to that, consistent with our long-term commentary, we're very comfortable with operating margins around the 55% range \u2013 35% range, sorry. (39:38-39:46). Yeah. 35% range. And as we get above that, and this year we got up into 39%-plus territory, we look really hard at whether we're investing fast enough to continue the growth, whether we're investing enough in our new product opportunities, whether we're developing the markets. And where we fall in that range between the 35%-ish up to the high 30%s, will depend on what the sort of platform of opportunities are there ahead of us. And we evaluate that every year, and some years are bigger investment years and some years are years where we sort of reap the advantage of the investments we made the years before. And so we'll come out and give you more specifics on that as we get into guidance for next year.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","That's perfect guys. Thanks so much.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Ross.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy from William Blair.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Sort of as a follow-up maybe for Francis and Marc, so, in terms of the HiSeq X Ten guidance that you gave, into the 20 unit to 30 unit shipments, and then looking at your backlog, can you help us or give us some context around what you're assuming in terms capacity expansion versus new customers? Obviously the Broad had a nice expansion there, but would expansion \u2013 or is expansion something that you're assuming in that number, or would that be upside? And then also just thinking about HiSeq X Five versus HiSeq X Ten would be helpful. Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Sure. So the number we gave in terms of 20 units to 30 units a quarter includes both customers that are new customers as well as customers that are coming back and expanding their fleet and we've continued to see in the previous quarters a good mix of both. And as we look at the pipeline for the future quarters, we continue to see a healthy mix again of customers that are new customers to the HiSeq X family as well as some expansions like we highlighted. So that's \u2013 that continues to be built into our plans for the HiSeq X going forward.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","On the HiSeq X Five, HiSeq X Ten, I mean we've always tried to guide towards not thinking about those as separate instruments within the family. Just think about the HiSeq X family. And the primary reason for that is the HiSeq X Five is often a kind of stepping stone to HiSeq X Ten, and we do expect many \u2013 not all, but many customers who buy a HiSeq X Five to migrate to the HiSeq X Ten over time.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Do you see the expansion kind of in chunks like the Broad, or are we looking more at sort of one-off adds here and there?","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","We see both. Honestly we see ones that have reached HiSeq X Ten and are buying a number. We see some that started at HiSeq X Five and are already looking at stepping their way up towards HiSeq X Ten. And then we see some of that are HiSeq X Ten and adding onesie, twosies. So already we do see that mix.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And often, it's driven by the specifics of what happens to their model. So in the case of Broad, it was the award of a major new program. And those are the situations that caused customers sometimes buy five or ten new ones. We've had \u2013 there's another very large customer we have that tends to buy in large chunks as they open up new parts of the market they're going after. And then in contrast, the ones who buy in onsie, twosies are just kind of expanding what they're already doing.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro, from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you very much. I wanted to start with a question on \u2013 actually both questions on the diagnostics market opportunity. And one would be, I think, as was mentioned earlier, that there were some setbacks around reimbursement this quarter from a lot of the customers that you have. And I was wondering if you could update us on what you think you guys can do to help those customers get paid for doing more complex tests like tumor profiling, like immunosequencing, and then maybe thematically what you're hoping to see from the regulators over the next 12 months to 18 months, whatever timeframe you're comfortable with.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, there's a number of things we're doing there, Isaac. We're working through some of the trade agencies or trade consortia to begin to influence the actual regulations themselves or the reimbursement statements that came out from CMS. And so that, we hope, will have influence to get what we think is kind of misguided results there fixed.","At the same time, we're doing all things that I mentioned before, trying to create standards which helps reimbursement, ultimately getting products through the FDA which assist with reimbursement as well, and clearly we're working outside the U.S. in all the other reimbursement situations to try to get products approved there. We talked a lot about what's going on in Europe with CE-IVD, and it's much easier to get our products through in Europe. And so that's a really important focus for us, particularly in NIPT.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Maybe...","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","In addition to that we're also doing work on \u2013 in some areas we're actually doing clinical trials like the STAR trial to demonstrate the value of NGS in the IVF process. And so there are number of areas where we're actually supporting trials; we're actually doing trials ourselves to accelerate that process.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks Francis. Just maybe a follow-up on the technology side. You guys obviously have done a great job innovating on the equipment over the years for all customers. And curious as you think about what kind of engineering needs to be achieved to make this technology more accessible. You didn't mention NeoPrep, but I'm curious how important is that to, for example, making the sample prep process easier, just maybe thematically what kind of engineering areas of focus do you have to help enable the market? Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. NeoPrep's a very important product for us, and the underlying technology there of digital fluidics will become increasingly important. We bought ALL because we saw that technology is being fundamental to improving ease of use of our technology over a long of period time, and it'll take many embodiments as we look at our pipeline here over the next three to five years of products that we'll use that in derivatives of that methodology.","But to open new marketplaces with the goal of getting down, ultimately, to perhaps every hospital, even, these technologies are going to have to get incredibly simple to use. And that's the track we're on, and we've made tremendous progress. NeoPrep is just one step in that direction. An awful lot of work has to go into the software side. And the progress we've made with BaseSpace and the app store is a huge help there as well, getting rid of the challenges for the small institutions of storing and moving and managing and sharing data. BaseSpace takes care of all that heavy lifting and gives them instant access to many, many applications.","So we have to sell that on the back end of the sequence or the front end, and increase the overall integration. And you'll see us over time increase our focus on solutions selling where we're not selling a box and then a sample prep kit and then an individual software package. We're selling one part number that embodies the full solution that the customer is looking for, and you've seen the early embodiments of that in forensics and HLA.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That all make sense. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you. Just a follow-up to John and then also Isaac's question, how sensitive is your 15% to 20% outlook through 2016 to progress on the reimbursement front? I mean you spiked out NIPT in Anthem, but I'm not sure what else needs to happen.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it clearly has some sensitivity to what happens in average risk. So I'd say that's the area of sensitivity. I don't think it has much sensitivity in 2016, at least, to what happens, for example in reimbursement of cancer or oncology panel. That's still probably in the noise level for us in 2016.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray.","Bill R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks and good afternoon everyone.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Bill.","Bill R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","So first question, I guess, is a bit of building off of Amanda's. And so thinking about the reiterated HiSeq X placement guidance, how many potential HiSeq X customers do you think there are today, given the existing applications? And I know that we've talked at long length on different conference calls about opening up the system further, and I know you have no plans to do so now, but would that number change should you change that decision down the road? Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","If by that you mean if we opened it up to exomes, would the number get bigger, the answer is yes. I mean the number would definitely get bigger. 25 customers is beyond \u2013 way beyond our initial expectation for this, as you know. And we continue to see customers coming forward that surprise us almost every quarter. We get a customer that \u2013 wow, we never thought that this customer would have interest in the HiSeq X technology. I do think opening up to other organisms will increase the number of customers as well. There are number of sites that, that want to do with very large-scale ag programs, and the HiSeq X technology could be the exact solution to open up some new market segments there. So we don't know what the actual number is, but certainly having 25 customers after seven quarters is a pretty darn good start.","Bill R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Very good. And then just a real quick one on Helix, Jay, any update in terms of new partners into that program?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","None that we've announced, but we have a very rich pipeline at Helix. In fact, it's so rich now that we've begun to stop trying to bring new ones in to the ecosystem. We're trying to bring up the ones that we have and nurture the agreements with the ones that are in the pipeline. So we've got a pretty big portfolio of opportunities there and we continue to be really excited about the prospect of having a suite of applications at the time we launched this.","Bill R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. That was a good one. Just a quick on one following up on the HiSeq X. If you look at the \u2013 let's say the workflows that you've seen historically on the HiSeq platform overall for human versus non-human whole genomes, how would you say that they compare to each other? It would just be really helpful for thinking about how the change to the operability on the HiSeq X impacts the funnel. Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Maybe you can clarify that for me, Steve a little bit. What do you mean the difference in the workflows?","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So the \u2013 in terms of the volumes, right? So, human whole genomes versus non-human whole genomes.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Well, I would say that human has been the dominant part of the whole genome market for obvious reasons, that we're all trying to study human disease and make those connections, determinations about the association with genome with disease, and the impact of environment as well. The challenges are different when you're doing plants and animals. In some of the plants, the genomes aren't deployed, and so they're much more difficult genomes to sequence. But if we could sequence them routinely, then there will be a lot more sequencing going on in corn and wheat and some of the more complex crops.","I think the early work that will get done here is in the animal space, probably bovine in particular. And there'll also be a lot of work done in model organism, so mouse and rat, I think, will be huge applications. And the samples there are \u2013 you can essentially get as many as you want compared to human, obviously, and you can modify those organisms in ways that let you study them as a model system that you can't do in human. So it's a very different kind of workflow \u2013 work set. That the workflow is the same, but end goal of the study is quite different.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, good afternoon. Jay, you called out the strong growth in clinical and translational demand. Could you provide some details on how that varied across the various geographies and how that might change over the coming quarters as you introduce the cancer panels into Europe, first with the CE mark, and slowly start coming into the U.S.?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So I'd say, the U.S. was far and away the strongest geography. If you look at NIPT specifically, Europe was very strong in NIPT because of all the tech transfer agreements we've been able to do in Europe, and of course we can't do those same types of agreements in the United States. So the clinical adoption, while the volumes tend to be lower in any given site because it's much more fragmented, the number of customers we have in Europe is way higher than those that we have in the U.S. We tend to sell more instrumentation in Europe as a result of that. Just because the geographic weakness in Japan and that the lack of clinical adoption overall there, it's been very weak market in the clinical side. China is pretty good, obviously driven by NIPT, and hopefully assumed by PGS and IVF markets as well.","As we look forward, I think the adoption of the onco panels will probably again be led by the U.S. If we ever get to the point where we get an IVD approval because we think we're lined up to do that quickly and we're at a point where the technology won't be obsolete by time we ever got it through the FDA, then I think that would cause an inflection point in the curve in oncology in the U.S.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Hey, Jay, you cited the competitive win \u2013 head-head to win rate as the reason giving you confidence that the issue in the desktop market is not a competitive thing. What gives you confidence, I guess, that your sales force is properly aligned and you're seeing all the opportunities out there? And I guess the second question I had was what's driving the Q4 guidance to be lower than the implied guidance that you gave last quarter? I know you said that Q4 demand was higher, I believe, than Q3 demand in the desktop markets, something you said on the last call. So what's creating the reduction in guidance there in Q4?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we can ever never be sure that we're seeing every \u2013 accounted every sale out there, but we \u2013 I mean we have a very big sales force now, and it would be shocking if we missed more than handfuls of potential sales that happen in any given quarter. The only exception to that might be China, where it's a very big geographic market and it's impossible to cover all laboratories there. So some of our larger competitors may have more feet on the street in China, so there maybe a few opportunities that we're missing there. But around the rest of the world, we're quite confident that we're getting to all the major accounts. And including in places like Europe, many of these sales happen through tenders, so they're publicly available. So we see them and we know where the NIH grant money is going in the U.S. from the academic side. So we're pretty confident in our win rate. And Marc, you want to talk about the guidance?","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I mean essentially it comes down to the things we talked about on our pre-call. And a couple of things that impacted Q3 in particular \u2013 our perspective on Japan is one of the key drivers, and then our view on our ability to get everything done that we need to get done in Europe. Europe has to grow sequentially to achieve that. And so we're very focused on making that happen. And then on the desktop \u2013 benchtop side, we're coming off a lower jumping-off point in Q3 sequentially. So I think those factors combined \u2013 this is what led us to take down \u2013 effectively take down our Q4 guidance as we went from 20% to 18% for the year.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call over to Rebecca Chambers for closing remarks.","Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury","Thanks again, Lauren.","As a reminder, everyone, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investor section of our website as well as through the dial-in instructions contained in today's earnings release.

Flatley","Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Given the release of our 14D-9 and the number of investors and media new to the Illumina story, I plan to discuss more of our background than I normally would on a typical earnings call. I want to begin with a few slides describing who we are, the markets in which we participate and a bit of our history. ","Illumina is a global leader in genomic analysis, with market-leading positions in both DNA sequencing and microarrays. Founded in 1998 and headquartered in San Diego, we have over 2,100 employees and a global distribution channel with direct sales in all major countries. We estimate that approximately 90% of the world's DNA sequencing data is generated using Illumina's sequencers. We have an unmatched history of innovation resulting in 9 platform systems in the market and a rich pipeline of exciting new products that we will introduce over the next few years. Our product development engine has allowed us to overtake the leader in the microarray business to take the #1 position, and subsequently, to take over the leadership in DNA sequencing to assume clear leadership in that market as well.","We believe we are singularly positioned in a nascent but rapidly growing next-generation sequencing market. NGS is poised to become the key technology to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine and to drive the routine use of genomic information in medical practice. Our leadership will allow us to capture a large market share from compelling new opportunities in molecular diagnostics, reproductive health, cancer management and industrial end markets such as agricultural, biotechnology, veterinary medicine and forensics. We have a solid track record of operational performance and execution over a period of many years, a record that is rare in the industry and will continue to create shareholder value.","Illumina serves 4 interrelated markets. The core business of the company has been in Life Sciences research, a market of about $4 billion today. We have undisputed leadership in both sequencing and microarrays, with the sequencing business continuing to exhibit the fastest growth rate in the overall Life Sciences market. The applied markets are closely related and have been largely enabled by high throughput DNA sequencing. We've now developed a high-growth recurring revenue business in both the livestock and agricultural segments, which represents approximately 12% of our shipments. Low-cost sequencing has enabled the discovery of key variance in plants and animals that confer favorable traits. Once discovered, these variants are then deployed on microarrays to allow large-scale screening for these traits. Emerging opportunities here include forensics and pet genomics. ","The current addressable molecular diagnostics market is about $3 billion in size. It's largely infectious disease testing today, but it's rapidly expanding into new areas like noninvasive, prenatal testing and cancer. Our strategy is to broadly enable the large number of labs pursuing molecular diagnostics using NGS, while we focus internally on our proprietary cancer discovery programs. In the long run, the consumer market will become one of the largest market opportunities, particularly in sequencing, but today it's just beginning to emerge. We believe that in a not very distant future, infants will be sequenced at birth and their genetic profile will be used to manage their health throughout their lifetime. Similarly, adults will become sequenced either as part of their routine medical care or as part of a broad population-based sequencing program.","Innovation is in our DNA. Since 2001, our compound average growth rate of revenue has been 83%. Our 5-year compound annual growth rate of EPS is 26%. Strategically, we have invested in R&D at a percentage rate higher than our peers, resulting in a rich product portfolio to drive growth. After going public at the tail end of the dot-com bubble, as a recently minute startup, we began to develop innovative products that enable large-scale genomic discovery. For example, we launched the BeadLab system in mid-2002 which was responsible for generating more than 60% of the data for Phase I of the international HapMap project. In mid-2005, Illumina launched its first whole genome genotyping array, the Human-1 BeadChip, which included over 100,000 markers. Continuous improvements to the array product line have allowed us to become the #1 microarray supplier in the world by a large margin. In the course of 6 years, we've increased the content capacity in one array from 100,000 markers to 20 million markers, a staggering increase of 142% per year.","In January 2007, Illumina completed the acquisition of Solexa, an early stage company that had developed a breakthrough genomic scale sequencing technology. This was a rare transformative acquisition that allowed both 100x improvement in throughput and 100x reduction in sequencing costs compared to existing technologies. In April 2010, we launched the HiSeq 2000 and redefined the trajectory of sequencing, now with the ability to sequence 5 complete human genomes per run at the lowest cost per base in the industry. Over the 10-year period ending in January 2012, we have delivered 1,129% return to our shareholders.","We ended 2011 on a positive note. We recorded our second largest order quarter in our history with the exception of Q4 2009 when we received a massive order from China. Our book-to-bill ratio is 1.2 in the quarter, resulting in a strong backlog entering 2012. Revenue grew 6% sequentially in spite of the U.S. continuing resolution, and we grew revenues 17% for the year. EPS for the quarter and the year were up over 20%. While the U.S. was stable, shipments x U.S. grew 20% sequentially. Along with our partner Siemens, we submitted a pre-IDE for MiSeq with an HIV assay and expect a full submission later this year.","Our former CFO, Christian Henry is now dedicated to running our Genomic Solutions business and is also on the call with us today. I'd like to thank Christian for his outstanding contributions as CFO and for doing double duty for over 2 years. With that quick background, let me hand the mic over to Marc Stapley, our new CFO. Marc was formerly a Senior Vice President of Finance at Pfizer and has been a wonderful addition, a great cultural fit and brings a wealth of large, multinational financial and operational experience.","Marc Stapley","Thanks, Jay. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. During this section of today's call, I will review our fourth quarter financial results and discuss our financial guidance for 2012. I will then turn the call back to Jay, and he will provide an update on our commercial progress, the state of our business in markets and the tender offer from Roche. ","As Jay mentioned, fourth quarter 2011 revenues of $250 million increased 6% sequentially, due to the successful ramp of MiSeq shipments as our newest sequencing product continues to attract strong orders. Revenues for the quarter decreased 4% compared to Q4 2010, as the year-ago quarter included a significant number of HiSeq shipments associated with our Genome Analyzer trade-in program and the significant volume of HiScanSQ shipments. Revenue for 2011 was $1.056 billion, which represents an increase of 17% over 2010, reflecting primarily growth in instruments and related consumables year-over-year.","Instrument revenue for the fourth quarter was $80 million, representing an 11% sequential improvement driven by the volume of MiSeq shipments previously discussed. Instrument revenue decreased 27% year-over-year, driven by the Q4 2010 Genome Analyzer trade-in program and high scanning SQ shipments previously mentioned. Consumable revenue for the quarter was $144 million compared to $145 million in the third quarter and $132 million in the fourth quarter of 2010. On a sequential basis, consumable revenue was approximately flat, as an increase in sequencing consumables was offset by a decrease in microarray consumables. The decrease in microarray consumables on a sequential basis was due to a mix shift towards the exome array and the inability to ramp the supply chain sufficiently to meet the increased demand. The exome array has far exceeded our expectations as we have received over 1 million samples in orders to-date. The improvements in sequencing consumables with a result of the large sequencing install base and an increased sequencing pull-through per instrument. On a year-over-year basis, consumable revenue grew approximately 9%, also driven by the expansion of our sequencing instrument install base.","In our discussion of gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense, restructuring and other non-cash items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release. Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 70.2%. This compares to 68.9% last quarter and 65.1% in the fourth quarter of 2010. The gross margin included a one-time catch-up benefit in the quarter, resulting from improvements in HiSeq liabilities. Subsequent quarters will benefit from these improvements as well. The year-over-year gross margin increase was driven primarily by a favorable mix of consumable versus instrument revenue, and higher ASPs on the HiSeq 2000 as the 2010 Genome Analyzer trade-in program negatively impacted the ASPs in the fourth quarter last year. ","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $37 million or 15% of revenue, compared to 17.4% of revenue in the third quarter and 14.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010. A sequential decline of $4 million results from the actions we took during the quarter to consolidate our development side as discussed during our third quarter call. ","Adjusted SG&A expenses were $46 million or 18.3% of revenue in the quarter, compared to 22.2% of revenue in the third quarter and 19.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter 2010. The sequential decline of $6 million results from the reduction in force [ph] discussed on our last call.","Non-GAAP net income was $44 million for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS was $0.35. We reported GAAP net income of $12 million or $0.09 per diluted share in the quarter, compared to $38 million or $0.25 per diluted share in the prior-year period. As discussed during our third quarter earnings call, we realigned the company's organization cost structure given the funding uncertainties and the global economic environment. As a result, we recorded a restructuring charge of $8.1 million in the quarter and expect to incur another $6 million in the first half of 2012 as we complete those plans. GAAP net income for the quarter also includes a $30 million largely non-cash charge primarily for the fees use loss associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters, as well as a legal settlement gain of $2.3 million.","During the fourth quarter, we generated record cash flow from operations of $108 million. We used approximately $27 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $81 million in free cash flow. This compares to $69 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of last year. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Looking ahead to 2012, we expect revenue for the year of between $1.1 billion and $1.175 billion, representing continued top line growth. Gross margins are anticipated to be around 70% for the year, and our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.40 and $1.50, assuming a full-year pro forma tax rate of 33% and stock compensation expense of approximately $105 million. Based on the current stock price, we are estimating full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for non-GAAP purposes to be approximately 135 million shares. For the first quarter of 2012, we expect revenues between $250 million and $260 million, and a gross margin of approximately 69%. Assuming approximately $133 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for non-GAAP purposes and stock compensation expense of approximately $25 million, we expect non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter of $0.29 to $0.32. At this point, I will turn the call back over to Jay.","Jay T. Flatley","Thanks, Marc. To begin, I'd like to discuss several key results from the fourth quarter. Overall, we were pleased with our results in Q4 despite spending almost the entire quarter under a continuing resolution, which funded the NIH down 1.5% versus 2011. While it's hard to be certain that Q3 2011 was the bottom, many of the issues that we saw in Q3 have improved. While the global funding environment remains uncertain and peak stimulus continues to roll off, the adjusted 2012 NIH budget is now known and has increased 1% versus 2011. While we understand that the potential exists for NIH funding to be cut by as much as 8% in 2013, we believe that such a profound reduction in NIH funding is an unlikely scenario.","Turning now to another challenge we faced in Q3, our customers' adjustment to the sequencing throughput of our V3 consumable kit, that has also improved. Utilization of HiSeqs increased slightly to $273,000 in Q4, but we see several reasons to be encouraged. We're implementing a price increase in late Q1, HiSeq utilization trends have increased in Europe and Asia-Pacific, sequencing consumable orders grew 60% sequentially in Q4 and we expect our new TruSeq exome enrichment pricing to directly improve utilization. We believe sample acquisition logistics continued to improve as well, indexing workflow changes are becoming more routine and researchers' library generation has been scaled to meet the throughput of our V3 kits. Anecdotally, Q4 felt like customers were getting back to work.","I'd like to now turn to some specific results from the quarter. Q4 was a record for array orders. Both genome, custom and focused array orders all grew sequentially, with customer array orders growing over 50% sequentially and genotyping arrays up 60% sequentially. Two large consumer orders were placed in Q4 as well, including one from ancestry.com for approximately $7 million. ","Turning to our sequencing business. Total sequencing revenue in Q4 grew slightly over a year ago, attributable to increasing sequencing consumables and the first-quarter of volume shipments of MiSeq. As we experienced in previous quarters, approximately 90% of HiSeq orders and shipments in Q4 were to customers outside the major genome centers. ","Total sequencing consumable revenue grew over 30% compared to Q4 of last year. Both HiSeq and GA pull-through increased sequentially. We're pleased that HiSeq consumable orders in Q4 totaled more than in all of fiscal year 2010.","In our services business, we had a record revenue quarter and shipped 900 complete human genomes, our largest number to-date. In Q2, we expect to announce premium services products using the fast turnaround capability of the HiSeq 2500, coupled with enhanced sample prep and new informatics software. ","I'd like to now pick up the presentation on Slide 12. With the addition of the HiSeq 2500 and 1500, we now have 7 instruments in our sequencing portfolio that stand the full range of market requirements. Our flagship product is the HiSeq 2500, offering the lowest cost per base and multiple sequencing modes. The HiSeq 1500 is the single-flow cell, lower throughput, lower-priced version of the 2500. The HiScanSQ is the world's only system that can both sequence and can scan microarrays. MiSeq, our desktop entry, has had a very successful launch and is well-positioned to penetrate the diagnostics market, as well as to address the needs of our existing Illumina customers. One key aspect of this product line, of course, is that all these systems run on the same proprietary SBS chemistry, which gives us enormous leverage when we launch new platforms into the market.","In 2012, we will further enhance MiSeq to expand its breadth of performance and applications. We will provide less expensive and lower output kits to run applications that don't require the full capability of the current MiSeq. At the same time, we're also increasing the throughput of MiSeq by about a factor of 3, increasing the read lengths to 2x250 bases and reducing cycle times yet again. The new version of MiSeq can achieve up to 7 billion bases per run, and is ideally suited for running deep coverage, targeted cancer panels. Enhanced MiSeq will be commercially available in the middle of 2012, and our current install base is upgradable with a simple no charge enhancement to the instrument. We've been in active discussions with over 70 clinical partners interested in using the MiSeq for diagnostic applications. Approximately 50% of orders for MiSeq are from clinical or commercial customers, unlike the high predominance of academic customers buying HiSeqs. We expect to submit the MiSeq platform to the FDA for 510(k) approval before year-end.","At the top end of the product line, the HiSeq platform has been extremely well adopted into the clinical market and has, in fact, truly created a new market for high throughput clinical tests. In high throughput applications, HiSeq is an ideal instrument because it has the ability to tackle sequencing problems that require high depth to detect rare events or to multiplex very large numbers of samples. We doubled our placements into the clinical market in 2011 versus 2010. We show on this slide a sampling of organizations working on clinical HiSeq assays, particularly for applications that require large sample numbers.  ","In the sequencing market, our customers are increasingly focused on speed of result. The HiSeq 2500 is a new product we announced last month, with a throughput of a HiSeq 2000 but also capable of sequencing a full human genome in a day. We've accelerated the imaging, improved cycle times and reduced the imaging area. Cluster generation is automated and done onboard the instrument, ideal in a clinical setting. This technology uses a special flow cell and reagents, and has achieved quality better than or equal to what we get with a 600G run. In the genome-in-a-day mode, the HiSeq 2500 is capable of running up to 20 exomes in a day or up to 30 RNA seq samples in 5 hours. We expect to deploy this technology in our services business this month. In Q2, we expect to announce some premium products in our services business that use the speed of the 2500 to do a genome in a day and couple it with enhanced sample prep and informatics to reduce the overall cycle time to result. This capability will become very critical for applications such as clinical sequencing. The instrument itself will become available as the HiSeq 2500 in the second half of the year. The HiSeq 2000 will be sealed upgradable for a cost of $50,000.","Next-generation sequencing is a core technology for any researcher doing modern life science research. We've seen over the last month a number of important announcements that demonstrate the continued potential for very large investments in high throughput sequencing. In Connecticut, $200 million was allocated for Jackson Labs; in the U.K., over $500 million of funding for biomedical research. The New York Genome Center, a consortium of 11 academic institutions, was funded at about $125 million. And in Canada, grants for $67 million of next gen sequencing. And recently, a very exciting announcement from the Farroe Islands, the first country to announce that they intend to sequence their entire population of 50,000 people. We're now working with them to make that program a reality.","Over the next few years, we believe there will be some very large new sequencing markets emerging. If you assume $1,000 genome with a 1% penetration, the clinical trials market would be an incremental $24 million in annual revenue. The cancer market about $250 million and a newborn screening about $350 million in incremental revenue. In total, over $600 million in emerging market opportunities at a 1% penetration. We think many of these markets are going to grow to 10% quite quickly, particularly ","Markets like cancer where we think in the next few years, it would be almost irresponsible for a physician treating a cancer patient to not have that tumor sequenced.","We have a rich and deep R&D pipeline, and here's a glimpse of what we think are some of the key technical and market developments coming over the next few years. There are going to be many more sample types that become available for sequencing as the technology improves, including paraffin-embedded samples. There are approximately 100 million of these tissues, particularly cancer tumors embedded in paraffin, that will become accessible with new sample prep technology that we will bring to market. Circulating tumor cells to detect diseases early in blood will become a large market. And we're pushing the sequencing now down to the range where we will, in the next year or 2, be able to robustly sequence single cells. This will begin to give the ability to examine the heterogeneity of cancer tumors, the next frontier in cancer tumor analysis.","From a systems performance perspective, we continue to make major improvements in as many degrees of freedom. We will continue to make our clusters denser by at least a factor of 2, our cycle times can get much faster and we have a number of programs focused on long reads and long-range haplotyping. These advancements will open up new markets such as the ones we've talked about in clinical and forensics, cancer and newborn screening, and in the long run, the biggest market of all, which is the consumer market. ","Over the next few years, we will productize a number of new assays as well. We have not yet found the ultimate limit of our SBS chemistry, but at some point it probably will top out. So we're working on chemistry A that has cycle times potentially down as low as 10 seconds, very high accuracy and the ability to do long reads. This assay could work both with light-based and lightless detection systems, and have very low reagent costs. Chemistry A is sequencing today inside of Illumina.","We're also working on another chemistry we call Chemistry B. This is a single molecule chemistry with very long reads and very fast runs, but we think with some fundamental advantages over the other single molecule chemistries that have been brought to market that suffer from very low accuracy. This would yield an extremely low-cost device and low-cost runs.","In conclusion, we think we have a very exciting product line up for 2012. You'll see Illumina continue to innovate. We have a focus on strong operational execution to drive leverage in our income statement, while maintaining our technological lead. The clinical market is emerging very rapidly and will be a key story in 2012. The overall sequencing market potential is enormous, and Illumina has the technology, people and infrastructure to continue to lead this market.","Our discussion this afternoon flows well into our next slide. Our reasons for rejecting Roche's unsolicited offer to acquire Illumina for $44.50 per share. We provided significant detail on our position in our press release and our 14D-9 today, but in short, our board, with assistance from independent financial and legal advisers, determined that Roche's offer dramatically undervalues Illumina and that it's not in the best interest of our shareholders. I'm sure you can tell we feel strongly about this. We think it's clear from our track record and market leadership that Illumina is singularly positioned to capitalize on tremendous market opportunities in the years ahead. Our industry is nascent, and we're on the verge of personalized medicine becoming a reality. Illumina has the promise and potential to experience extraordinary growth in the years ahead, as genetic information becomes broadly applied beyond molecular biology research and into molecular diagnostics, reproductive health and cancer management. We would also note that we have a solid track record of performance and execution, not just in this most recent quarter but also over many years. This record is rare in the industry and we believe will continue to create value for our stockholders. We've seen in the press that Roche has no plan B. We don't disagree with that statement, since there simply is no other company like Illumina. Despite the innovation, growth and shareholder value Illumina has delivered to-date, we've only scratched the surface of the market opportunity we see in genetic analysis and diagnostics. Our market position, technology platform and pipeline, management team and culture, make us uniquely positioned to execute on this remarkable opportunity. It's the board's responsibility to protect and pursue the path that has the highest probability of delivering the tremendous value that Illumina expects to continue to create for its shareholders. For all these reasons and more, our board has rejected Roche's grossly inadequate offer. Thank you for your time, and we'll now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First one maybe, Jay, on the 2500. As you think about your install base today, how should we think about the upgrades to customers in terms of the percentage of customers you think will upgrade maybe this year and next? As we think about utilization as well in terms of 600G versus genome in a day, how do you think about the mixed utilization going forward on the 2500?","Jay T. Flatley","I can say, Tycho, to start that we've been very pleased with the customer response of the 2500 announcement. We're already accepting orders and beginning to get a fair number of those in to-date. We think there's a fairly likelihood of a reasonable percentage upgrading in the next 12 months. And we don't know exactly what that might be, but certainly, it may be in the 25% range plus, maybe up to 50%. We do think that in large installations, if you had a sequencing shop that had 20 or 25 sequencers, you probably wouldn't do them all. You might begin by doing 5 or 10 of them to take advantage of the genome in a day and then see how your mix of projects evolves over time to decide whether to continue to upgrade. In terms of utilization, if you're doing large-scale projects where lowest cost per base is the key driving criteria, most of those customers will stick with the 600G output because time isn't particularly critical. I think there'll be a large number of customers that use this selectively in the genome in a day mode for rapid turnaround for clinical applications in places where they don't want to wait for enough samples to fill up a full run. They can take advantage of the single day output. For example if you're doing exonic sequencing, you can load up the machine without waiting for hundreds of exomes to be indexed to run in the 10-day mode of the 600G. So it's hard to tell in advance exactly what that mix is going to look like, but I think they'll be used interactively.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then you mentioned the price increase on the V3 kits. Was this telegraphed to customers during the quarter? And then do we think about them buying and  ahead of the price increase? Or how do we think about that dynamic?","Jay T. Flatley","It was. The customers are aware of the price increase. There may be some buying in Q1 in advance of that. We're not counting on that happening, but there probably will be some.","Operator","We'll go next to Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So can you talk about any proactive measures you guys are taking to minimize the distraction on your organization related to the Roche bid? I guess there's 2 dynamics to this. One, are you still able to recruit top talent as you always have been able to? Any concern related to that? And then I guess externally, how are you managing this news with customers?","Jay T. Flatley","Well we do have a number of constituencies, Doug, that are critically important here, our employees, as well as our customers, as our stockholders. And the message we've given to both our customers and our employees is that it's business as usual. I mean, we are hunkered down in delivering on the products, delivering on the operational side of the business and on the order side of the business. I think in some ways, it's been a catalyst for our team to make sure that we continue to deliver. And I don't think that we run the risk of taking our eye off the ball in any way there.","Christian O. Henry","Yes, Doug, just to add, in my group, it has absolutely been a galvanizing event for us. And quite frankly, we have so many exciting things going on in product development right now that we're really focused on making sure we get the MiSeq improvements out on time, making sure we get the HiSeq 2500 off to a great start and continuing to build the services business. And so we're pretty busy internally, and so far, although it was an initial shock to some, the reality was that people immediately got right back to work. And I'm very happy with how things are going internally.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a question specific to the HiSeq franchise. In the past, I think you guys have talked about a number, and I may be slightly off, but something like 30 to 35, 30 to 40 new customers coming in almost every quarter ordering HiSeqs. Did that continue in Q4? Is that your expectation moving forward, even with a series of new product announcements made by you guys and others in next gen sequencing?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We think it will. I mean, I would say that the number we saw in Q4 was down slightly from our average but not materially. But we continue to believe that there's a market there, particularly with the 2500 enhancements as we begin to push more and more into the clinical space with HiSeq. We think that we're broadening the market, that there's more clinical adoption. You saw on the slide that I displayed just a sampling of the customers that are beginning to use HiSeqs in the clinic, and we're really excited about this because in many of these applications, the goal is to run a complex diagnostic test at price points that are dramatically less than the existing, much simpler tests. And because you can multiplex so many samples together on a HiSeq, and particularly if you can turn that around on a single day, it becomes a very potent clinical device. And so we continue to be optimistic about broadening out the market.","Operator","Over next to Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I had a question on the diagnostics side of things. Obviously, you've talked quite a bit about that. But I'm curious, given the challenges that we've seen on the data side and just the interpretation of some of the magnitude of sequencing data that's being generated. How decentralized do you think next gen sequencing can be in clinical diagnostics? Is it something that's going to evolve over time, or is it something that you could see being produced in the near term?","Jay T. Flatley","Did you say decentralized, Amanda? Is that what you said?","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, I did.","Jay T. Flatley","Well I think that we're taking a number of steps to try to deal with the data management problem and the announcement of BaseSpace was a key step in that direction, particularly for the clinical customers that are not used to large IT infrastructures and don't want to have to deal with that, BaseSpace I think offers a fantastic solution for data management, for backup, for elastic computing power, and frankly, low-cost storage as the curves begin to cross between the cloud and local storage, which we think will probably happen in the next 12 months. So that product line, I think, is strategically positioned to deal with this problem. The second dimension of the problem, of course, has to do with the ability to actually algorithmically analyze the data, and we're certainly working hard there across a number of fronts to improve the performance of our base colors, of our aligners, of all the work we do in the secondary analysis in cancer in particular, which is more challenging. And then some of the application work that we're doing in BaseSpace as we begin to deploy an app store into that environment, we'll begin to address the tertiary application needs and we'll sort of leverage the ecosystem of third-party software developers to put applications in BaseSpace that allow you to do analysis across a broad range of samples. And so I think that whole ecosystem we're building will be a big step and an important one for clinical customers.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then just a follow-up to Doug's earlier question, curious if there's been any meaningful reaction on the customer side related to the Roche bid, or are people just sort of focused on getting back to work, as you said?","Jay T. Flatley","I mean, we've obviously gotten some responses from customers, but not the kind of response where they said we're going to stop ordering from Illumina. I mean you can see in the press various articles of people that have been interviewed about reactions to the bid. But I think, even for our customers, it's business as usual. They want to keep doing their projects. They want to use the best technology in the market, and that continues to be Illumina technology.","Operator","We'll go next to Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First off, Jay, just given the ONT announcement here recently to go it alone as it relates to strand sequencing, I certainly appreciate the commentary around chemistry B. Any additional color here in terms of when you might be able to go commercial with that, obviously given the fact that ONT is talking about a 2012 launch?","Jay T. Flatley","They're talking about a 2012 launch? Yes. Well, we're not prepared today to disclose anything more about that chemistry other than the fact that we're excited about both chemistry A and chemistry B and the various market segments that those could potentially address. As you're well aware, and many others are, any new chemistry takes a long time before it can reach sort of robust commercial performance, and that was certainly true with our SBS chemistry. And I think it will be true with ONT's chemistry or anybody else's, in fact, that's brand-new. And so even though they plan to go commercial this year, there'll be questions around can it achieve the overall accuracy and robust performance that a chemistry like ours has achieved over a period of 6 or 8 years now.","Christian O. Henry","I also think the other thing, as Jay pointed out in his remarks, is that the SBS chemistry we continue to improve the SBS chemistry and we haven't really found the top of the performance curve on that, either from a read length, a data accuracy, a speed. And so you can expect us to continue evolving our products and our technology there, as well as developing chemistry A and chemistry B.","Jay T. Flatley","And I might suggest as well that our vision in the out years, a couple years from now, is that there may not be one single chemistry that's ideal for all applications. There may be particular types of chemistry that are better for long reads but may make other sacrifices. There may be some that are better for a fast turnaround, there may be others that are more accurate. And so part of the reason we're working on these multiple chemistries is that, over time, it may make sense to actually deploy different types of chemistries for different applications.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Understood. And then I guess just as a follow-up and it's somewhat unrelated, but you kind of -- let the cat out of the bag, so to speak, Jay, by calling Roche's offer grossly inadequate. And so I guess as you're thinking about the business and evaluation, where is the number where Illumina starts to get interested?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I mean, we're certainly not going to comment on anything related to numbers in the marketplace. I mean, we had 2 offers presented to us by Roche. We very diligently evaluated those offers in the context of our strategic plan, of our operating plan and of our forecast. The key responsibility of the Board of Directors in this case is to really focus on creation of shareholder value and compare those offers to what we believe we could do as a standalone company. And the decision of the board to date has been that those offers were not going to give the kind of value back to our shareholders that we would as a standalone company. And so, today, we really had only those 2 offers, and that's all we  can comment on at the moment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jay, just wondering if you could help us think about the path to commercialization for chemistry A and B. And specifically, should we assume that chemistry A will at least be partially compatible with your current instrumentation base, just given your comments on it sort of being either light or non-light based?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I wouldn't necessarily imply that. I mean, it could be most optimally deployed in a different type of instrument. So it wouldn't necessarily be compatible. It could theoretically be perhaps, but that's sort of a product development decision that we'll make down the line and will really depend upon how we want to optimize the portfolio, how we segment the market and our ability to do differential pricing. And so that's an evaluation yet to come.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then maybe one topic that's been lots of noise here as the efforts you guys have in the PCR franchising, you talked I think a little bit about having a library available of consumables maybe the second quarter. So maybe just if you could qualify or quantify how you measure success in that part of the business this year, and then maybe longer-term, what your goals are into that franchise as it relates to the rest of the business.","Jay T. Flatley","Sure. Yes. The overall revenue contribution from the eco product isn't large enough yet for us to call it out specifically in the script or in the slides, but certainly is one that we have a lot of emphasis on. We've formed a new business unit around this and led by Mark Lewis. And very importantly, we think driving the revenue in this market is going to depend on having a family of reagents to run on the platform, and we will launch those in the second quarter. We've got some proprietary technology we're deploying in those assays that we think will give us a significant advantage in overall performance compared to the competitors. And we have the ability not only to deploy that assay on our existing eco box, but to sell the assays into the entire install base of qPCRs.","Operator","We'll go next to Namdida Koshel [ph] with Barclays Capital.","Unknown Analyst","Jay, could you comment on Illumina's strategy for accessing the diagnostics market. What sort of investments would this need on an organic basis as you reorient from being a research-focused organization primarily? And then what does your pipeline of external partnerships look like to achieve that?","Jay T. Flatley","I wouldn't say we've reoriented toward diagnostics. I think what we recognized a couple of years ago is that molecular diagnostics was going to be an emerging market opportunity where sequencing over time will become the core technology, and as a result of that we began making investments in the field a couple of years ago and formed our diagnostics business run by Greg Heath. We've now broken that into 2 separate pieces. Greg is focused on developing diagnostic products that we will run through the FDA, and those will be the result of our internal discovery programs. And we're doing that in 3 cancer areas, and we'll be through the validation phase of those 3 cancers by the middle of the year. And so we're cautiously optimistic about what we might find there, and that would result in proprietary assays that we would deploy. The second part of this, of course, is the recent formation of the TCG group, the Translational Consumer Genomics group. And this is a group that we put together under Matt Posard's leadership to focus on CLIA customers in particular and the consumer market. And there's a very large number of high throughput CLIA laboratories that we think we were underserving previously the way our distribution and product development was set up. And so we have dedicated a fair amount of resources to Matt's organization, and his charter is to go after that translational market full bore. And as we said in the script, we have now discussions underway with at least 70 potential customers for deploying the technology into clinical-type applications. And we've announced publicly a couple of those partnerships, obviously Sequenom is one, a very large potential market in trisomy testing. We think it's about $1 billion per year. There's 4, 5 different companies going after this. Sequenom is the only one with an assay on the market today, but there are several others not far behind Sequenom. And at the moment at least, we're the supplier of sequencing technology to all of those customers. A second major partnership we've announced is the one with Siemens, initially focused on the HIV assay, but certainly an opportunity to expand that relationship to bring other assays onto the MiSeq platform in conjunction with Siemens","Unknown Analyst","Okay, very helpful. And Jay, could you elaborate further on the timing within your view of the development of the sequencing-based diagnostics market that you shared with us? What is the size of that business for you today or the opportunity, and what will be sort of the medium-term outlook, say, 2013, '14? And in that context, how does that ecosystem develop, because it's not just about the technology, for instance, the regulatory side, the medical side, could you comment on that?","Jay T. Flatley","Sure. Well right now it's a sub-hundred million dollar business for us. But it's a very rapidly growing part of our business and one where we're beginning to apply more resources, as I described, with what we're doing in TCG business. We think that there are a number of different things we need to do to be successful in diagnostics. Clearly, we need to modify, to some extent, the way our products are configured. Many clinical customers want the technology to change more slowly than our customers do in the research market to have better live tracking, to have better built-in reporting into the systems, to have increased ease-of-use and greater degrees of integration. These are all directions we're taking our overall product development pipeline. The other factors, of course, we needed to be involved with is the regulatory side and the reimbursement side. We've built up a regulatory team inside the company, a very competent team. And this has given us the ability now to put our platform through the FDA, which we think is a critical step to allow third parties to put their assays onto the system and get them through the FDA, so we're quite confident there. The billing and reimbursement is an area that we've not yet made a big investment in but we probably will over the next year or 2, and that could be either organically or through a potential acquisition.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jay, how should we think about the GAs in the field at this point? I guess, is there or will there be a program to get folks from the GA to the 2500?","Jay T. Flatley","There is now. So we offer -- we've continued to offer trade-in value for the Genome Analyzers. We don't think everyone is going to trade them in the next 12 months, but we're encouraging our customers to make that step-up to the 2000 or the 2500. Yes, and the other factor, of course, is that some customers may want to trade out the GA for a MiSeq, depending upon what vintage GA they have, they may want to use a MiSeq rather than a Genome Analyzer.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Are you placing GAs at this point, or is that pretty much through at this stage?","Jay T. Flatley","No, it's pretty close to end of life for us. I mean, we're doing some remanufacturing of GAs, but we're not building new ones. And so I think over -- certainly in 2012, we will begin to end of life that product in terms of manufacturing. Clearly, we'll continue to support it in the field for a long period of time going forward. But as you appropriately questioned at the beginning, the incentive for us is to get those customers onto our newer platforms if at all possible.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure, okay. and I guess does the speed in the throughput that we'll probably see with the 2500 make submission of that platform to the FDA something that makes strategic sense at this point, or is that probably just going to be better served through either the MiSeq or some of the later stage products?","Jay T. Flatley","I think it certainly could be. It will depend, to some extent, on how we see the customer demand evolving. If we begin to have a material number of customers coming to us saying they want to get FDA approved assays running on a 2500, then we would be incentivized to take that product through. Because that wasn't built from the very beginning with full design control, it would be a little bit more difficult for us to do it, we'd have to go back and do some remediation of the design control documents. And so it'd be a bit more costly, but certainly if customer demand is sufficient, we're prepared to do it.","Operator","We'll go next to Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could offer some more color around the guidance assumptions for 2012, be it instruments versus consumables, arrays versus sequencing and\/or price volume and mixed assumptions on the consumable side?","Jay T. Flatley","Christian, do you want to take that?","Christian O. Henry","Sure. When we look at the guidance for the year, what we were thinking about is a return to sequential growth like we saw in the fourth quarter. And so we think the revenues will grow over time over the course of the quarters. Of course we've got new products coming out in the second half of the year with the 2500 ramping and the MiSeq improvements ramping. We expect consumable revenue to keep growing as the sequencing install base improves and also the use per system improves slightly. We saw that improvement in the fourth quarter over the third quarter. People have largely gotten back to work as Jay pointed out, and I think that we see some opportunity there. Of course there's still the backdrop of funding in the second half of the year. That's still a bit uncertain, but right now we feel pretty good about the numbers that we've put out there going into the year, and we're happy to get back on track with providing guidance. And right now, our focus is let's get the first quarter out of the way and keep moving through the year.","Jay T. Flatley","And we're not really prepared to give guidance to any greater level of granularity than what we provided.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. And for my follow-up question. Christian, the first quarter guidance, I'm wondering why you wouldn't assume a bigger sequential revenue growth, given that your book-to-bill in Q4 was 1.2 if they're offset by [indiscernible] thinking about.","Christian O. Henry","Yes, well we're still -- if you think about -- we did have a very strong order quarter, there's no doubt about that. And typically, those orders will be shipped over the first half of the year, more of them in the first quarter than the second, of course. But we're still constrained with respect to MiSeq manufacturing capacity and also on the array side, for example, the exome product we've scaled up dramatically. Our order flow was much, much more than we ever anticipated, yet we're still a little bit constrained there. So we gave the guidance in considering those factors, as well as basically Q1 is typically the lowest order quarter of the year. And so those 3 things put together kind of gets you in that 250 to 260 range.","Operator","We'll go next to Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","Jay, just with the Roche bid, has this changed the strategic outlook perhaps to accelerate product commercialization or the way the sales force is selling?","Jay T. Flatley","No. I think obviously as part of the evaluation of the offer, we looked very hard again at our strategic plan, and it was frankly quite timely because our strategic planning cycle ends in the month of January. So we work on this every year and so the plan was fresh. We reviewed that with our board and there were no specific changes to strategic plan that came out of any considerations having to do with the Roche offer. So as I mentioned, it's business as usual. We're focused on executing our strategies, and we believe that the plan is a good one and that we will execute well against it.","Christian O. Henry","Of course we'll start the 2013 strategic plan in another few months.","Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","And then for guidance, what does that incorporate for improving end markets or any unchanged end market, how are you looking at that?","Christian O. Henry","Well we probably won't give that level of granularity, but as Jay pointed out in his remarks, we see the funding -- we see the funding environment still has some challenges, probably in the back half of this year. But overall, it's improved a little bit from where we were in Q3. And so we've taken that into consideration. And we've also taken into consideration the fact that our revenue is starting to shift to more commercially-oriented customers. We saw that over the course of the year. And in the fourth quarter, it was -- what was it, Marc, about 26% of our revenue was derived from commercially-oriented customers. And so this is a really important indication that new funding sources are going to come into the market as our products move deeper and deeper into clinical applications. And that should give us, obviously, opportunities to grow, but also opportunities to reduce or dampen some of the volatility that NIH-type funding swings might cause.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I think the conclusion there is that we took as balanced an approach as we could. We thought about the increasing commercial penetration that Christian talked about, the emergence of these diagnostics market, the continuing growth, the install base of sequencers building up the potential reagent flow. And of course, took into consideration the risks associated with the funding environment, which we think is particularly acute in the U.S., less so in Europe and Asia. And in fact, Asia has performed quite strongly for us here over the last couple of quarters, and from a shipment perspective was extremely strong in Q4.","Operator","We'll go next to Sung Ji Nam with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Jay, first of all, given in light of the 2500 launch, I know you guys had capabilities to increase the throughput on the 2000 to over one terra basis, and so is that currently shelved given that there is insufficient demand for that kind of throughput in the market? Or could you maybe comment on that?","Jay T. Flatley","We're constantly pushing the technology in all different directions, overall output per run, the length of the runs, the accuracy of the overall sequencing result. And what we decide to ultimately deploy to the market is based on what we think the market needs are at any given point in time.","And based on what we saw with D3[ph] and the feedback we've gotten from our customers, to be honest, the next step in improvement that they're after isn't an increase in overall output, it's a decrease in the overall runtime. And that's why we focused this next product on pushing that dimension of the system rather than the overall output. But your presumption is correct that we certainly have the ability to increase the overall output when we think that's appropriate for the marketplace.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess to the extent possible, could you comment on kind of what your expectations are for the growth potential for the company, the top line growth potential. In a more normalized environment, you guys have posted, obviously, very strong double-digit growth over the last several years. This year you're guiding to 4% to 11%, which is the lowest we've seen coming from you guys. And then you talked about the future market opportunities, which I would say from a penetration standpoint sounds conservative, but if you look at the total market you're talking about a $63 billion market opportunity. And just kind of curious as to where do you expect the funding to come from? Is it coming from the therapeutics market to a large extent? Or it just seems pretty aggressive compared to the current IDD market globally.","Jay T. Flatley","I'm sorry, what part's aggressive compared to the...","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","In terms of the future market opportunities coming from newborns as well as cancer testing. And then just if you could comment on kind of the more normalized environment, what the top line growth potential could be in the near term, in the next 2 to 3 years?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, well we haven't renewed our long-term guidance, and we haven't done that yet because there are remaining uncertainties and you've seen the guidance we put out for this year reflecting the continued cautiousness surrounding the global funding environment. And we think that's an appropriate place to be. Having said that, we think overall this market is a strong double-digit grower. We think these new market opportunities are going to be absolutely enormous. We put a 1% penetration on those markets as I think you did, you put a 10% penetration in there, you're looking at $6 billion of opportunity. In particular, the cancer market has the prospects of taking off quite quickly. And we think we're within a year or 2 of dramatic inflection point in cancer. And if any one of these markets begins to take hold, I think you'll see a rapid acceleration of sequencing penetration and growth into those markets. And presuming we remain a leader, which we're absolutely committed to doing, that could strike very high growth rates against the company.","Operator","We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Great. Jay, I guess my big question is kind of just an industry question for all the participants. How are you thinking about pricing? I mean, it's hard for me to imagine a researcher or someone looking at their budget today, willing to spend $500,000 to $700,000 for an instrument again and spend as much as $5,000, $6,000 per Genome again, at least in kind of their outlook for things, given all the products that you and others have announced. Maybe you can talk about what your anticipation is from a pricing perspective?","Jay T. Flatley","Sure. Well, I mean, I think this market's been fueled for a decade at least by the fact that there is enormous elasticity in the sequencing market. And so we've in fact driven prices down historically in this marketplace and we think we'll continue to be extremely competitive there. The question really becomes one of where is that elasticity in each of the different market segments? And we think we're about to break open new markets in cancer as we talked about just a couple of minutes ago. And as we get down toward $1,000 Genome, we think that, that opportunity is going to break wide open and generate enormous revenue, and revenue, obviously, greater than the loss from the pricing changes. With respect to the instrument pricing, we're continuing to sell HiSeqs at very high prices, and the 2500 offers unique capabilities and there is no other technology in the marketplace that can do what our technology can. We can fast-forward a year or 18 months and talk about the world then that may be a little bit different and perhaps it will, perhaps it won't. But we're prepared to be fully competitive whenever it gets there.","Operator","Our last question will be from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So based on the detail you guys provided today on the pipeline and adjacent markets, you clearly recognize that the fact was, this is what you're going to have to do to convince current shareholders of the gross inadequacy of the Roche offer. But clearly, in the past, you've had a desire to almost be Apple-like in really being really protective of disclosing anything in terms of product development until you're essentially ready to roll out a product. Moving forward, how do you envision managing this, and do you now think you actually have to go even further in disclosing more detail on things like single molecule and the diagnostic opportunity area, thinking about another R&D day. We're just trying to think about how you're going to manage this moving forward, which clearly today you're demonstrating is going to be different from what you've done in the past.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I mean we have talked a bit, Doug, about some new stuff and we think it's exciting technology to talk about. But I would suggest to you that we've talked only about a very small part of our portfolio that's coming. And there's lots more behind this. And so we may choose to disclose a bit more about this, but I think we continue to be Apple-esque as you put it, in terms of the conservatism we have with preannouncing products or things that we haven't done before. So we make sure that anything we announce we've done, that it's robust, that it's working and that it's ready to go into a commercial deployment sort of pattern. And I think you'll continue to see us behave exactly that way in the future.","Operator","And at this time I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Williams.","Kevin Williams","As a reminder, a replay of this call will be available as a webcast in the Investors section of our website, as well as through the dial-in instructions contained in today's earnings release.

","With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.","Francis deSouza","Thank you, Jacquie. Good afternoon everyone. Illumina had a solid end to 2019 with fourth quarter revenue of $953 million, up 10% from the fourth quarter of 2018. Highlights included 22% year-over-year sequencing consumable growth and stronger than expected IVD partnership and non-DTC array revenue. This more than offset softer sequencing system revenue and weaker than expected DTC revenue. While some variation of mix should always be expected in our dynamic industry, we are pleased to have delivered higher than expected revenue in the fourth quarter.","For 2019, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion, up 6% and in line with the guidance we set in July of last year. We shipped more than 2,400 sequencing systems, the most in Illumina's history. We achieved our 2019 NovaSeq goal with approximately 320 shipments, slightly higher than 2018. Total sequencing consumable revenue grew 14%, and surpassed $2 billion for the first time, including more than $1 billion of high-throughput sequencing consumables, and total data generated by Illumina sequencers increased 50%, highlighting the rapidly growing demand for genomic information.","Back to the fourth quarter, NovaSeq consumable pull-through was at its highest level of the year and indeed the highest since the platform was launched, driven in part by the UK Biobank, which is now operating at scale. We shipped more than 100 NovaSeq systems in the fourth quarter. As we expected, this was more than twice the number we shipped in the first quarter of 2019.","NovaSeq pull-through per system for 2019 was approximately $1.2 million. And looking forward, we are targeting a pull-through range of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per NovaSeq system in 2020.","As we enter NovaSeq's fourth year, HiSeq consumables continue to decline as expected, and were below $100 million in the fourth quarter for the first time since the NovaSeq launch. At the end of the year, we completed a review of our HiSeq customer list, indicating an active HiSeq installed base of approximately 1,300. This review identified approximately 600 currently inactive HiSeq systems that had previously been included in our installed base. Outside of this review, there were approximately 200 decommissions reported to Illumina in 2019.","Moving to mid-throughput, NextSeq delivered a record number of shipments in 2019 and now has a global installed base of about 3,600. Fourth quarter NextSeq shipments were lower than expected due to customer timing. Demand for NextSeqDx continues to grow, and represented almost a quarter of 2019 shipments, up from approximately 10% last year.","It was a record quarter for NextSeq sequencing consumable revenue, driven once again by oncology and NIPT. NextSeq pull-through per system improved from last quarter and was at the lower end of the $130,000 to $160,000 target range. With the launch of our new NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 systems, we will update our target pull-through range when we have a sizeable installed base of the new systems.","We expect to ship approximately 500 NextSeq 1000s and 2000s this year. While most NextSeq 550 prospects will transition to the new systems, we expect the NextSeqDx pipeline to remain strong, given the unique positioning of our regulatory approved system. We are looking forward to shipping the first NextSeq 2000s later this quarter and are very pleased to announce that we have already received our first orders.","Moving to low throughput, system revenue was below our expectations in the fourth quarter, primarily due to MiniSeq. Demand for MiSeqDx continues to exceed our expectations with particular strength in China where the system was cleared by the China NMPA in August of 2018. Earlier this month, the MiSeqDx was approved by the PMDA in Japan, which we expect to contribute to placements in 2020.","Turning to low throughput consumables, it was a record revenue quarter. MiSeq consumable pull through grew closer to our target range of $40,000 to $45,000, and MiniSeq pull through was at the low end of the $20,000 to $25,000 range.","Back to sequencing consumables, total revenue of $2.1 billion grew 14% or over $250 million in 2019. Just over 40% of our sequencing consumable shipments were for clinical, which includes testing for oncology, reproductive health, and genetic disease and other.","In total, clinical sequencing consumables grew about 20% or approximately $130 million in 2019 to approximately $830 million. Oncology continues to represent about 20% of total sequencing consumables and grew faster than total clinical consumables in 2019 due to increased adoption of panels including Comprehensive Genomic Profiling. As more tests like FoundationOne CDx and Guardant360 receive coverage as companion diagnostics, demand for Illumina sequencing continues to grow.","Additionally, clinical trials, like Guardant\u2019s LUNAR, drive increased sequencing consumable utilization in oncology testing. Reproductive health once again represented a little more than 10% of sequencing consumables, primarily reflecting continued growth in NIPT due to broader coverage in EMEA, where our VeriSeq NIPT solution had 80% sample volume growth, and growing adoption in China. Reproductive health continues to grow in the U.S., at a more modest rate compared to EMEA and China.","Finally, within clinical, almost 10% of our sequencing consumable revenue is related to genetic disease testing, which grew slightly below the clinical average. Growth is driven by companies like Centogene, which has built a genomic repository of over 450,000 patients from over 125 countries and is working to help diagnose patients\u2019 genetic disease and collaborating with pharma partners to find cures. It also includes a portion of revenue from genetic testing companies like Ambry, who offer tests tailored toward genetic disease diagnosis among other clinical tests. ","Turning to research and applied, shipments of over $1.2 billion represented just under 60% of our sequencing consumable shipments. As a group, research grew over 10% in 2019 driven by genetic disease and cancer. Genetic disease research includes population genomics initiatives such as the UK Biobank and the Million Veteran Program.","Cancer research was also a strong contributor to growth and includes projects like the cloud initiative at St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital. The St. Jude team is building a database to access whole genomes of 10,000 pediatric patients and survivors, helping researchers to gain valuable insights into the genetic causes of pediatric cancer.","Other research categories include Cell and Molecular Biology Research, Microbiology, and Infectious Disease Testing. This includes projects like J-GRID, the Japan Initiative for Global Research Network on Infectious Disease, which is a collaboration between nine countries in Asia and Africa, and utilizes Illumina sequencing to research microbial diseases.","Moving to sequencing services and other, revenue of $124 million was up 19% from the same quarter a year ago, largely driven by upfront revenue from the Roche deal, partially offset by GeL which declined, as expected, to almost zero in the fourth quarter of 2019 ahead of the clinical ramp-up later this year.","And finally, arrays delivered revenue of $116 million, down 12% from the same quarter in 2018 due to continued headwinds from our direct-to-consumer customers, offset in part by array growth in genetic disease research.","Before I hand the call over to Sam, I\u2019d like to comment on the novel coronavirus outbreak. Our immediate focus has been our colleagues in China, and our thoughts are with the families and communities impacted. Over the last few weeks, Illumina has been engaged in a number of ways to help manage the coronavirus outbreak. Scientists have already used Illumina sequencers to identify and publish the genomic profile of the coronavirus into the public databases, which is a critical first step to enable the development of diagnostic tests and ultimately potential vaccines.","Our team is actively working with Chinese CDC labs to prepare Coronavirus NGS Testing Protocols and provide the necessary training. We are also working with our supply chain team to ensure that systems and consumables are delivered to labs working with novel coronavirus as quickly as possible. We plan to share these NGS testing protocols with customers to support the global infectious disease community as it mobilizes to address this threat. Further, we\u2019re exploring philanthropic programs and collaborations to ensure novel coronavirus sequencing is available by providing sequencing and consumables to those who need it to fight this epidemic.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Sam.","Sam Samad","Thanks, Francis. As discussed, fourth quarter revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $953 million, driven by 14% growth in sequencing, offset by a 12% decline in microarrays. Total sequencing revenue of $837 million grew 14% from the fourth quarter of 2018 and represented 88% of total revenue compared to 85% in the same quarter last year. Sequencing consumable revenue of $572 million grew 22% or over $100 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, while sequencing system revenue was down slightly sequentially and down 12% compared to last year.","With regards to sequencing systems, we are reviewing installed base counts to proactively identify the active systems. We have completed the work for HiSeq, and are now reviewing NextSeq, MiSeq and MiniSeq. We will revise those installed bases in the next quarter or two as we complete the analysis. Importantly, this does not change the reported revenue in any way. However, we do expect system counts to decrease, while the pull-through per system will therefore increase.","Sequencing service and other revenue of $124 million was down $14 million sequentially due to lower IVD licensing and milestone revenue and lower GeL volumes in the fourth quarter, but up 19% year-over-year. Fourth quarter results included an upfront payment associated with the recently announced Roche partnership. Arrays represented 12% of total revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to 15% in the fourth quarter of 2018 and to 16% in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Array systems were up $2 million sequentially, but down $5 million from a particularly strong fourth quarter of 2018. Array consumables grew $18 million sequentially due to DTC seasonality with one customer ramping ahead of the holiday season, but were modestly down from the same quarter last year. Array services were down $6 million sequentially and down $8 million or 32% year-over-year due to lower demand from our DTC customer.","Moving to regional results, Americas revenue grew 5% versus the prior year quarter with growth in sequencing consumables and IVD partnership revenue, partially offset by DTC headwinds. EMEA delivered a record revenue quarter with 19% growth from the prior year quarter, including a strong contribution from the UK Biobank, which is now sequencing in full production mode. Greater China grew 21% from prior year quarter, with an easy year-over-year comp associated with tariff-related stocking in China in the fourth quarter of 2018. The region grew 2% in 2019, with slower research offsetting very strong growth in clinical. Finally, APJ revenue of $73 million was up 4% from the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by genetic disease research and microbiology driving sequencing consumable growth both sequentially and year-over-year. For the full year, the region grew 6%.","Moving to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight non-GAAP results that include stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today\u2019s release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 70.2% was roughly in line with expectations and decreased approximately 230 basis points compared to the third quarter, with lower IVD licensing and development revenue, in addition to variances in production and lab service absorption partially offset by product mix. Year-over-year, fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin increased over 100 basis points primarily due to product mix and higher IVD licensing and development revenue, partially offset by lower DTC service volumes.","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $372 million were up $42 million from the third quarter of 2019, largely reflecting the timing of OpEx spend weighted towards the end of the year and were better than expected. Non-GAAP operating margin was therefore 31%, down from 36.1% last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 18.5% was up from last quarter and higher than expected due to income mix in various tax jurisdictions. For the fourth quarter of 2019, GAAP net income was $239 million or $1.61 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income was $252 million or $1.70 per diluted share.","Moving to cash flow and balance sheet items. Cash flow from operations was $443 million, helped in part by a $58 million sequential decline in inventory. This is part of an initiative, led by our Operations and Supply Chain organizations, to optimize our working capital.","DSO of 55 days compared to 54 days last quarter. Fourth quarter capital expenditures were $57 million and free cash flow was $386 million. And we repurchased $63 million of stock in the fourth quarter, leaving $226 million available for share repurchases under our current plan. We ended the year with approximately $3.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter was 148 million.","Moving to guidance, we expect full year 2020 revenue to grow in the range of 9% to 11% or $3.86 billion to $3.93 billion representing an increase of approximately $354 million at the midpoint. Given the new system launch, and ongoing weakness in DTC, we are expecting revenue linearity to be similar to 2017, which suggests just below 22% of revenue in Q1, approximately 24% in Q2, approximately 26% in Q3, and approximately 28% in Q4.","For the full year 2020 and at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, we expect sequencing revenue to grow approximately 14%. This includes sequencing consumable growth around 17%. And we expect sequencing system revenue to grow year-over-year reflecting our NextSeq 2000 and NextSeq 1000 launch more than offsetting the expected step down in NovaSeq shipments.","And we also expect sequencing service and other to be roughly flat year-over-year. We expect array revenue to be down approximately 15% reflecting ongoing weakness in DTC. Note that DTC revenue represented approximately 50% of total array revenue in 2018 and decreased to about 40% in 2019. For 2020, we expect DTC to represent approximately 30%.","From a regional perspective we expect China to grow in the high teens, driven by clinical sequencing. We expect full year non-GAAP gross margin to be roughly in line with 2019. We expect operating margin to be approximately 30%; and we expect the 2020 tax rate to be higher than full year 2019 due to a number of one-time discrete tax benefits in 2019 that are not expected to repeat in 2020.","We therefore expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.45 to $6.65, and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $6.80 to $7. And we expect diluted shares outstanding in 2020 to be about flat compared to Q4 2019.","Note that, following the termination of the Pacific BioSciences merger agreement earlier this month, Illumina paid a $98 million reverse termination fee to PacBio. Additionally, Illumina will pay $34 million in continuation advances that may be repayable to Illumina if PacBio enters a change of control agreement or raises at least $100 million within a given timeframe. The impact of these payments is not reflected in our EPS guidance, pending the valuation of these amounts this quarter.","Moving to the first quarter of 2020. We expect total revenue to be between $850 million and $855 million as customers consider and adjust their plans following our NextSeq 2000 launch. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to increase approximately 600 basis points as a percentage of revenue on a sequential basis primarily due to our bonus accrual reset at the start of the year. And we expect the first quarter non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.20 and $1.25, and GAAP EPS to be $1.11 to $1.16.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Francis.","Francis deSouza","Thank you, Sam. We\u2019re off to a strong start in 2020. The UK Biobank is sequencing at scale, and we are contracted with GEL to provide sequencing services starting in the middle of the year, significantly strengthening our popgen visibility relative to where we were a year ago.","We launched our most innovative system to date with the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000. The system offers the highest cluster density flow cell of any NGS system, driving down the cost per gigabase for mid-throughput users. And we succeeded in our ambitious target to fully integrate the hardware-accelerated, best-in-class pipeline that we acquired with Edico just 18 months ago.","We\u2019re excited about our TruSight Software Suite, a potentially transformative solution that simplifies genetic disease diagnoses and reduces barriers to adoption. I look forward to sharing updates on it after launch.","We continue to extend our clinical portfolio, and both TSO 500 and TruSight NIPT are progressing through regulatory. And we are expanding our capabilities through partnerships with the world\u2019s leading clinical companies, including Qiagen, Roche, and Adaptive, to deliver the most compelling IVD menu available on our clinical-grade sequencing systems.","As our customers discover more biological insights by sequencing at greater depths and volumes across new and emerging applications, the growing clinical utility of genomic information is becoming increasingly clear. This, coupled with growing community awareness and physician adoption, will enable more patients to benefit from the promise of genomics.","With that, I\u2019ll invite the operator, to start the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. I\u2019ll try to ask just a couple of quick ones up front. On the fourth quarter, can you quantify the Roche milestone? It looks like the partnership fees stepped up $15 million to $20 million. So was that all Roche in the fourth quarter? And then looking ahead on instruments, coming off 4Q where you relied on instrument revenues, are you doing anything different in terms of NovaSeq pricing to try to catalyze the remainder of the HiSeq upgrade cycle? It looked like NovaSeq ASPs did decline a bit in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s the first question.","And then on NextSeq, just curious as you think about that, is it an upgrade cycle to the installed base or market expansion as those two new systems get rolled out into the market? Thanks.","Sam Samad","Yes, thanks Tycho. So this is Sam. On the Roche milestone, we didn\u2019t quantify that. It did come in better than expected, so the sequencing and another line came in better than expected in Q4, I would say, approximately $20 million or so better than expected in terms of sequencing and other. But we didn\u2019t quantify exactly how much of that was Roche. You can think about it as IVD revenues that we had in Q4 that the majority of which was driven by Roche.","With regards to your second question, so I\u2019ll take that one and then Francis can comment on NextSeq. With regards to your second question around the ASP on NovaSeq, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re doing anything special around reducing the ASP or giving \u2013 reducing the price or giving any discounts to customers. What we \u2013 this is natural and driven by multiunit orders that we have across 2019 as well, you can look at it at the UK Biobank, a number of placements that we have with the UK Biobank that usually have a lower ASP. We\u2019ve had some NovaSeq placements in emerging markets which also have a lower ASP. So, it\u2019s natural dynamics there when you place multiunit orders with some of our customers, but nothing specific on lowering the price across the board.","Francis deSouza","Thanks, Sam. Hi, Tycho. In terms of the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 target base that we\u2019re going after, we are already focusing, as you pointed out this to be an upgrade cycle for customers of the NextSeq 550 today. That\u2019s where we expect the bulk of the demand to come from for the NextSeq 2000 launches this quarter and then the NextSeq 1000 launches later in the year. We also expect a smaller bolus of orders to come from some MiSeq customers. We highlighted a couple of quarters ago that we expect \u2013 that we\u2019re starting to see MiSeq customers that are migrating up and buying bigger instruments, we expect those customers to be looking at the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000.","And so that\u2019s where we expect the bulk of the customers to come from. There\u2019s a chance that there might be a small number of HiSeq customers that look at the NextSeq 2000, but that\u2019s likely to be a very small number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is open.","Dan Brennan","Great, thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted a little more color on kind of NovaSeqs, the center you\u2019re talking about placements being down in 2020. Can you give us some help on how much of the install base you expect to kind of have upgraded by the end of the year and kind of any more color on the level of it being down?","And then secondly, just related to HiSeq consumables since you are kind of giving more granularity there? What\u2019s kind of baked in within your consumable guidance by HiSeq consumables in 2020?","Francis deSouza","All right, so if we look at the NovaSeq upgrade cycle, so here\u2019s how the numbers are playing out. We believe that under half of the HiSeq, HiSeq X customer base has started the NovaSeq transition. And so we still have over half of that install base to go. That\u2019s going to play out between now and 2024 when we end of life the HiSeqs. And so that\u2019s the numbers we expect to happen.","In terms of the number of NovaSeqs, last year was a very strong year in terms of NovaSeq placements, which is something we\u2019re really excited about, especially given that it\u2019s the third year of the NovaSeq upgrade cycle. We expect that number to come down this year quite naturally, and we expect that to play out similarly over the next couple of years.","Sam Samad","And with regards to HiSeq, Dan, we\u2019re not giving specific information on the level of consumables or what to expect even in terms of pull through. We\u2019ve backed away from giving pull through ranges on HiSeq and total consumables. What we\u2019ve mentioned for Q4, as you heard on the prepared remarks was that consumables for HiSeq were less than a $100 million in the quarter, they continue to come down, obviously the expectation, I think, intuitively as you would expect in 2020 that HiSeq consumables will continue to come down, but we haven\u2019t given specifics on what that dollar number is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, good afternoon. And thanks for the time here. I want to ask one on China and one on the NextSeq launch. As it relates to China, I appreciate that you\u2019ve given a view dating back to a few weeks ago that there\u2019s an expectation for some recovery of growth in China. I wonder if you could speak to the balance of what you\u2019re seeing there between funding dynamics \u2013 as opposed to maybe just easier comps. And then of course the broader question that we have now around the environment given the viral outbreak to what extent that is or is not a factor that one considers.","And then secondarily, now that we\u2019re a few weeks into, and I appreciate that still early, the NextSeq launch, how are your higher throughput customers who might also be NovaSeq buyers or owners? How are they thinking about using this system? Is it fair to say that we were comfortable with the trajectory on NovaSeq orders being largely unimpacted by the NextSeq given as a pretty attractive price per G dynamics on the P3 flow cell? Thanks.","Sam Samad","Yes, so thanks Steve. I\u2019ll start with the China question and then I\u2019ll get to the NextSeq question. In terms of China and what we\u2019re looking for, we saw good growth from China in Q4 a little of it was based on a friendly year-on-year comp, but we are seeing growth and we knew that would be lumpy. In terms of this year, we are expecting, as we said, growth in China that\u2019s going to be primarily driven from the clinical markets and more specifically oncology continues to be a very strong area for us in China. And we expect that to continue to play out this year.","In terms of the coronavirus, I\u2019ll say first and foremost, our thoughts are with the families and communities that are impacted by the virus and are one of one of our top priorities to make sure we\u2019re doing everything we can to help and making sure that our teams stay safe. In terms of the financial impact of that it\u2019s too early to call the financial impact either in Q1 or for the year. And as we get more clarity, as this plays out, we\u2019ll certainly communicate transparently with investors. As we thought through the impact it\u2019s possible that if the epidemic grows and if patients start to avoid going to hospitals, there could be an impact to NIPT and cancer testing in China. But it\u2019s way too early to call that impact. So we\u2019re going to continue to watch that situation. And again, we\u2019ll communicate with you what we see. We are deeply engaged in working on the coronavirus. We have teams working on that around the world with the Chinese CDC teams, as well as CDC teams around the world.","And then in terms of the NextSeq launch and how are our high throughput customers, especially some of the legacy HiSeq customers thinking about it. So as I said, we really expect the NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 to appeal to existing NextSeq customers. That\u2019s going to be the bolus of the upgrade cycle. There\u2019s going to be some interest from MiSeq customers that are upgrading and a little interest from existing high throughput customers, but not much. The reason for that is if you look at the output of the NovaSeq and you look at the output of the NextSeq, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve tried to cover the ground, but there\u2019s very little overlap.","So at the very high end if you go through the \u2013 if you go with the high output flow cell of the NextSeq 2000, you can get to an output of 300 gigabases. And at the low end of the NovaSeq with the prime flow cells, you can get a 500 gigabases of output. And so there\u2019s a clear gap there. And so you can \u2013 you self identify. And most of our high throughput customers, we think will go with the smaller flow cell on the NovaSeq and the NextSeq 2000 and NextSeq 1000 will continue to appeal to that mid throughput customer base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.","Bill Quirk","Great. Thanks and good afternoon everybody. So quickly thinking about the clinical oncology growth of the next couple of years, there\u2019s several very innovative noninvasive screening option as well as our current monitoring test coming online. How should we think about the business overall trending relative to 2019 did a possibly inflect back to the \u2013 I think, it was 30% maybe year or two ago. And then separately, on coronavirus, are there any analogous situations to other outbreaks, things like, MERS, for example. And if so, have you study the impact on what happens, say, in the middle of the east region to your business during that outbreak and taking to look at that relative to coronavirus. Thanks, guys.","Francis deSouza","Thank you, Bill. So I\u2019ll first talk about the clinical oncology market, specifically, touching on the potential impacts of the screening opportunity and emerging monitoring opportunities on the growth rate. And then I will talk about the coronavirus. So in terms of clinical oncology testing, today, the bulk of the revenue that we get from clinical oncology and the bulk of the growth, frankly, is coming from customers that are using NGS based testing, various types of panels for therapy selection.","And so that sort of the bulk of the revenue that we\u2019re see in clinical oncology, that\u2019s the most penetrated part of the clinical oncology market. But frankly, it\u2019s still at its early stages. It\u2019s still about 8% penetrated. As we look at the other areas in clinical oncology, we see really exciting opportunities and potentially much larger opportunities coming from monitoring and screening.","Both of them are in the very, very, very nascent stages, customers like Guardant and GRAIL and Phenom are doing some really exciting work there. The monitoring opportunity is starting to play out maybe a little bit further along than the screening opportunity today, where we\u2019re seeing the early use of liquid biopsies to monitor the effectiveness of a therapy to look for MRD and for recurrence of a cancer.","And so their customers like Guardant are starting to sell tests into that space. Again, very early stage, we\u2019re starting to see revenue from it and when we think this represents a potential large growth opportunity for us in the future years. Screening is a little bit earlier, again, super nascent, but hugely exciting. I don\u2019t know, if you\u2019ve had a chance to look at the results that companies like Phenom and GRAIL have been publishing over the last few months at ASCO and ESMO.","But the GRAIL results for example, show that they are able to \u2013 in those studies have very low false positive rates. So their numbers indicate maybe less than 0.5% false positive rates and high levels of specificity or over 20 different types of cancer. So they\u2019re still in the study stage, they\u2019re talking about having a test maybe end of this year, sometime next year. Obviously, that represents a very meaningful market opportunity in terms of impact on human life and represents a very big opportunity in terms of revenue for those companies and also for Illumina. But that\u2019s something that\u2019ll play out, not much this year, but in future years.","If you think about coronavirus and how that\u2019s playing out. And we looked at MERS played out and SARS played out. And it\u2019s a little bit different because the market is a little bit further ahead in terms of the state of the art NGS testing.","The way this will play out, we think is that NGS will play a number of critical roles and combating this coronavirus outbreak. While we believe first line testing of patients will be done with RTPCR, NGS will be used in a number of specific ways. One, we\u2019ve already seen it play out where NGS will be used to initially sequence the virus and create the publicly available reference needed to help develop diagnostics and then ultimately cures.","So we started to see that play out already with coronavirus and we saw that previously with SARS. And yes, we\u2019ll also be used to confirm the strength in patients. It\u2019ll be used for detecting novel mutations in the viral genome. We saw that in other outbreaks, not just MERS and SARS that we saw that with Ebola. And then also, it will be used for immunological surveillance, which will be very important in terms of tracking this outbreak.","And then finally, we expect NGS to also be used as last resort testing, patients with inconclusive tests. So for example, when a patient presents with suspicious symptoms, but the RTPCR tests are negative for coronavirus. And also for other viruses with similar symptoms like influenza, then we expect in NGS test to be used.","And that\u2019s our point of view based on what we\u2019ve seen with previous outbreaks. As I said earlier, our teams around the world are currently engaged and have been working, for example, in China with the CDC teams in December and we\u2019re working with CDC teams around the world now. We\u2019re also engaged with philanthropic organizations and collaborations to make sure that NGS testing is available globally to monitor this outbreak.","Sam Samad","And Bill, maybe to emphasize a couple of data points on the clinical business and oncology as well back to your initial question. So for 2019, for our comments earlier, our sequencing consumables in terms of clinical grew by approximately 20% and oncology \u2013 in terms of oncology, sequencing consumables grew above that, so over 20%. And when we look at also our top customers in oncology, they grew also above that average \u2013 above the oncology average, so just some data points around the oncology in clinical growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Derik De Bruin","Hi. Good afternoon. Hey, a couple of questions. The first one, can you talk a little bit more about the HiSeq decommissions. I\u2019m sort of surprised by the number and just sort of talk about the labs that are not using it. Are those customers now outsourcing more? Or did they buy NextSeq for something else and that sort of like leads into the next question, which is surprised to see that the NovaSeq consumable guide for 2020 was about $1.1 million to $1.2 million per box. So I\u2019m just wondering, if your HiSeq customer are \u2013 and those instruments are coming down, I\u2019m just surprised why that Novaseq number isn\u2019t higher than it is.","Sam Samad","All right. So thank you, Derik. Let me start with the HiSeq decommissioning number. So that\u2019s the result of a focus we\u2019re putting on getting closer to our customers getting more visibility into how our customers are using the instrument. And so we spent some time really looking to the instruments, which instruments are active, which instruments are not active. So it\u2019s a new model for us understanding, what instruments are being used out in the field.","So the total number 800 isn\u2019t what got decommissioned last year. So that\u2019s about 200. The total number is sort of a catch out to say, okay, of all the instruments we have out in the field. How are they\u2019ve been used, which ones are being used a lot, which ones are being used less? And what we came down to is just about 800 that we feel are largely inactive.","It doesn\u2019t change anything in terms of the revenue we\u2019re getting from HiSeq to consumable, what it does mean is that, there are fewer active instruments in the field and the ones that our customers have using actually are being utilized more than the previous model had estimated and that pull-through per instrument at those labs is actually higher than the old model had estimated. So those customers aren\u2019t doing anything different, they aren\u2019t outsourcing more, they still have both the active and inactive instruments that when we looked at it, they were using some instruments more.","And so that the dynamic of how it plays out. In terms of your second question, Derik, with regards to NovaSeq, so yes, our guide for 2020 is $1.1 million to $1.2 million pull-through per instrument. We\u2019re very pleased in 2019 with the performance that we see in terms of the pull-through on NovaSeq as we mention that was $1.2 million for the year was a record quarter in Q4.","Our expectation now in the fourth year of launch in 2020, because as we start seeing some of those lower throughput customers convert and move over and even newer customers that are using NovaSeq with the S Prime and the S1 flow cell. You will start to see lower throughput from those customers impacting the average. That\u2019s natural in the fourth year of launch for the instrument. But that\u2019s the driver for the $1.1 million to $1.2 million pull-through guide.","Francis deSouza","In addition to Sam pointed out some of the smaller customers we expect to come online this year and part of the reason for the guide we gave. There will be an offsetting influence happening as you see some of these large popgen customers continue to sequence like the UK Biobank that\u2019s really running, that\u2019s really running in full force, as well as NHS commissioning coming online. And so that will be the offsetting factor that\u2019ll play on this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Your line is open.","Dan Arias","Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the questions. Apologies for a little bit of a cold here. But Francis on the NextSeq, can you just talk to the rationale for the launch of the 1,000 unit in the context of just thinking back to the Nova 6000 and 5000. Back then it seemed like customers that upgraded really wanted the higher capacity option and to not have to wait around to acquire it. So I guess I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m curious about the way in which you see this being different. And then maybe relatedly, anything more specific you can say to the P3 flow cell launch later this year, in terms of timing, I\u2019m curious about how much we should expect demand for that configuration to be captured in 2020. Thanks.","Francis deSouza","Sure. And I hope your cold gets better soon. I will answer the NextSeq question first. So why do the 1000 if we expect the majority of customers to buy the 2000, and then I\u2019ll talk about P3. So the strategy of having, the higher and lower end instruments is one that we\u2019ve used many, many times. So you pointed out with the NovaSeq 5000, 6000, we have the HiSeq 3000, 4,000. We have a HiSeq 2000, 2500. And what this allows our sales teams to do is it allows us to start the conversation with customers that are lower price point.","And some customers do buy the lower instrument, but as you pointed out, what happens in that conversation is the vast majority of cases they end up buying the higher priced instrument. And that played out in everyone of those instances, I talked about going back a decade, right. But it\u2019s important for our reps to be able to have that lower priced instrument, so they can start the conversation. And that\u2019s been the strategy.","In terms of the P3 flow cell, the way we set this to play out is that the customers for the first couple of full quarters of NextSeq 2000 are going to be excited about the fact that they can buy a flow cell who\u2019s output is comparable to today\u2019s NextSeq. So they can make \u2013 they can compare the new machine on an equivalent output using equivalent workflows from the old machine to the new machine.","But we do expect that a lot of our NextSeq customers are going to buy the instrument with an eye to their future business and will be very attracted by the higher output and the economics associated with the P3. In terms of timing, we said, we expect that to come towards the end of the year. Obviously though it's public now and the specs of that flow cell are public now. So it's something that customers know about we\u2019ve been planned for.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","Hey, good afternoon. So just a couple of things on NovaSeq. First, just looking back, regarding guidance for consumable pull-through per box of $1.1 million to $1.2 million per Nova. How does that compare to 2019? And I guess, the reduction in HiSeq consumable revenue below $100 million, which is a little bit below where I think you guys have been tracking the last few quarters. I'm just wondering if that's indicative of larger programs on HiSeq access being largely completed at this point and some of those large customers with those projects now increasingly moving over to Nova. So those are the looking back topics I'd like to cover.","And then looking ahead, is the assumption that NovaSeq placements are lower in 2020 versus 2019 a function of trying to hedge for the potential that there's some Nova cannibalization? A function of reducing the number of HiSeq\u2019s that are out there to replace. So maybe having a little bit more visibility on what the replacement outlook is. A function of being in year for the rollout or maybe just a little bit of all of the above. And finally, is there anything structural that would prevent you from implementing the blue-green chemistry on a higher end platform like NovaSeq or actually on a NovaSeq in the future? Thank you.","Sam Samad","Thanks, Doug for the question. So I'll start with the first one and I'll transition to Francis for the second and third. With regards to NovaSeq, so for the full year 2019, we communicated that pull-through is $1.2 million per instrument. And going forward, we expect it to be in 2020 $1.1 million to $1.2 million. So essentially, the high end of the range in equivalent to what we saw in 2019.","And with regard to your question on HiSeq, I think it's exactly right. As we get deeper into this upgrade cycle, as we get deeper into this cycle where customers are transitioning from HiSeq to NovaSeq as some of this work transitions over and completes on HiSeq and moves over to the new instrument. You do expect to see consumables come down on HiSeq, which is what we've indicated is that we expect in 2020 to continue to see HiSeq consumables come down and obviously, NovaSeq consumable stay free.","Francis deSouza","And then Doug you asked about a couple of other things. One, in terms NovaSeq placements, why are we expecting that to be lower this year, given that we've had two back to back very strong years of NovaSeq placements? Is it being influenced, you asked, by NextSeq and cannibalization there? And then you asked is there a structural reason or any structural reason why the blue-green chemistry couldn't in the future be implemented on NovaSeq?","So in terms of NovaSeq placements, as we looked at this year, the work we see to be done this year in terms of the NovaSeq upgrade cycle is to really go after the smaller core labs, right. So that's the upgrade cycle that got activated last year with S Prime, with S1 and then S2\u2019s new pricing. And so as we look at the pipeline this year, we expect it to be a lot more full of the onesies twosies with the small core labs.","And so that's the dynamic we expect to be playing out in our customer base and in our sales teams. And so that will result in a total number that's smaller than some of the big multiunit purchases you saw last year in Q3, Q4 with customers like the UK Biobank for example. So instead of doing 10 units placements, we expect more deals to be one to two units. And that's frankly the biggest driver in terms of the placement number being down this year compared to last year.","We don't expect much cannibalization between the NextSeq and the and the NovaSeq. They target very different price points, both in terms of capital but also in terms of costs per g and there's no overlap in terms of the output. And so when you add those three variables together, it's very easy for customers to self select. If you have the sample volume to allow you to go purchase a NovaSeq, you will always do that because you get superior economics. And even with the new NextSeq 2000 running the P3 flow cell, you still get superior economics on the NovaSeq if you have the sample volume. And if you don't have the sample volume, it will never cost in so you to go to a NovaSeq. So there's very little overlap in terms of the segments that are targeting. So there maybe some, but we don't expect much.","And then your question about structural reason, why we can\u2019t use the blue-green chemistry, NovaSeq, but frankly anywhere. And the answer is there isn't any. We view that as a core architectural component in our toolkit now. As we do other elements of things you saw in NovaSeq, for example, the hardware acceleration toolkit that we built into NextSeq 1000 and 2000 based on the Edico technology, that's also another core architectural component.","And there's no reason why that can\u2019t show up in any of our future instruments both up and down the portfolio. What will decide whether it does show up frankly, is the design point for the next instrument we put out. And if we have something better in the toolkit, and that's always sort of an active debate internally. So at any given point, we'll pick the best components we have the design print we\u2019re going, but there's absolutely no structural reason as you point out, why those components couldn't show up in a future version of a high throughput instrument or a lower throughput instrument.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Leerink. Your line is open.","Puneet Souda","Yes. Hi, Francis. Thanks. So my first question is, I was hoping to get a better view into the NHS clinical ramp and the level of visibility you have there. You made comments around clinical samples ramping in second half of this year. This is one of the largest project, if not the largest. And I appreciate that you were expecting 300,000 to 500,000 patients sequenced by 2025 target. How do we bridge that to the 5 million potential genomes that NHS had laid out earlier. And what should we expect in the second half this year?","And on NextSeq, I completely get your comments around 2000 uptake. Our checks are suggesting the same among academic customers, smaller labs. But I just wanted to understand, in terms of those that have diagnostic instruments or instruments in diagnostic settings NextSeq\u2019s and MiSeq\u2019s, what's your expectation for those customers to upgrade given the new chemistry, given that these instruments are validated and some of them are using NextSeq Dx? Any thoughts on NextSeq 2000 Dx? Appreciate it. Thank you.","Sam Samad","Sure. Thank you, Puneet. So I've got three questions. One is, give you an update on the NHS ramp and how that's looking for the back half of the year. And then also comment on how to bridge the fact that we've talked about 300,000 to 500,000 samples, whereas you have Secretary Hancock talking about 5 million genomes being done, so bridge that. You also asked about NextSeq and that upgrade cycle, especially talking about the Dx instruments. And whether the Dx customers for NextSeq will be part of this upgrade cycle.","So in terms of the NHS, we are happy with how things are progressing, frankly. Since over the last few months, we've given you the update announced at JPMorgan that we have signed a contract with GeL to provide the lab testing services, the genomic lab testing services for the NHS. Our teams are deeply engaged. We hosted a leadership here in California to review plans going forward. So as of now we feel very good about how things are tracking in terms of the ramp for the NHS. So we expect to see that sort of midyear going forward.","The first phase is 300,000 scaling up to 500,000 genomes to be sequenced. And we've done a bottoms up analysis that team on how you get there. And what we've said publicly is that, genomic testing is going to be a standard of care for just over 20 genetic diseases and four different types of cancers, starting the middle of the year when we ramp up with the NHS. So standard of care for the UK population, 55 million to 60 million people.","But obviously there are a lot more than 20 genetic diseases and a lot more than four cancers. And so Secretary, Hancock is really driving the NHS to be more ambitious about how we want to roll this out for the entire UK population. There are not 20 genetic diseases there are 6,000 genetic diseases and they\u2019re awfully lot more than four cancers.","And so as you start to do the buildup of what happens when you expand this across cancer indications, and across more genetic diseases, as well as other areas that genomic testing could be helpful for better outcomes at lower costs, that\u2019s how you get to a number like five million. That\u2019s not yet a committed path with a committed timeframe, but that\u2019s the ambition. So that\u2019s the NHS ramp.","In terms of NextSeq and the upgrade path especially around DX, the way we expect the DX market to play out is that if you are a NextSeq DX customer today or you are in the pipeline to buy a NextSeq DX, we expect that you will either keep using the one you have or you will buy a new NextSeq DX. And that more likely than not, you won\u2019t be purchasing the 2000 or the 1000 right now. And that goes to the point you made, which is look you have validated workflows in a lot of cases, you may actually have a cleared assay built on our cleared box. And so you\u2019ll certainly keep an eye out for when the 1000 and 2000 DX instrument gets announced and comes to market.","But for the foreseeable future, your capacity adds will be DX boxes, NextSeq DX boxes. And so we don\u2019t expect those customers to be driving the pipeline for NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Your line is open.","Patrick Donnelly","Thanks, guys. Sam, maybe just on the guidance linearity you talked about maybe just a bit more color there. 1Q obviously came kind of well below where the Street was only looking for 1% of growth on the revenue side, EPS pretty big year-over-year decline. So can you just talk through that a bit more?","And then on top of that on the guidance side, the full year visibility into some of the PopSeq revenues timing of some of those initiatives that have yet to start. Obviously in 2019, we saw some push outs. Let me just talk to the confidence level and the numbers, particularly that 200,000 from UK Biobank. How much can we see that shift, either upside or downside from that number? Thanks.","Sam Samad","Sure. When we think about the Q1, and thanks for the question by the way, Patrick. When we think about the Q1 number, I mean, first of all, as we look across Q1, but also across all of 2020, this is not unlike other years where we\u2019ve had instruments launches. So going back to 2017, I know NovaSeq is a different instrument, but the linearity is very similar to what we saw in 2017. ","And when we think about Q1 if you\u2019re looking, if you\u2019re comparing versus Q4, obviously you have two or three big factors that drive the decline from Q4 into Q2. One is seasonality and the lower instrument placements, specifically NovaSeq in Q1 versus Q4, seasonality across most of the business across sequencing consumables as well. And then what we also have seen in the past where Q1 usually is a big step up because of the DTC business and some of the processing of samples that come back after the holidays, well that doesn\u2019t exist this year because we have obviously a very much weaker DTC performance for both Q1 and the year.","And then finally another key factor is the fact that with the launch of NextSeq 2000 you will have constrained NextSeq shipments in Q1 because customers are pausing, waiting for the new instruments to come out and the new instruments will not be available until late in Q1. So you will have much fewer NextSeq shipments overall in Q1. So those are the key factors that drive the sequential decline from Q4 into Q1.","As we think about the rest of the year, obviously you will have the NextSeq 2000 launch that continues to ramp up. You have instrument placements for NovaSeq will ramp up across the year. You will have the population genomics opportunities that we talked about. So the UK Biobank is in full production mode and will continue to process and continue to process those 200,000 samples that we talked about across the full year. But then you have also the expectations that we shared at JPMorgan around all of us starting in the middle of the year, the NHS commissioning with GeL starting in the middle of the year.","So we have obviously confidence with the ramp that we expect over the course of 2020, but Q1 is constrained for the reasons that I mentioned. And obviously the NextSeq 2000 launch plays a big part in that, but it\u2019s not unlike other launch years that we\u2019ve had before.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. Just wanted to circle back on those PopSeq expectations. So Sam or Francis, how comprehensive is that disclosure meeting the three programs you flagged, the UK Biobank, All of Us and NHS, are those the three you\u2019ve gotten permission to offer some disclosure and there could be other ones that are material coming into the fold in 2020 or are those really the three that are going to drive numbers in 2020?","Sam Samad","Maybe I\u2019ll start and Francis can chime in as well. So this is not about what we have permission to disclose. This is about we want to make sure we focus on the key PopGen projects and those three are the key PopGen projects that we talked about last year and we wanted to talk about this year and provide very specific visibility to them. So UK Biobank, which has started and we will continue to process all across all of 2020, All of Us, which was big talking points in 2019 and we want it to get clarity as to when we expect that to start and the number of samples associated with it. And obviously the NHS commissioning project, which was also a talking point last year. And now we\u2019re pleased to say that we have this agreement with GeL and the NHS and that\u2019s going to start as well.","And the UK Biobank has started too. There are other population genomics initiatives within our 2020 financials. We will not be specifically talking about those. Those are part of our business. Some of those have started in 2019, some of them we expect to start in 2020, but we really wanted to focus on the three key material ones.","Dan Leonard","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes \u2013 your final question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jack Meehan","Thank you. Good afternoon. Just maybe a round out, I was hoping, following the conclusion of the PacBio, potential deal. I was just hoping you could give us an update on Illumina\u2019s strategy in long-read sequencing. It seems like Illumina is going to need to innovate their way into that market. So maybe just what\u2019s the strategy moving forward? How big of a priority is this in terms of R&D? And can you maybe give us some comfort around the level of prioritization versus some of the other things you\u2019re working on like clinical? Thanks.","Francis deSouza","Yes, sure. Let me let me answer that Jack. So, we continue to believe that the long-read market will be an adjacent market in the overall sequencing market representing about 5% of the overall sequencing market and that for the foreseeable future the two markets will intersect very little, to be honest. The big markets for us, whether it\u2019s oncology testing or NIPT don\u2019t really need the long-read capability and the big markets for long-read de novo sequencing, new species sequencing really need that long-read capability and so short-reads aren\u2019t a suited technology for that market. So we continue to believe that will be a complimentary market to the short-read market representing about 5% of the overall sequencing market.","What we were excited about in the PacBio deal was that our engineering teams are fantastic at driving the price, the cost of a machine down we have terrific at engineering and operations teams and terrific technologists. And what we wanted to do is try and accelerate that market because we know that there is a knock on effect about what\u2019s good for that market is good for our market, because once you sequence a new species, for example, you do the bulk sequencing in that species on short-read technology.","And so, we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to move that market more quickly than it is moving now. But it\u2019s a small part of the overall sequencing market. It dwarfs in comparison to the clinical market opportunity, which is much, much larger than the long-read market opportunities. So in terms of tradeoffs that we would do internally, it\u2019s not even close when we think about spending more to drive the oncology testing market forward, for example, versus the long-read market.","Having said that, we\u2019ve been public about the fact that we have our own long-read programs that we\u2019re working on internally, we\u2019re going to continue to work on those internally. But far and away, the higher priority for us continues to be, the short-read core markets, both the research markets and the clinical markets.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Flatley","Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. Q1 was an extraordinary quarter for Illumina. Our business continued to accelerate, delivering orders substantially above our plan, with strong underlying trends across all geographies.","Revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $331 million, which was not only the sixth quarter of sequential growth, but also a record for quarterly revenue.","Total micro-array revenue increased 1% year-over-year, due to a combination of BlueGnome, strong instrument shipments and a robust quarter in genotyping services.","Additionally, we saw a sequential increase in both sample volume and orders. Our outlook for arrays is generally as expected, with customer interest remaining high in our standard micro-array products, including Infinium OmniExpress Exome, Core Exome and the Omni2.5 products. In fact, we set a record for whole genome association, with approximately 300,000 samples shipped in the quarter.","Additionally, our iSelect genotyping products are doing well across many customer types, including consumer customers. Our consumer array business appears to have hit a pricing sweet spot, leading to significant market elasticity. This resulted in a large order during the quarter, which is deliverable over several years.","Turning to our sequencing business. Total sequencing revenue grew 32% year-over-year to more than $235 million. This substantial growth was a result of increased demand for consumables, sequencing services and HiSeq instruments. In fact, during the first quarter, sequencing consumables grew more than 40% compared to Q1 of last year, as a result of our larger install base, higher utilization per instrument and share gains in our Sample Prep business.","Our Sample Prep kits continue to demonstrate robust year-over-year growth, as more customers switch from competitor's products or homebrew. Our Nextera kits drove a significant portion of the growth, along with demand from TruSight kits from commercial customers. New product introductions, specifically the Nextera Rapid Capture Exome Kit, which enables the fastest exome enrichment workflow, have been positively received.","Since launched in Q1, a large genome center has switched from a competitor's exome enrichment platform to our new exome kit and many other customers are beginning to adopt this accelerated workflow.","Shipments of our TruSeq targeted RNA kits will begin this month. These kits offer highly customizable gene expression profiling and will serve as a technology alternative in the mid-plex realtime PCR market, which we estimate to be approximately $300 million in size.","The sequencing instrument revenue increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2012, as we saw a resurgence in HiSeq instrument sales, including unit shipment levels above those seen in the fourth quarter of 2011. We attribute this demand to acquisition of new customers, as well as capacity constraints in our install base.","In the first quarter, more than 40% of HiSeq shipments were to first-time HiSeq users including a large order from a Japanese pharmaceutical company and the Tohoku Genome Center. Additionally, capacity constraints are being felt by academic and translational customers given the increasing demand for sequencing, as the cost per data point comes down.","We're committed to accelerating the adoption of sequencing through continued improvements to our SBS chemistry. One example of this is the recently announced product roadmap for the HiSeq 2500, which will provide the ability to sequence up to 300 g in approximately 60 hours. We remain on track to launch this reagent and software enhancement in the second half of 2013.","Importantly, this product enhancement does not take advantage of our recently announced ordered array technology, which will further improve system performance, as we deploy it in particular kits.","Demand for HiSeq 2500 upgrades is further evidence of the value proposition we're providing to our customers. Approximately, 20% of the installed base has now been upgraded and feedback continues to be very positive, siting improved accuracy and queue flexibility. We expect to ultimately upgrade around 35% of the existing HiSeq install base by year end.","As expected, MiSeq orders were modestly lower sequentially, given the particularly strong Q4 results, but normalizing for the exceptional Q4. This quarter, MiSeq orders continued to demonstrate the steady quarterly growth that we've become accustomed to in the first 3 quarters of 2012.","MiSeq ASPs were stable, compared to the prior quarter, despite the new 15 for 15 program, which offers a discount on the instrument when bundled with the purchase of 15 consumable kits. This program is intended to help our customers initiate their sequencing projects more quickly.","Interest in the MiSeq platform remains high and our competitive position is incredibly strong. Feedback from our sales force points to stable competitive dynamics, with MiSeq still winning over 80% of head-to-head competitions.","Increased adoption is being seen for applications outside of core research, including a multiunit ordering in Q1 from the U.K.'s Health Protection Agency, which is now part of Public Health England. We're focused on expanding our commercial reach this year, with 50 additional sales reps, which we're in the early stages of hiring.","With this investment and our strong competitive position, we're confident in our ability to broaden our geographic reach, while building awareness in peripheral markets like microbiology and food safety.","Today, both our MiSeq and HiSeq platforms are enabled to stream data to BaseSpace. More than 30,000 sequencing runs have been submitted by customers to BaseSpace, providing us with an invaluable resource to assess realtime instrument and reagent performance.","Today, we have approximately 6,000 registered users and many researchers are sharing data across their research centers, a capability that greatly enhances the customer experience. The next major update to BaseSpace will roll out in Q2 and include an e-commerce capability, allowing the purchase of apps in our BaseSpace store.","Given the rapid adoption of BaseSpace and positive feedback on this groundbreaking cloud solution, we believe we're building a foundation for a powerful committee of collaboration for life science researchers and eventually clinicians.","Our FastTrack Services business achieved record shipments in the first quarter. We shipped more than 4,000 genomes, a 60% sequential increase, and also recognized a significant milestone by surpassing our 10,000th genome shipped.","We continue to gain momentum in sequencing services. We're pleased to be the sequencing subcontractor on the initial award for the VA Million Veteran Program, where we will be working with Personalis to sequence and genotype more than 1,000 veterans.","The fundamentals of this business are strong and we're in discussions on a number of large population-based studies, but we would like to remind everyone that service revenue can fluctuate significantly based on the timing of project completions.","Importantly, part of this momentum is coming from shorter turnaround times for our FastTrack Services and in this quarter, we completed a project of more than 1,000 genomes in just 12 weeks. We recently added 2 new partners to the Illumina Genome Network: the Peking University Nova Gene in Beijing, China; and the HudsonAlpha Institute in Alabama, which is already accepting customer projects.","In our clinical business, we continue to see strong demand from nontraditional customers looking to employ NexGen sequencing technology and in Q1, close to half of the HiSeq orders were to commercial, clinical and translational customers.","Sessions at recent conferences, including HEBT, ACMG and AACR, point to increasing evidence that rapid progress is being made to adopt NGS sequencing in clinical settings.","Illumina remains the clinical partner of choice, given that only our instruments can accurately and efficiently sequence panels of genes, whole exomes or whole genomes, flexibility customers are seeking in the clinical market.","At AACR, we announced the release of our TruSight Tumor content sets and already have seen a number of customers, including Clarient and Ambry Genetics, adopt the panel for use in sematic variation, detection in tumors. We remain incredibly passionate about accelerating the adoption of NexGen sequencing in the clinic.","We continue to push forward on our reproductive health strategy. Our MiSeqDx system and cystic fibrosis full gene sequencing assay submissions are currently being reviewed by the FDA.","During the first quarter, we also submitted our Infinium Dx CytoSNP-12 assay and iScan Dx array scanner for 510(k) clearance. These products are intended to be used as an aid in the postnatal diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders, developmental delay and intellectual disability.","Bolstering our efforts in carrier screening and cytogenetics are products from our acquisitions of BlueGnome and Verinata Health, which specializes in preimplantation screening for in vitro fertilization and prenatal testing, respectively.","Through internal development and acquisitions, we now possess a broad portfolio of diagnostic platforms and methods, a solid foundation to accomplish our goal of leading the genetic revolution in reproductive health.","The acquisition of Verinata closed in late February and we're pleased with the initial integration progress. While it's very early in the life cycle of the verify test, we're seeing significant growth in demand, assisted in part by our distribution partnership with PerkinElmer. Today, we're not prepared to share with you the run rate of testing, but are pleased that volumes have met or even slightly exceeded our expectations.","Last week, Verinata announced that the verifi test is now available to Aetna members. This announcement, which was aided by the relationship between PerkinElmer and Aetna, makes the verifi test assessable to Aetna's approximately 20 million covered lives. Additionally, through our distribution agreement with PerkinElmer, we're in active discussions with other payers to expand verifi coverage.","In future quarters, we hope to share with you our strategy for working with the FDA to bring the market in IVD, noninvasive prenatal test and also our plans for working with other NIPT customers. We're in the early stages of developing our IVD application approach, including the level of data required and timelines for submitting the test for regulatory approval. We believe an IVD test will significantly expand the global market and enable all test providers to be successful in this field.","We've also completed an in-depth study of alternative scenarios for working with our existing NIPT customers and are in the process of executing on that strategy. This is inherently delicate, will take some time to implement and, of course, may take a number of different paths, but we believe that our strategy remains sound and actual.","Before closing, a quick update on funding. The effects of the sequester on future buying patterns of our customers remains to be determined, but to date, we've not been impacted and our business remains robust. We continue to see significant interest in our platforms and ordering patterns from our academic and government customers are stable.","Several factors lead us to believe that this trend will likely continue. First, a number of NIH centers, including NHGRI, have been conservatively funding grants at 90% under the continuing resolution.","Second, NIH funding to sequencing base grants has also increased at a double-digit CAGR over the last few years, including a 4-year high for new sequencing-based grants in 2012.","Lastly, outside of the U.S., funding is steady, if not improving. In Europe, funding is expected to be stable, with a Horizon 2020 budget and Asian funding is improving modestly, as evidenced by the Japanese stimulus.","Overall, Q1 was an exceptional start to the year. We grew revenue year-over-year and sequentially, despite a strong Q4 and a historically soft Q1. Our order rates remained strong and our long-term strategies for continued technology leadership are driving forward. We remain dedicated to improving human health by unlocking the power of the genome and enabling our customers across multiple markets to do this ever more efficiently and economically. The sequencing market has enormous potential and we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on these opportunities.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc, who'll provide a detailed review of our first quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley","Thanks, Jay. As Jay mentioned, our positive momentum continued in Q1 and led to a number of new records, including record revenue and record sequencing consumable shipment. These results were due to strength seen across all of our geographic regions, generating revenue of $331 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year, which includes BlueGnome and Verinata.","Organic revenue grew 18% year-over-year as a result of impressive instrument sales, demand for whole genome sequencing services and sequencing consumables.","In Q1, shipments to the Americas grew 28% year-over-year and European shipments increased 16% over the same period. Shipments to APAC increased 21% year-over-year as a result of strength in Greater China and Japan. Shipments to Japan, more than doubled sequentially, despite the weakening yen, and benefited from the end of their fiscal year and the stimulus program.","Instrument revenue for the first quarter was $88 million, an increase of 11% compared to the first quarter of 2012, as both HiSeq and array instruments saw significant year-over-year growth.","MiSeq unit shipments increased year-over-year, but MiSeq revenue was down slightly. This was a result of ASPs being above list in Q1 of last year, due primarily to the premium pricing we received on units shipped to Japan.","Consumable revenue in the quarter was $205 million, an increase of 19% compared to the first quarter of 2012, primarily due to our growing installed base, higher demand for Sample Prep and sequencing consumables and BlueGnome. Consumable revenue represented 62% of total revenue, a slight decrease from 63% in the prior year period and prior quarter.","In Q1, the annual pull through per sequencing instrument within our projected ranges are 45k to 50k for MiSeq and 300k to 350k for HiSeq. As compared to Q1 of last year, HiSeq pull through per instrument increased significantly due to positive trends in Sample Prep and customer utilization.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services, instrument maintenance contracts and revenue from Verinata, doubled versus Q1 2012 to equal $35 million in the first quarter. This increase was driven by the significant number of genomes processed in the quarter, a strong quarter of micro-array services and the ongoing growth in our extended maintenance contracts associated with an increasing install base.","Turning now to gross margin operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude legal contingencies, non-cash stock compensation expense, expenses related to Roche's unsolicited tender offer and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release.","Our adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 69.2% as compared to 69% in the first quarter of 2012. Despite the impact of the lower consumable mix and acquisitions, gross margins were up slightly year-over-year due to operational efficiency.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $53 million or 16% of revenue compared to $48 million or 15.4% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase in R&D expense primarily due to headcount additions to support our robust pipeline of product and development, including technology we acquired with Moleculo, as well as 5 weeks of expense from Verinata.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter was $66 million, or 19.9% of revenue, compared to $62 million, also 19.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. The sequential increase was primarily due to the impact of Moleculo and Verinata. Adjusted operating margins was 33.3% compared to 33.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012, primarily due to the impact of higher gross margins.","Adjusted operating margins were lower in Q1, compared to the 35.1% reported in the first quarter of last year due to increased investment in R&D and SG&A to support our long-term growth, as well as acquisitions.","In the first quarter, we recognized approximately 500k of adjusted other income. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 27.5% compared to 34% in the first quarter of last year. The Q1 tax rate benefited from the recognition of the entire 2012 R&D tax credit. Excluding this and other items, our normalized tax rate for the quarter would've been 31.2%.","Non-GAAP net income was $63 million for the quarter and non-GAAP EPS was $0.46. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $48 million and $0.36, respectively, in the first quarter of 2012. We reported a GAAP net loss of $23 million or $0.18 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2013, compared to net income of $26 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the prior-year period.","Current period results include the charge of $107 million for the litigation associated with the Syntrix verdict, $1 million of which was recorded in COGS and $106 million of which was recorded in operating expenses.","This amount is higher than the $96 million assessed in the judgment due to a catch up estimate of royalties with BeadChip shipments through Q1 and pre-judgement interest of $1 million, which was accrued using the t-bill rate and is subject to court opinion.","We continue to believe that the Syntrix judgment has no merit and, therefore, we intend to pro forma out the impact of the royalty accrued during our appeal. Ongoing expenses related to Roche's unsolicited tender offer was $7 million and the charge from the relocation of our headquarters decreased to $800,000 for Q1.","During the quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $88 million. Capital expenditures were approximately $21 million, resulting in $66 million of free cash flow. DSO decreased to 58 days compared to 63 days last quarter, primarily due to more even shipments in the current quarter.","During the period, approximately 489,000 shares were repurchased for $25 million under our previously announced repurchase program, leaving slightly more than $140 million of authorization remaining. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Having moved to providing guidance largely on an annual basis, we will not be updating our full-year guidance today, given that we just completed the first quarter. However, I would like to provide a reminder of a few key variables to consider when modeling out the balance of 2013.","Firstly, we will get a full quarter on the Verinata dilution previously communicated. Secondly, operating expenses will ramp throughout the year as previously discussed. And finally, we will return to our normalized tax rate for the remainder of 2013.","In summary, we're incredible pleased with the trends of our business and our Q1 result. Our order intake and pipeline remains strong and our product development, clinical strategy and investments, both to expand our reach and build further infrastructure, are progressing as planned. We continue to be diligently focused on exemplary execution of our business strategy.","Thank you for your time. Operator, we'll now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In the prepared comments, you talked about 40% of the HiSeq shipments coming to first-time customers. Can you give us a little more sense of the mix there? I know you talked about the genome center in Japan, but can you just talk a little bit more about the customer ordering patterns?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, it's distributed among commercial customers, translational customers and sort of a nontraditional uses of HiSeq. Certainly, what's happening in the NIPT market was a factor. We had a number of systems that went into those types of customers. There are a number of companies that are working on various types of cancer diagnostics and we certainly have some shipments into that group of customers as well. We're not going to sort of parse it down to exactly how many into each bucket, but probably more than any quarter in recent memory, the HiSeq mix was higher fraction outside the academic centers and, I think, provided a large portion of the upside we saw for HiSeqs in the quarter.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Then, on the consumables side, did you guys have any demand pull forward in front of the previously announced price increases? Anything you can talk to on that front?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We think we certainly had some. Of course, that doesn't show up in our revenue in Q1. It only goes in as an order and, therefore, into our backlog to be shippable throughout the rest of the year. But we think that last year we had a similar situation where we had a number of customers pre-order on standing contracts and we had that again this year. I would point out that, for those who avoided the price increase last year by taking a standing contract, that last year's price increase gets incorporated this year. So by putting in a standing order, they avoid this year's price increase, but can't carry forward the one they missed from last year.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then one last one. Any update on kind of negotiations with BGI? And I guess on China, as well, you did the Kindstar deal. So any thoughts on that opportunity?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. Our contract -- our supply agreement contract with BGI has now expired. So that just happened recently. So we're very actively in negotiation with BGI for a renewal of that contract. Not finished yet, but we'll keep people posted if there's any material developments there that we feel need updating. They remain a very significant customer for us. Kindstar is a very interesting organization in China. It's a relatively young company, but funded well. Some interesting venture capitalist involved with Kindstar. And they have some very powerful rights, we think, to take technology that's been initially developed here in the United States through some partnerships and to market those diagnostic tests in China. They're very interested in expanding broadly across the Chinese market. And so I think working with them is a very important step forward for us.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","This was a very impressive quarter in many ways, especially for HiSeq in particular. Could you provide some detail on what the recent mix of 2500 versus 2000 placements has been and how the consumable pull through is trending on the different platforms?","Jay T. Flatley","I think on the 2500 side, I think about 2\/3 -- about 2\/3 of the business was in the 2500 configuration and about 1\/3 in 2000. So it mirrors what we expected. I think the -- we're seeing a real trend and I think the one we've talked about previously as being a bit surprising to us and that trend being how important fast turnaround times are for this customer base, particularly in clinical markets, in queue management as we mentioned in the script. And because customers now have had a taste of being able to get data back very quickly, I think we're seeing people sort of getting hooked on that, where they love having their data back in days rather than weeks. And so I think that's going to continue to drive that 2500 migration of the platforms. In terms of rate and consumption, we're not prepared today to break down the mix between those 2 instruments. At some point in the future, we might, but we're not planning to do that today. But you can see, overall, the numbers are pretty consistent with where we've been over the last several quarters, in terms of pull through. So the potential is higher on the 2500. Yes.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","It is higher on the 2500 just because of the pricing. Okay. And then...","Jay T. Flatley","And the effective turnaround time, Doug, is the -- sort of the amount of sequenced rate kit you use per unit time is faster on a 2500. And therefore, you could do more runs at higher average price and so it's a significantly higher number.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's all very helpful. And then there's a decent pick up in R&D spend in the quarter. I think this was planned, but, I guess, I was curious given how strong a revenue quarter you had, did you accelerate R&D spend in the quarter? Or again, was this as planned? And, I guess, separately, could you highlight some key areas of investment and when you would expect we will be able to learn a little bit more about the expected returns on this investment?","Jay T. Flatley","Sure. What you saw in the income statement was all planned. So there was nothing extraordinary in R&D outside of the fact that we made 2 acquisitions. So the numbers do include Moleculo and 5 weeks of the Verinata expenses rolled into that R&D number. So that certainly accounts for a portion of that increase. We are continuing to hire, particularly in the engineering part of R&D, as well as in bioinformatics, are 2 significant areas of hiring for us. And those resources are being applied across a broad spectrum of product development activities, including continued work on BaseSpace in future iterations of what we plan to do with BaseSpace, new platform development, as well as continuing to work on, over time, increase integration of our platforms to ease the sample prep burden.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So Marc, could you just clarify a little bit on the operating expense guidance? You're basically saying that you're going to see an increase going forward. Is that absolute dollar amount percentage of sales that you're talking about? I'm just trying to get a general run rate given -- do we view as a current -- do we increase off of here from the absolute dollar amount? Just a little bit of color, please.","Marc A. Stapley","Yes, I would say, Derik, both. It's the type of investments we talked about on our call last quarter investing in our infrastructure, adding a full quarter of Verinata, in particular, that will have an effect as well. So you should expect an uptick in both items and then our normal planned headcount adds to support the business. We talked about sales reach as well. We'll continue to drive that pretty hard in the second quarter.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And my guess is you wouldn't expect the large number of HiSeq orders' sales to -- that you had in Q1 to repeat in Q2, Q3?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I'd say the underlying strength of the business and the trends we're seeing are quite positive. Obviously, we're not prepared to predict what the incoming order rate is going to be this quarter, but I think the fundamentals of what we're seeing in the market and in the performance of the platform and the competitive strength we have here are good signs. And so, obviously, we think that, that business will continue to do well. HiSeq remains the flagship instrument in the entire universe of sequencing products and we expect that to continue to be the case for a long time.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Speaking of competition, did you see a pick up in order activity during the quarter, given that your main competitor was a little bit distracted?","Jay T. Flatley","We may have. It's a little hard to attribute any particular orders to that, Derik, so I guess I wouldn't claim that, that was exactly the cause. I think what we sense is that the competitive dynamics have been quite favorable for us, perhaps in part to distraction, I'm not sure about that part. But certainly, to the delays that have been sort of publicly out there on various competitive platforms, where the sort of promised performance enhancements have not happened on schedule. And I think that, probably more importantly, has been an impact on our incoming order rates and customers deciding that, if they need to buy a sequencer now, MiSeq is the platform to do it with.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just one final question. You had about $7 million in revenues in BlueGnome in Q4. Could you let us know what that -- did that -- I guess, did that increase on a sequential basis, did it go up this quarter?","Marc A. Stapley","We didn't break it down, Derik. But what we did say was we talked about the organic growth being 180 -- excuse me, being 18%. So you can back into it and get very close to that number.","Operator","Next question comes the line of Ross Muken from ISI.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess, on sort of the marketing, it seems like in general, you're sort of getting a disproportionate amount of the budget given some of the tightness we've heard from others. And so you talked about sort of the overall funding environment still being quite positive. So as you sort of think about areas where you're seeing within even your mix maybe incremental dollars and this is just on the base academic side sort of go after new experiments. Is it a mix of sort of you bring new product to the market that's growing your sort of wallet share, I guess, as a pie. Is it also same-store on some of the legacy reagents and consumables and some of the legacy sort of experiments or areas where you're seeing growth as well? I'm just trying to get a sense where the sort of the underlying, as everyone has to kind of reappropriate. It's clear you're getting the total dollar greater, but if you sort of dig down deeper, is it really same-store up on everything? Or is it sort of a mix of sort of up and down depending on where you look in the P&L?","Jay T. Flatley","I'd say it's a pretty broad mix, Ross. So certainly, on the legacy install base called same-store sales, if you will, very clearly, we've seen an uptick in utilization rate over the last 4 quarters. So what was sort of depressed a year ago, because people were cautious and maybe sort of moderating their projects, we've seen that certainly pick up. I think the fraction of the total dollar pie going to sequencing continues to be very, very favorable. I mean the growth rate we're seeing in those numbers is terrific. I think the application sequencing across a broader suite of experiments is another really important factor, particularly in markets like RNA. More and more customers were saying to us we're giving up arrays altogether, we're moving everything to sequencing for RNA-based experiments. We're starting to see these -- little more methylation activity, dramatic increase in work in the cancer field now from the large cancer institutes, as well as the academic centers. We're beginning to see uptake of the MiSeq product in forensic type applications, early on there still, so I think the market there is going to be much, much larger for us. But we're starting to get orders from that type of customer from customers in biology. So the market expansion phenomenon here, I think, is a very important underlying powerful factor for us.","Christian O. Henry","I think the other thing too, Jay, is we've really been focused on increasing our portfolio of Sample Prep products, for example. And so we're now are capturing more and more of the dollars every quarter. We had a really strong quarter in Sample Prep. We have our new exome product out that has been very well-received. And I think those are -- that's part of our strategy, to capture more of the total dollars within an account.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's super helpful, Chris. And that's sort of what I was trying to get at. On the NIPT side, I mean, obviously, you have a unique view of that market, having sort of an inherent product on your own, as well as being a supplier. I mean, obviously, we're seeing a very, almost hyperbolic sort of growth in volumes there. I mean, what have you sort of learned, just being able to have this unique set about the market and about the trajectory and how you sort of fit into that overall, since you sort of acquired the asset? And what could you sort of share about how it sort of made you think about maybe not immediate term, because I know you're not guiding to this year, but longer-term views on the potential AUM of that opportunity and how you kind of have a unique play on much of it?","Jay T. Flatley","I think I'd start by saying the uptick of this test in the NIPT space has been astonishing to watch. We've tracked this for quite some time through the earliest intellectual property filings through our work with our existing NIPT customers. And we had put a somewhat accelerated development chart around this, but it's moderated by sort of what we knew about how long it takes traditional diagnostic test and new diagnostic test to come in to the marketplace. And this has sort of exceeded our wildest expectations in terms of the uptake rate. And clearly, that has to do with the fact that its used, to some extent, as a screen up front of an existing test that is expensive and invasive. And clearly, the change in the guidelines, way earlier than we thought, was an important impact there, as is the pace of the reimbursement decisions we're seeing being made supporting NIPT. So I think all those factors have created, I guess, what you call the hyperbolic acceleration here and clearly, that was a key motivator for us to get more directly into the market altogether. As I've talked about in the script, one of the more important things for us to do to make sure this becomes a very broad worldwide market, where we can penetrate the more fragmented opportunities in Europe and in China in particular, is to get to an IVD-based product. And that will allow us to sell quite broadly into thousands of labs, literally, and directly into hospitals as well. And at that point, I think this business alone, the market size here is $1 billion plus and even at IVD pricing. And I think that's sort of the ultimate direction that this will tend to go. We do believe that there's probably going to continue to be an LDT market because some of these elements in these prenatal testing happen rarely. And so it would be quite difficult to do a large enough scale clinical trial to demonstrate statistical significance for some of those. So there may, for quite some time, be the coexistence of an LDT market and an IVD market and, in combination, we think, quite a large opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Amanda Murphy from William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So I had a few follow-ups on the consumable side, specifically for the HiSeqs. So if you think about the HiSeq install base, how should we think about average utilization? So it seems like you're seeing an increase in utilization. Is that something you're seeing across all the customers, whether it be someone who has a single HiSeq or multiple? And then just another question there in terms of the incremental buyers. So you mentioned some of the users are running into capacity issues. I'm just curious who that is because some of the genome centers, obviously, have been running at pretty high-capacity for some time. So curious who that Incremental buyer is of the HiSeq -- of the existing user base.","Jay T. Flatley","I mean, to be clear, the utilization comparisons we were making were to a year ago. If you look sequentially, HiSeq consumables per average installed instrument were in, roughly, the range as it's been for a couple of quarters, which is a number we're quite pleased with, to be honest. I think in terms of the profile of the customer base, what we very clearly seen is the large centers getting sort of refilled with projects. And so many of them have now come back and said, \"Wow, a year ago, we were running at some fraction of the capacity and now we're running full tilt.\" So clearly that it's biased, to some extent, to those larger centers. But I think because of the new application breath, we're seeing it in other places as well. Clearly, as in any large install base like this, there's going to be a distribution and so there's some customers who aren't using it very regularly. But I think on average, we're seeing it tick up across most of the installed base.","Marc A. Stapley","And Amanda, the other factor is the one Christian referenced a little bit earlier is taking share in Sample Prep, specifically over the last year, in particular. That's helping the utilization rate.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right. And then to that point on Sample Prep, what is -- do you have an estimate of where you're at in terms of market share and where you think -- obviously, the market is expanding as well, but curious how much more room you have there on the sample prep side?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I mean, we haven't quoted exact numbers there, but we do think we still have quite a bit of head room. The exome kit, the new exome kit is new and so far has made great progress. But long runway, I think, to continue to convert customers over to that version of the exome kit. And as you know, it's a pretty diverse market, lots of different kinds of Sample Prep go on. So it's a little hard for us to estimate market share, particularly, because a portion of the market is still doing homebrew and it's hard for us to get a handle on those. So it'd be probably not sufficiently accurate if we were to pick a number. So we probably avoid doing it.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And then just one more question on the MiSeq. So you had the pricing program in place and you talked about a bifurcation in the user base in terms of consumable usage. I know it's a bit early, but have you seen that program actually impact maybe not this quarter or Q1, but have you seen any evidence that it's impacting consumable usage at all, for the MiSeq?","Jay T. Flatley","You're talking about the 15 for 15 program?","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, exactly.","Jay T. Flatley","Too early to tell. What we do know is that we had quite a number of customers take us up on that program. And so that's a good early indicator, but it's too early for us to really tell if it's accelerated the movement of that initial bolus of MiSeq customers from sort of low output in the start up phases more rapidly towards a sort of standardized numbers on MiSeq. So it will probably take us another quarter or 2 to have visibility on it. We are going to extend the program through the end of the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to start off with a question, just on the clinical side. Could you help us think about how your business is breaking down between the noninvasive premium assessing customers versus labs that are just buying the instruments themselves and running some of your panels on that. Just be interested kind of more so on the latter part to the breakdown maybe between like a larger lab and small labs. Any color you can give kind of on the clinical update side.","Jay T. Flatley","Complicated answer, because we have multiple platforms here sort of convoluted with the multiple market segments. I guess, what I would say is that the NIPT market and the high-end part of the cancer market tend to be on HiSeqs. And that's a growing part of the HiSeq sales, although HiSeq still tend to be dominated by academic sales. And IPT needs that level of tags and so has a very high throughput type of market. For some of our larger cancer customers who are running large panels all exomes or whole genomes, they again would tend to use HiSeq because they want lots of data in the lowest price per base. Now on the flip side of that equation, we have customers who are doing the smaller panels. So if you were running a panel of 30 or 40 genes, MiSeq would be the more appropriate platform. And I think in terms of mix, we're seeing about a 50\/50 academic nonacademic mix of sales of the MiSeq platforms. And in the 50% that are nonacademic, I would say maybe 1\/2 to 2\/3 of those are doing clinical type applications. The others are in microbiology and forensics and other types of uses of the platform.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then, Jay, maybe on the pharma customer base, I think maybe last year I think you had kind of rolled out, or maybe a push on a new initiative there to kind of refocus on that customer base or maybe they were refocusing of you. Just kind of wondering, is that a customer base that is showing up more frequently today, utilizing the instruments, maybe to help them do more targeted drug discovery. Just kind of thinking about that, that customer. You mentioned the Japan pharma customer in this quarter. Just kind of wondering how we should be thinking about pharma.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, there's 3 parts to the pharma market as we think about it. There's the sale of instruments to pharma that are used in the traditional research activities, not for content discovery, but for helping to sort through drug targets, identify how to enrich patients into clinical trials, things like that. That's a good market for us. They don't tend to buy 5, 10, 20 units to do that type of work. They -- although the large Pharma companies will buy 1 or 2 for all of their labs around the world. So that's sort of what that part of the market looks like. For the more large scale whole genome sequencing pharma market, we tend to see that being outsourced. So we see that in that in form of service contracts, where they might want to do 100 to a few thousand whole human genomes and sometimes RNA associated with those genomes as well, often cancer related. The third part of the market, which I think is still an emerging opportunity in the near-term is probably more of a BD activity for us, as in companion diagnostic. So we really do sense that the whole thrust of companion diagnostics going forward is going to move during sequencing complete genes, 1 to maybe 20 genes. And that is going to become a very important emerging opportunity and we're in discussions with a large number of pharma companies about working with them on companion diagnostic programs to accomplish that goal.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On diagnostics, can you maybe give us an update on where the marginal investments are focused right now, if we just put aside the Verinata initiative for a moment and touch on the cancer opportunity specifically?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. A couple of different pieces in cancer. I mean, clearly, we're working with lots of partners around the globe in cancer and some of them want customized panels to run on their instrument. So we're doing that. We're working with sort of the large players in cancer customers, like Foundation Medicine who have a very large panel. And they're a very important partner for us, as we continue to push this technology into personalized medicine and actual diagnosis and treatment. And I think that on the MiSeq platform, in cancer, it tends to be the smaller panels, anywhere from sort of the 8 genes that are reimbursed or maybe 10 or 12 genes now that are reimbursed, up to panels of 20 to 40 genes. And those tend to be more MiSeq type applications.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then maybe just a follow-up on product specifics. I think last quarter, you touched a little bit on head-to-head market share performance relative to the other desktop platform. Wondering if you could maybe update us on how that's going. And then on Moleculo, any updates on how you guys are planning to commercialize that technology and, specifically, on kit development, how that's going?","Jay T. Flatley","Sure. In head-to-head competition, I think, if anything, our competitive position has increased to some extent. In the script, we quoted that we think, on a head-to-head basis, we're over 80% win rate. Very few situations where we're competing head-to-head and lose. I'm sort of feeling really good about that. I'll let Christian talk about Moleculo, since it's in his shop.","Christian O. Henry","Yes. And so with respect to Moleculo, we're -- our product development program is already underway. We're going to launch first in services, hopefully late this quarter, and then follow it up with a kit later this year. We think the services aspect of this is interesting because it will get more customers experienced with the workflow and the data and how to do the bioinformatics. And we've got a very aggressive schedule to put a kit together because we do think there's a pretty interesting opportunity to get long reads out into the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","First question is, I realize it's just first quarter and we want to be sufficiently cautious, but you guys have printed a pretty strong quarter and, obviously, annualizing, you're basically going to be at your 15% guidance target. And so I guess I'll throw the question out there, did you consider bumping up the numbers? I mean, it certainly sounds like several elements of the franchise are performing very well. Verinata's really yet to affect the numbers, et cetera.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, the consideration, Bill, that we had around guidance really comes back to our goal to try to solidify our hope of providing guidance on an annualized basis. And if we declare that that's really what we're trying to accomplish and then we update guidance every quarter, it sort of defeats the purpose of trying to get the annualized guidance. So that's really the reason that we made an important decision to not comment on guidance this quarter and wait until we feel like we need to do that.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Got it. And then just 2 more quick ones was for me. Jay, I think it is pretty small, but can you just remind us, what percent of HiSeqs had been upgraded as of the fourth quarter?","Jay T. Flatley","About 20% have actually been upgraded in our current projection -- 20%, right?","Rebecca Chambers","As of the fourth quarter.","Jay T. Flatley","In the fourth quarter. I'm sorry, is the fourth quarter, was your question?","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, as of the fourth quarter, right.","Rebecca Chambers","Less than 10%","Jay T. Flatley","Less than 10%. And now we're at 20%. I'm sorry, I thought you meant the end of Q1. I apologize. Our expectation is that we'll get to about 35% by the end of the year. That's our goal.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. Excellent. And then last question for me is, just given the -- I should say a previous expressed interest in, obviously, working with the other parties in the NIPT market around patents in IP. And such given the review that's going to -- the 540 from Sequenom was going to undergo. Is there any changes to your thoughts about how, I guess, this IP dialogue develops over the coming months and years?","Jay T. Flatley","Not yet. We've -- as I mentioned in the script, we have worked very hard on this over the past 6 or 8 weeks. We've done a very in-depth study of what we think is happening in the market and the dynamics both domestically and x U.S. We've put together what we think is a very reasonable approach to the marketplace. And we're in the process here, over the next month or 2, of beginning to roll that out with our existing NIPT customers. As I said, their response is unpredictable at this point, but we think we have a program that's a very rational one, given the strength of the intellectual property position we think we have.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Amit Bhalla.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to ask a question for Marc. Can you talk a little bit about the gross margin on a year-over-year basis. You had some pretty nice revenue growth, but 20 basis points of gross margin expansion, I know there are some services components there and some dilution, but can you just walk us through the gross margin on a year-over-year basis why there wasn't more of an expansion?","Marc A. Stapley","Yes. I mean, I think, really, the dilution of the acquisitions is 1 reason, Amit, in particular. Plus the HiSeq upgrades, when we've talked about those previously, the ones that we're doing, the ones that took us from 10% to 20% over the old promotional price of 50k per instrument, per upgrade, which is obviously dilutive. And then we had a good, good FastTrack Services performance in the quarter and FastTrack Services is always, as we said before, dilutive. So it's just a different geography on the P&L. So those are the main reasons. And then we have had some -- some operational efficiencies, as well, year-over-year that have helped drive the gross margin up despite some of those kind of headwinds.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I mean, Marc, also, the mix of consumables was up a little bit, which -- I mean, the mix of instrumentation versus consumables was up a little bit.","Marc A. Stapley","Yes, that's right. You're exactly right. Plus the arrays for implementation was pretty strong this quarter as well.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And can you put any numbers around some of those -- the headwinds on the gross margin, relatively, or in proportion to the impact?","Marc A. Stapley","You mean the headwinds going forward?","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","No. The headwinds year-over-year, like 1\/3 from dilution to deals, 1\/3 from HiSeq upgrades, or however you want to characterize it.","Marc A. Stapley","No, not really. It would be a little granular. I mean, the year-over-year improvement is relatively small, I would say. Those headwinds have been offset by -- largely by the operational improvement that we've been able to make over the last 12 months or so.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, Jay, just in the context of guidance and assumptions, as we move towards later parts of the year, what is the underlying assumption you have for how our labs are going to play out with respect to funding sequestration? What's the assumption there in the guidance?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, what we put in the guidance at the beginning of the year was a 2% to 4% impact from sequestration. We're sort of on the high-end of that in terms of what actually played out. But 1 offsetting factor is the fact that under the continuing resolution, much of the NIH allocation was at 90% of the grand amount. And so that has a potential small upside effect that could neutralize any of the downside effects from the sequestration number being a little bigger than what we had in our guidance. So I'd say from a guidance perspective we're sort of feeling neutral about it, but we're watching very carefully and we're interviewing our customers constantly to see what their thoughts are about it. And obviously you guys are doing the same thing. We received reports continually streaming in about how people are feeling about the impact of sequestration. But, I guess, the bottom line of all of that, for us, is that we would probably say that it's embedded in the guidance that we have out there today.","Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then just a quick one for Christian. On Moleculo, have you come to an idea of pricing, when it's kit-able?","Christian O. Henry","No. We haven't put any pricing together yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Jay, could you, maybe, just give us an update on the livestock market? I know that's a market you've talked about in the past. And I'm just -- maybe, anything you want to say about kind of how that market is trending and the opportunities that you see there?","Jay T. Flatley","I think it remains pretty strong. I mean, it's an evolving market. It began -- or when it began a few years back, probably 3 or 4 years back, it was a lot of front end sequencing and sort of medium complexity arrays that fell out of that. Then as we got more and more sequencing, it migrated toward running some very high complexity arrays to try to sort out which of the variance had impact on the sort of desirable traits of cattle. And now, I'd say it's probably moving directionally toward the lower complexity arrays as they understand more and more about what matters. And by low complexity I mean tens of thousands of markers as opposed to hundreds of thousands of markers. But overall, I think the market remains a very strong one for us. It's an international market, so we're getting lots of business from South America, from some rich geographies in Europe and, obviously, the United States continues to do well there.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","And on the -- just out of curiosity on those lower complexity arrays, any -- what are we talking about, or what are you learning in terms of price per sample that is kind of the right price to be thinking about there for that market to take on?","Jay T. Flatley","Is a typical pattern we see where as we go to these lower complexity arrays, the prices are going to want to be clearly sub $100, in some cases more like $50, but the potential volumes go way, way up, because you're getting increasingly into screening type applications. And as that happens, ultimately, you're going to be -- like we talked about in humans, you're going to be doing genotyping on every cow that's born and using that as a way to triage its future. And we're probably still a couple of years away from where that -- where we get to that, but I think it's clearly headed in that direction.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","And then if I could just follow up on, I think, your comments on MiSeq. Just to be clear, where your revenue was down, was that a year-over-year comment? Your revenues were down and was that including consumables? Or were you talking about just instrumentation? And then just to be clear on this 15 for 15, I think you said you were extending that through the second quarter. And just I'm thinking -- I'm just curious if I'm thinking about this correctly, but if you were providing a promotion where you said the ASPs were stable, but you're offering this 15 for 15 in a way as that everybody's thinking that maybe there wasn't as much demand for the product as you would have thought with that promotion?","Jay T. Flatley","So as year-over-year comparison on instruments -- and the 15 for 15 really doesn't have anything to do with demand for the product. If anything, I think it might accelerate demand. But it was really put in place as a strategy to try to accelerate the adoption or the actual production of applications by our customers. Because what we see, and this basically is a tremendous tool to do this, is a bimodal distribution of reagent use among our MiSeq customers. You have the large group of customers who are centered slightly above the average. You see a tail of people who use it all the time. And you see a cluster of customers who use it a lot more slowly or a lot less per week or per month. And if you dive into that group of customers, what you find is that most of them are the new customers. And so the conclusion is that it takes a while for customers to ramp up to begin to develop their applications, to get into the purchasing cycle of reagents. And so the goal of the 15 for 15 program is to make sure customers had reagents in their lab the day the instrument arrives, because this requires them to buy those reagents at the same time they buy the instruments so they have those reagents ready to run. We send in our application specialists, to use those reagents, to teach them how to run the instrument and begin development of the application faster. So that was the goal of that program. It's not a way to discount the instrument.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Got it. And just so I'm clear, on a year-over-year basis, when you said -- I know you're consumables in 1Q '12 are not high, but you were talking about instruments on a year-over-year basis for MiSeq?","Jay T. Flatley","That's right.","Operator","And our last question comes the line of Dan Arias from UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jay, I think you kind of alluded to it with Dan's question, but for the clinical crowd, at this point, is there a general number of genes where above it you tend to see a switchover from panels to full exome test? Is it that 40 to 50 gene range? Just trying to get a sense of how clear customers are rolling out their products there?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, it will depend a little bit on what type of user it is, right? If you had a system in a large reference lab, like a lab core, or a quest, they would tend to buy the higher instruments, higher capacity instruments because they would tend to get lots of samples in. And so, even for panels that are 50 or 100 genes, they could fill it up and run it on a relatively regular basis. If you were in a more regional side or a low throughput kind of environment, then you'd clearly be in MiSeq land because you might not be getting hundreds of samples a day and so you wouldn't be able to fill up the instrument and yet you want to send back the results relatively quickly. And so it depends both on the number of genes, but there's that other dimension of how many samples arrive at the lab every day.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then on the service side, with what you're seeing in the FastTrack business and also the clinical growth, is there starting to become a need for high coverage, say, like a 100x service offering there as the clinical grade outsourcing sort of kicks in a bit?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, for cancer, in particular. In general, the kind of research projects we get will often be sequencing cancers up to 90x to 120x. And there's still a lot of research work to be done to determine what the right level of coverage is and that might even depend on what stage cancer you're analyzing at a given point in time. So we do, do that routinely in our services lab. So it's whole genome, but with higher coverage and we're able to accommodate that today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session.

During the call today, we will review the financial results released after the close of the market and offer commentary on our commercial activity, after which we will host a question-and-answer session.","If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release and earnings presentation, both can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at illumina.com.","Participating for Illumina today will be Francis deSouza, President and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Stapley, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer; and Sam Samad, Chief Financial Officer. Francis will provide a brief update on the state of our business and Sam will review our financial results.","This call is being recorded and the audio portion will be archived in the Investors section of our website.

Revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $662 million. The demand for NovaSeq again surpassed our expectations with orders beating forecast by over 30%. More than 230 NovaSeq instruments have been ordered since its launch in January.","As expected, we're seeing the beginning of the HiSeq replacement cycle with two-thirds of NovaSeq orders coming from HiSeq and HiSeq X labs accessing NovaSeq's improved sequencing costs and capabilities. With two quarters behind us, we're still at the very beginning of the HiSeq replacement cycle and our pipeline of NovaSeq opportunities continues to grow.","Equally importantly, we're also seeing the early signs of market elasticity. As new to sequencing and benchtop only customers accounted for more than one-third of the NovaSeq orders received. Commercial customers are fueling the early NovaSeq adoption, given the relative flexibility in their capital budgets. Interests from academic labs continues to build as customers work through the grant application process and this is expected to generate additional demand in the second half of this year and beyond.","I am pleased with the great work by our development and operations organizations in the second quarter, as we successfully tripled our NovaSeq manufacturing capacity compared to Q1, enabling us to ship and install approximately 80 instruments but we're not quite at full capacity yet. With our success to date, I am confident that the team will make the progress necessary to manufacture its capacity in the third quarter. After that, it will take a few quarters to work down our healthy backlog of more than 100 instruments, as is typical with our product launches.","Looking ahead our NovaSeq accessory device to enable customers to access each flow cell lane is progressing to our internal timelines and will ship in Q4. S1, S4 flow cell development timelines also remain on track. We expect S4 will ship in later September to early access customers with full availability of S4 and S1 to follow in October. As expected, NovaSeq has impacted HiSeq and HiSeq X shipments in the second quarter. Going forward, our outlook for this family of instruments remains muted, as we expect customers will choose to access our newest high throughput platform.","Moving to our benchtop portfolio, new-to-sequencing customers represented about half of NextSeq, MiniSeq and MiSeq shipments and our win rates remain stable. Utilization was within each instrument's respective guidance range. NextSeq pull-through increased compared to the prior year as commercial customers adopted the platform in production settings.","In Q2, microarray revenue including services grew 16% year-over-year to approximately $110 million. Shipments of array products and services to our direct to consumer customers more than doubled versus the prior year. Also in the consumer market, Helix launched their online marketplace a few weeks ago, which includes an initial 20 products and services that span entertainment, family, fitness, health, genealogy and nutrition.","As you know, we formed Helix to accelerate the adoption of consumer genomics. The strong growth of our direct to consumer customers and success of the Helix launch have together further fueled our enthusiasm for the role our technology will play in developing the consumer genomics market.","Moving now to our clinical markets, demand from oncology testing customers continues to be robust, with over 20% shipment growth versus the prior year, primarily driven by commercial molecular diagnostic and liquid biopsy customers. We reached an important milestone this quarter, when our Extended RAS companion diagnostic kit received FDA approval as the Class III PMA.","This product was developed in partnership with Amgen to identify patients who are eligible for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with Vectibix, and is the first oncology IVD, that we have brought to the market. And lastly in oncology, we are excited about the recent FDA pan cancer approval of Keytruda and the implications for genomics in patient care.","With this landmark approval, for the first time, patients can access treatment based on genomic biomarkers, rather than the anatomic origin of the cancer. We believe this is the first of many therapies where the genetic profile of the tumor will be a critical component of ensuring the best patient care.","Another recent product announcement was the launch of VeriSeq NIPT, a CE-IVD marked NGS solution. Since launch, adoption is ahead of our expectations and customer feedback has been very positive. Reimbursement in Europe is progressing as Belgium recently began covering T21 testing for all women, and the French Health Authority (sic) [French National Authority for Health] recommend NIPT coverage in pregnancies with greater than 1 to 1,000 risks.","In closing, I am pleased with our second quarter results, given the continued progress of our NovaSeq launch, the trends we are witnessing across the rest of our portfolio and market segments, and our team's execution. I will now turn the call over to Sam for a detailed overview of our second quarter results.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks, Francis. As Francis mentioned, revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $662 million. Sequencing consumables and microarrays exceeded forecast, which led to the outperformance versus our expectations.","Geographically, the Americas grew revenue 8% versus the prior year period, while Europe saw a 15% increase, primarily driven by sequencing consumables. Asia-Pacific revenue grew 12%. Continued weakness in Japan was more than offset by 16% shipment growth in greater China, which benefited from NovaSeq, strength in HiSeq X consumables, and continued NextSeq demand from our NIPT customers and partners.","Revenue from sequencing instruments grew 9% year-over-year to $130 million, driven primarily by NovaSeq demand. Total instrument revenue, which includes microarrays, increased 8% to $136 million. Consumable revenue represented 61% of total revenue or $402 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior period. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $338 million.","As we shared on our Q1 call, we expected customers to continue to ramp down HiSeq and HiSeq X reagent orders during the quarter, instead using inventory on hand as they prepare to integrate NovaSeq into their operations. As predicted, HiSeq consumables decreased sequentially, while utilization gains in China and translational liquid biopsy studies led to an increase in HiSeq X consumables.","Turing now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our non-GAAP results. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders.","Our Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 67%, up 60 basis points sequentially, driven by improved overhead absorption associated with higher production and decreased inventory reserves, which was partially offset by higher sequencing instrument mix.","Our Q2 guidance contemplated a slight sequential decline in margin based on lower sequencing consumable mix and absorption. Year-over-year gross margin decreased 540 basis points and was impacted by an increase in array services mix, inventory reserves related to product transitions, and lower instrument margin from the NovaSeq introduction.","As is typical with a new platform, we are actively working on COGS reduction, and expect NovaSeq margin to improve over the next four to six quarters. Operating expenses equaled $297 million, up $5 million sequentially, as head count adds were partially offset by the deconsolidation of GRAIL's expenses.","We had contemplated certain activities in our Q2 guidance that will now occur in Q3, including Helix's launch. This timing, as well as new investments initiated given our increased confidence in the full year outlook, are expected to lead to an increase in second half operating expense compared to the first half, with Q3 higher than Q4.","Non-GAAP operating margins were 22.1% compared to 17.5% in the first quarter, and lower than the 27.2% reported in the second quarter of last year, due to the previously mentioned drivers impacting gross margin and increased head count. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 24.4% compared to 22.9% in the first quarter. We reported second quarter GAAP net income of $128 million and EPS of $0.87 per diluted share, non-GAAP net income was $121 million or $0.82 of EPS, with Helix dilution of $0.05.","Cash flow from operations equaled $178 million, which was impacted by outflows of $13 million related to Helix, as well as a significant estimated income tax payment primarily related to the gain on the partial sale of our GRAIL stake in Q1.","Improved revenue linearity led to Q2 DSO of 51 days, compared to 56 days last quarter. Capital expenditures in Q2 were $69 million, and we reported an additional $32 million increase in property and equipment recorded under build-to-suit lease accounting, where such expenses were paid for by the landlord. Consequently, Q2 free cash flow was $109 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Turning to guidance, based on our strong first half results, we now project approximately 12% total company revenue growth and full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.36 to $5.46. We are reiterating our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.60 to $3.70, as a result of lower gross margin expectations given updated mix and higher NovaSeq revenue projections, as well as increased operating expense.","In closing, I am pleased with our strong second quarter results, the continued success of the NovaSeq launch, and the positive outlook for the rest of the year.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we will now open the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I want to start with the consumable dynamics, certainly a big delta, I guess, relative to what we'd been expecting. You mentioned HiSeq consumables decreased sequentially. I guess some of the increase was on China and liquid biopsy. Can you maybe just talk on those dynamics and how we should be thinking about the consumable ramp in the back half of the year?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Sure. There are a number of things that played out from a consumable dynamics perspective in Q2. In the high throughput segments, we did continue to see a decline in the HiSeq consumables as we talked about in Q1 and as we expect it to continue to play out. On the X side, we did see strength driven by both our customers in China as well as you mentioned and we talked about in the call, our translational liquid biopsy customers. And in fact as we looked at the X instruments that were connected into BaseSpace, we continued to see our customers running Xs as they usually had. And so we expect really the transition to happen to NovaSeq as S4 comes out later this year. But we are seeing customers continue to run their Xs.","And then in terms of consumables, we also saw strength in NextSeq as we continue to see customers looking to standardize on that platform for their production environments.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you. And then just one clarification, is the incremental OpEx in the back half of the year all tied to Helix, I had a few people, asking about just \u2013 you're not raising EPS due to the $0.15 beat. Is all that incremental spending Helix related?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","No, Helix is one of the factors, but it's certainly not the whole factor.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, Helix was more of a timing, Tycho, from Q2 into Q3 because of the launch in Q3. But as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, given the increased revenue projections, we have increased some of the investments in the back half and so now we will have a growth in the second half compared to the first half in terms of operating expenses.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And we haven't changed our Helix dilution Tycho, and obviously gross margin and the components of gross margin that Sam mentioned in the prepared remarks are also a driving factor.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Good afternoon. I guess some related questions. Again on consumables, you've talked about stalling in consumable spend as customers work through inventory and also pause to consider shifting from HiSeq and the X to NovaSeq. It seems like you may have seen some signs that we're moving past this, this quarter. Is that the case and I guess one way or the other, at what point do you think it's fair for us to at least contemplate in our models, a ramp in spend on a per NovaSeq basis? Is that the second half of this year or is that something we should be thinking about more as we move into 2018?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Sure. Maybe I'll start with the NovaSeq sort of when we get to \u2013 what the pull through rates and sort of how should we think about the ramp. So, obviously we've started to see a ramp in NovaSeq consumables play out in Q2, but this is sort of the beginning of that ramp. So, if you look at the high throughput consumable dynamic, as we said, we've already started to see the HiSeq consumables decline quarter-on-quarter. We, as S4 comes out, we expect to start to see some X customers draw down inventories as they start to move their payloads to NovaSeq as they get them. That hasn't yet started to play out, again, we expect that to really start to play out when we launch S4.","And so, over the next couple of quarters, you will see NovaSeq ramping up, you'll see that being offsetting the decline you expect to see in X and in HiSeq. And over the longer period, obviously, we expect to see a high-throughput consumables growth.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. That is helpful. And you touched on a few things that I was \u2013 I wanted to follow up on. One is, it sounds like there were a higher portion of orders coming from \u2013 NovaSeq orders coming from folks that are new to sequencing or maybe even moving up from benchtops than certainly I would have anticipated. One, is that the case, and then I guess somewhat related to that, what proportion of the market do you think is holding off on placing a formal order in advance of one, the S4 launch, and two, the launch of \u2013 the single laying (18:46) loading solution?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Okay. So, you've covered a lot of ground, not surprising me, and great questions. I'd start by saying that, yeah, I think we were actually pleasantly surprised to see about a third of the NovaSeq orders came from customers who were either new to sequencing entirely or who are benchtop customers, who didn't have any high throughput instruments at all. And I can share with you just, anecdotally, some of the examples. One of the examples is a customer in EMEA that opened up a new lab funded by government research to perform evolutionary genomics work and sort of saw the NovaSeq, as sort of the right price point for them to launch that lab. Another customer also in the same region, purchased NovaSeq to perform routine reproductive health testing in the country which has been historically underserved in this regard. So they plan to start offering clinical excellence services to their customers, fundamentally enabled by the pricing of NovaSeq and its lower cost per sample. The other set of customers that surprised us were customers who were Illumina customers but were benchtop only customers. And one example is a lab that's projecting to sequence 1,000 genomes and 300 to 400 exomes annually for the next few years. And they saw NovaSeq as again at the right sort of price point for them to move up from being a benchtop only customer.","So again, the fact that that was a third of the NovaSeq orders was a really good thing from our perspective and a really encouraging sign for the demand from that segment and exceeded our expectations. In terms of who's not yet bought and how we're thinking about who's bought, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, we are at the very, very beginning of the HiSeq replacement cycle. Less than 10% of HiSeq customers have ordered a NovaSeq so far. So the bulk of this wave is still in front of us.","And let me give you some profiles of people that are \u2013 will be buying in the future. For example if you are an academic customer and you came into this year with a fixed budget, what you're doing now in some cases is you are writing your grant applications, and using that to get the budget for NovaSeqs in the future. And so there are customers like that that want NovaSeq, they expect to get it and are securing the funding now. As I said in the prepared remarks, a lot of this early interest came from commercial customers. And as you know, they have more flexibility with their budgets and we're able to move more quickly. And so then they would be academic customers, a certain segment of them would be example of customers that are planning to get a NovaSeq but haven't pulled the trigger yet.","And then in terms of, you asked about the accessory device, there are customers, the core labs specifically, that are waiting for the accessory device because of how they run their services and they'd like to do the single addressing per lane, whether it's to run a genome per lane. And so for them, that device will be fundamentally enabling and that doesn't ship as you know till Q4. There are other customers that are looking at S4 the same way, so, other examples of customers that are planning their purchases but haven't pulled the trigger yet.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","So fair to say that at this point you're tracking well ahead of plan in terms of number of orders with a lot of the upside coming from commercial customers and new to sequencing customers with the potential for a potential acceleration in growth as you roll out some of the new accessories, the S4 chip and as those who are writing grants are actually in a better position to actually buy instruments, would that be a fair characterization?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. That's exactly right, Doug.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Thank you. Doug, I would also just \u2013 and remember this is a multi-year refresh cycle that we're going to see here, so with 800 customers to address, it's going to take \u2013 and not necessarily every single one of them are fully addressable. It's going to take a number of years to play out.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Fair point. Thank you, Marc. Thanks, Francis.","Operator","And the next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Hi, Derik.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Hi, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, great. So just a couple of questions, just to clarify. You did say 80 installs for Novas in Q2. Correct?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, that's right.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. That's what I thought. So 30 HiSeqs came out of the installed base, can you say which of those \u2013 are all those related to sort of like NovaSeq orders and how should we think about the HiSeqs coming out over the next several quarters? Is 20 to 30 reasonable a run rate to think about this going forward?","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","So Derik on that question, it's not actually an item that we forecast. We have a pretty stringent hurdle for taking things out of the installed base. It effectively has to be very \u2013 effectively disconnected and practically in the closet, if you will or put away to a different location. So it's not a number that we forecast and therefore it's challenging for us to make that comment. I think it's also, therefore, challenging to tie that specifically to NovaSeq orders. Obviously many of these customers are transitioning to the NovaSeq platform and one lends itself to the other, but they aren't necessarily exactly at the same customers and locations.","What we typically see is customers will buy a new platform and it will take them a couple of quarters, they'll keep the platform on hand to use if they need some extra capacity and then it'll take the many \u2013 a few years to actually officially turn that instrument off.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And so without the Helix launch the other day and very interesting on that, can you give us a little bit more color on, now that the first apps are launched, in terms of how the revenue opportunity for Illumina flows through? And I guess, as you look at 2018, does it begin to start to contribute to the top line of the company?","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, Derik, it's Marc here. It's only been a week or so, it's a little too early to tell. We're not changing our expectations for revenue for Helix this year compared to our previous comments around that. But 2018 will certainly be an interesting year. We got to prove out the model here with this launch, and show that the sequence once, query many times model really works and we believe it does, and that's why we set up Helix, and we're very pleased with the launch, but too early to see how the traction is impacted yet. There's another launch in the Bay Area this week, and we'll continue to monitor progress over time and, at the appropriate time, report out on that.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks, Doug.","Operator","And the next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI, please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, everybody. So maybe just sticking on some of the anecdotal customer comments because (26:10) of the \u2013 Francis that was super helpful. Can you help us sort of understand the discussion around elasticity, particularly on the high end, as we're sort of approaching this S4 launch? What's the sort of feedback you're getting from some of the larger clinical customers? How are, at a country level, some of the pop seq [population sequence] studies sort of progressing, how are we just thinking about, as that price point's about to inflect again, the sort of preparation or the sort of conversations maybe you're having with some of these potential customers, and how has that kind of evolved since maybe the initial launch in the beginning of the year?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Sure, Ross, so the feedback we're getting from customers, the high throughput customers, is very positive and generally consistent that they are looking at NovaSeq as fundamentally enabling them to do higher intensity sequencing, so whether it's the move to genomes, much deeper exomes, or high depth oncology, whether it's liquid biopsy or solid tumor screening (27:17). So we're definitely having the conversations with those customers who are looking at NovaSeq as enabling those high intensity sequencing applications, and we're very encouraged about what that means in terms of the amount of sequencing that we expect to be generated through the elasticity enabled by NovaSeq. We are also seeing NovaSeq help push forward some of the population sequencing discussions we've been having around the world. Those are long-term endeavors and some we've been working for a little while, but I think it leads, in a number of cases, it's pretty fair to say that NovaSeq is catalyzing those conversations to move more quickly than they were before NovaSeq.","Now, that's also dovetailing with some good results that are now coming out of GEL. And other countries talking to GEL and getting more clarity around what it could do for them. And so, it's enabled by NovaSeq, but we also have the good timing that GEL is now at a place where they can actually show the output of their sequencing work. And so, that's helping too.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And how would you just characterize kind of how the ecosystem has formed around some of these projects, as again, given where the price point is going, the scope of some of these studies could be quite substantial, whether it's from an informatics standpoint or from a sample prep or sample acquisition. I mean you guys have done a lot to start to help bring in others that bring in other capabilities in some of these large-scale projects. How would you say that's kind of developed over the balance of the year so far?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. Philip (sic) [Ross], we started actually last year, and partially in anticipation with NovaSeq, to be more intentional about working with the ecosystem to make sure that our customers had access to the best end-to-end work flows, whether they were Illumina or not. And so, we have consciously been cultivating more partnerships and deeper relationships with the partners we work with. So that's going to continue to be part of our strategy going forward.","That will help play out in the population sequencing efforts, where we can start to talk about \u2013 first of all, we actually do have a reference architecture that is deployed at GEL. And while a lot of that is Illumina, we certainly are working with partners at GEL, and we now have a working implementation that we can talk to other countries about. And you can imagine, from other countries' perspective, it significantly de-risks a deal to have a reference architecture that is already fully implemented. And a number of them are looking to replicate, in a lot of ways almost exactly, what GEL has done. So that's been very helpful in terms of creating the ecosystem, and then having an integrated platform like GEL where we can demonstrate it working.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Very helpful. And congrats guys on all the great momentum.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Thank you.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks, Ross.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon, thank you. So, I just had a quick follow-up to some of the commentary about should how things might trend through the year, so you \u2013 you talked specifically about the (30:40) consumables being a bit ahead of your expectations, but I think the placement number also came in quite high relative to guidance, and obviously you talked about the backlog and working that down.","So I'm just trying to figure out, in context of all the commentary around sort of, I guess, some of the prior commentary, I think you had said that you expect high throughput consumables to be up in the back half. So is that still the case? And then just help us think about kind of the pace of maybe placement in light of the revised guidance?","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","So, Amanda, just one clarification to your question. We did not guide to a NovaSeq instrument number for the second quarter. So, obviously the 80 unit figure, we weren't commenting on whether or not that was higher than, lower than our expectations in the prepared remarks effectively because it was roughly in line with our expectations. And with regard to the ramp from here, I think, you can expect to see a slight sequential ramp in instrument placements. Obviously the number of units that we placed this quarter from a shipment perspective was quite meaningful. So, I think, that you should expect very slight increase from these types of levels. And lastly with regard to HiSeq, HiSeq X and NovaSeq consumables the net of those three, I think, we aren't necessarily guiding to what that will be in any given quarter but we believe that in aggregate, high throughput consumables will grow. There may be some timing of when X work down occurs versus NovaSeq ramp up occurs, so that may introduce a little bit of lumpiness in the quarter here and there but in aggregate over a multi quarter period, we would expect growth in that segment of the consumables market.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. And then I just also had one on the S4, so appreciate all the commentary there. But it feels like \u2013 like you said there are some customers waiting to place orders, we see that step (32:36) but also it feels like some customers that maybe have placed orders are also waiting. So I just wanted to see kind of the risk around that. You're pretty comfortable about the timelines or it sounds like you are, but just wanted to clarify. And then do you think the beta launch is kind of enough to get some of the existing customers that ordered ready to receive the rest of the five (32:59)?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, and I'll say certainly, we believe that there are customers who haven't ordered yet, that are waiting for S4. But as you point out, there are also customers that have made some initial purchases that are looking to S4 to be a reason why they do a broader rollout across their fleet. And so there will be both types of customers that really sort of ramp up as S4 comes out. I am confident in the timelines. We expect to have early access customers out in September, I feel good about that and we expect to have broad availability starting in October.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks very much.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Bill Burke (sic) [Bill Quirk] from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, guys.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Hi.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Couple of questions, first off (33:50).","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Hey, Bill. Bill you're breaking up a bit.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Sorry, (33:57). Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","No. No.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Get in the queue (34:05). Sorry about that.","Operator","I'll move on, and Bill you can queue back up when you get a better connection, one moment. Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citi. Please go ahead.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, hi, thanks for the question. Francis, on the pull through for the Nova, obviously the revenue potentials for a lab that's fully ramped is substantial and I'm sure you don't want to give an average annualized number at this point, though I guess I'd be happy to listen if you did. But just given that there a bunch of labs that are in production mode, would you be able to talk about just where the highest throughput commercial machines are tracking towards from a dollar standpoint?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","So, obviously we know, I can tell you today if it was useful but it isn't. I'd tell you today we know what our NovaSeq \u2013 our early NovaSeq customers are running today in terms of utilization. But we also know from launching many instruments that the numbers today are not going to be a representative of the ultimate pull through range that you will see in the first set of customers. You may in fact \u2013 you probably will in fact see it go up initially before it settles into a more normal pull through number, and that'll take four to six quarters from launch before we get to a range that that's actually useful from a modeling perspective. And so we'll continue to watch for that and as we feel like it's settling into a range that that's more normal, that's the stage where we'll come out and share what numbers you should be using from a modeling perspective. But it's definitely too early for us to call that number yet.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And maybe just following up on Derik's replacement question, I'm curious how you're thinking about decommissions or trade-ins of the X systems. Could this be a formal trade-in program or is it, are you thinking it can be more ad hoc, anything on just how that installed base might track over time, would be helpful?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, initially when we first launched the NovaSeq, as we typically do, we did have a trade-in program and we had, we offered our customers the ability to look at instruments they had ordered that were in our backlog that they hadn't taken yet. And use those dollars to switch over from an X for example, to NovaSeq. And so, we did that when we launched.","Going forward, it's going to be less of a trade-in, it's going to be more of a \u2013 they decommission and they buy a new instrument. And so that was very much a launch effect rather than a sort of a permanent offer. And so that's how we expect it to play out.","And from a customer's perspective, in a lot of cases, the math is pretty compelling. They know what their run rate is in terms of cost per GI, (36:49) they're on a, one of their HiSeq platforms or in an X. And they know their sample volumes and so they can figure out the breakeven point pretty quickly.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And from a logistical perspective, the way we go about removing HiSeqs from the installed base will be the exact same way, we go about removing HiSeq X, so that high barrier will be there as well. And so I think what you'll see is effectively the HiSeq X utilization decrease in favor of NovaSeq and it'll take a while before those instruments start coming out of the installed base.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So, on applications, Francis, if you could help me understand any sense of applications that are gaining prominence in the leading customers in NovaSeq so far? I know S2 is the only one that's out there, so any sense of what applications are gaining ground here?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So I'll tell you what customers are talking to us about, and I'll share some that we're already starting to see. So, we are definitely having conversations as I said earlier around customers that are looking to do higher intensity sequencing. So many conversations are happing around deeper exomes, about moving from exomes to genomes. We are having conversations about doing much, much deeper sequencing in cancer biopsies and then obviously very, very deep sequencing for liquid biopsies. Those are all very active conversations enabled again fundamentally by the price points associated with NovaSeq.","And then we're seeing \u2013 and then across our portfolio so not just NovaSeq, there are other areas where we're seeing the move to sequencing happen in some areas from arrays for example. We see that happening in the PGS space as we move from microarrays to sequencing. And so those are some of the areas where we're seeing newer conversations about higher intensity sequencing.","Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, got it. And a question about the bottom 600 cohort of your 800 customer base on the high throughput end. I'm just trying to understand if when speaking to the academic and core lab operations, are you getting any sense with the lane splitting manifold device, and S2, might just be good enough for them. Are you seeing those customers as still wanting an S4?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","There are customers in both camps. I mean there are customers depending on the scale of your lab and the number of samples that you're running, there are customers where S2 will be a perfectly fine flow cell. And we expect to have a set of customers like that. And S4 is again very, very well suited, if you're doing genomes or deep exomes. And so for other applications, I fully expect S2 to be a in demand flow cell.","Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I was hoping you could elaborate more on what you're seeing in the consumer market for microarrays and how your expectations changed in your 2017 guidance for microarrays in the consumer market.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, we came into this year, with momentum in the consumer market and that momentum has continued to accelerate. And so, we talked about the fact that our shipments to our direct to consumer customers have doubled from last year. That's driven by the strength in the ancestry market, driven by the strength in the health traits market. And that looks like it's going to continue \u2013 that momentum. Now, over time, it's possible that they continue \u2013 these customers continue to offer array based services, and we just continue to see that momentum build. But it's also possible that over time, some of them decided to move to sequencing. And so, that'll be good for the industry. That'll be good for Illumina. But it means that we will see some revenue shift away from arrays into sequencing.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And just one thing to add to that, Dan. The array services line was not necessarily a meaningful driver of the beat in the second quarter.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I'm just looking at it versus Street models. It seems like it was a big delta. Can you quantify any of the increases...","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Well, I would say that the Street model number isn't necessarily clear, because some analysts do model array services in the array number, and some do model it excluding. So outside of \u2013 just in services alone, so I think, it's actually hard to bifurcate that number based on the differences in how people model that.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I guess, then my follow-up. Could you clarify, of the increase in revenue guidance, how much of that was due to arrays versus sequencing?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","A very small part was arrays. I mean, it was \u2013 yeah \u2013 the majority was not...","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","The vast majority was NovaSeq. (42:21)","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Just couple of follow-up items, one on the microarray business was up pretty strong double digits. Interested in how much of that you think was share versus market growth. And what's baked into your outlook for the rest of the year?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","So, we have really good share in those markets. I'd say, the big driver there is just market growth. I mean, we are seeing really strong growth again in the ancestry portion of the market, in the health traits portion of the market, the 23andMe and sort of their ability to offer tests, part of the FDA guidance has been really good for them. And so, in general, we're seeing really robust demand in the consumer market. And that's driven the demand from our direct-to-consumer customers.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then, as a follow-up, I know it's early days, but for liquid biopsy, I'm curious if you could quantify, either as a percentage of your diagnostic revenue or as a percentage of new customers or \u2013 some metric to give us a sense of how significant that part of the market is for your business at this point and then maybe as we look towards the end of the year, the ramp. Because it's a very fluid market, I'm interested in just a snapshot today, and where we're going in the next six months.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, it's hard for us to give you the size of that for us. What I'll say is look, the \u2013 some of the drivers there are just some of the large studies that are happening. So, not necessarily the diagnostic portion of the market, there's some of that, but some of the big drivers have been just some very large studies that are playing out in liquid biopsy.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And that portion of the market is captured in the oncology testing segment that we highlighted in the script there, Isaac, just so you have that context.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sure. Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, it's Steve Beuchaw here.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Hi, Steve.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, question on the second half outlook. Sam, there are just a lot of moving parts in the second half outlook, with all the variables that people have done a great job of spiking out here in the Q&A. Could you give us any sense for what seasonality on the top line looks like? There's clearly acceleration implied in the guidance. Is it a small step up to 3Q, big step up to 4Q? Any help there would be very much appreciated. And then I have just one follow-up.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. I'll start, and then Sam, maybe you can comment too. I'll say, on the one hand, there are a lot of moving parts, but I'd say a really big driver here of the year is NovaSeq. And so that's sort of a very big theme, even in the second half. And I said in Q3, we're going to get to expand our manufacturing capacity a little bit ahead of where we were even in Q2, and so that allows us to ship more NovaSeqs and then start to sort of address some of the backlog as well. And so I think, while there are a lot of moving parts, I think there's sort of a really big theme around NovaSeq that's pretty straightforward. So, Sam?","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. No. I think that's pretty much it. We do have a ramp-up in the second half. And I think it's really driven by a couple of factors. One is the ramp-up in NovaSeq as \u2013 NovaSeq instruments \u2013 as Francis mentioned, as well as the ramp-up in NovaSeq consumables. And partially offsetting that, there is going to be a reduction in the HiSeq and HiSeq X placements and the offsetting decline in consumables as well. So, you have these moving parts, but outweighed by the growth related to NovaSeq instruments and consumables.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just within that, could you give us a sense for how much, if any, your expectations for the impact of currency have changed, top line and bottom line? And that would be it for me. Thanks so much.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. For the full year, Steve, there's really no material impact, both on revenue and EPS, from currency movements compared to our previous assumptions and overall.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the service revenue growth this quarter. Could you walk through some of the buckets and where you're seeing the strength really drive some of the upside there?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. I'd say there are probably a couple of buckets. So, in services, we already talked about the strength in the microarray services, driven in large part by our direct to consumer customers, so that's sort of one big bucket of strength there. And then obviously, there are just service contracts associated with more instrument placements, and that's been another driver there.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And both are around the same rough dollar size, in terms of dollar growth year-over-year. Obviously array dropped...","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Off of a lower base.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And clearly, there's a lot going on with the Illumina thesis at this point, but we're getting closer to, when you had originally talked about launching the Firefly sometime in the second half of 2017. I was wondering if you could give an update on that product launch timeline?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","The team is continuing to make progress on the sequencer, and so we are on track for end of the year, sort of early 2018 launch on the sequencer side. And then, after the team gets that out, we'll focus on the library prep instrument. So, good progress, no real news at this point though.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. I wanted to come back to the elasticity question on the NovaSeq, and I do appreciate the anecdotal information you shared. If you just drill down into the customers who are specifically new to sequencing, what kind of work have you done there to try to figure out how many of those there might be out in the market?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","We have done our own internal modeling around what we expect the overall addressable market is for sequencing and for the different parts of our sequencing portfolio. Those aren't numbers that we have shared externally, but we certainly use them from a modeling the demand perspective. I'd say though, in Q2, the demand we saw from the new to sequencing and the benchtop only customers exceeded our internal expectations from that part of the market.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Well, I think if you look back at HiSeq X, it was an interesting experiment there that showed when hit certain price points, a lot of new customers that you wouldn't have anticipated come out of the woodwork, and X was a great example of that. NovaSeq, obviously with the S4 starts to also address new price points too. So who knows where it's going to go. There's always going to be some new customers and new applications we really haven't been able to anticipate.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. We'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi, thanks, good afternoon. Hope you can hear me now. So, just...","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","We can.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","...thinking about the one-third of orders for NovaSeq that went into either new to sequencing or some of the benchtop customers. Can you just remind us how many benchtop only customers you have? And how should we be thinking about them longer term transitioning into the NovaSeq family? Thanks.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","In terms of benchtop only, Bill, I don't have that number off the top of my fingertips. Obviously with more than 2,000 NextSeqs and 5,000 MiSeqs out there, obviously there are some multi-units in there, but there are quite a number of benchtop only customers. And I don't think it would be appropriate to expect all of them to move up the kind of complexity curve to a high throughput instrument. But obviously, when we do see new to sequencing customers come in, we tend to see them come in through the benchtop, and as that grow in sophistication, a portion of them do go to the high throughput upper market. Obviously, this is a very nice opportunity for us, but it's just another demonstration of the elasticity that NovaSeq can bring to this market by encouraging those customers who may not have, today, the dollars or the complexity to encourage high throughput sequencing with this product, they now can bring forth projects and incremental dollars to do so.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. And one exercise you can do is, as Rebecca said, look, we said there are 800 HiSeq customers out there. There are about 2,000 NextSeq customers out there, and about 5,000 MiSeq customers. So you can do the math that says well, even if there's a full overlap, that means that there are 1,200 NextSeq customers at least that don't have a HiSeq right, so you can start to do some sketching around the boundaries of what that number could be at the low end.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","That's very helpful. And then just thinking about, I guess, some of the long-term margin profile for NovaSeq. As we think about more of the HiSeqs coming out of the overall installed base and obviously over time, transition to more NovaSeqs. Can you just comment about things like service expense and should we expect \u2013 or service margin rather and should we expect, again, longer term, that we could see some leverage there for Illumina? Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","I think there could be a marginal impact there, if you're servicing three different lines. If you're looking at the HiSeq, the X and the NovaSeq, and it eventually sort of converges to NovaSeq that could be some marginal improvements in terms of margin, but I'd say those are marginal.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Knight (sic) [Paul Knight] from Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi, Rebecca. Could you talk to the level of sales of sequencers to GRAIL?","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. It's a fair question, Paul. Obviously GRAIL is now a customer of ours and like any other customer we're not actually able to provide specific sales figures to them. Any sales to GRAIL would be included in the commentary around oncology testing.","Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","The level of microarray services sales was high. What were the exact drivers around the services number in the quarter?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","The big drivers were our direct to consumer customers.

My name is Michelle, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s conference. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ms. Jacquie Ross. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.","Jacquie Ross","Thank you, Michelle. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our earnings call for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017. During the call today, we will review the financial results released after the close of the market and offer commentary on our commercial activity, after which we will host a question-and-answer session. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at illumina.com.","Participating for Illumina today will be Francis deSouza, President and Chief Executive Officer; Sam Samad, Chief Financial Officer. Francis will provide a brief update on the state of our business and Sam will review our financial results.","This call is being recorded and will be archived in the Investors section of our website. It is our intent that all forward-looking statements regarding our financial results and commercial activity made during today\u2019s call will be protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual events or results may differ materially from those projected or discussed.","All forward-looking statements are based upon current available information, and Illumina assumes no obligation to update these statements. To better understand the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ, we refer you to the documents that Illumina files with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Illumina\u2019s most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Francis.","Francis deSouza","Thank you, Jacquie. Good afternoon, everyone. Illumina finished 2017 on a high note, with revenue of $778 million, growth across both our sequencing and array businesses and notable strength in sequencing consumables.","For the full-year, revenue grew 15% to $2.75 billion. Sequencing consumables grew by more than 30% year-over-year to $432 million, with contributions from each of our product families. The primary contributor to the more than $100 million year-over-year increase was NovaSeq, followed by NextSeq and the HiSeq family and then our other desktop platforms.","NovaSeq consumable revenue almost tripled sequentially with strong demand for the newly released S4 flow cell in addition to growing interest in S2. Even excluding $19 million stocking order, NovaSeq consumables grew by more than 75% sequentially.","Fourth quarter HiSeq X consumables were up modestly from Q3. Most of our HiSeq X customers have taken, at least, one NovaSeq. And now that S4 has been launched, some of these customers will transition their fleets in 2018, while others will move in 2019 or later, depending on the cadence of their clinical, translational and research activities.","Excluding HiSeq X, HiSeq consumables were up driven by clinical customers. Similar to HiSeq X transition plans, among the approximately 800 customers are staggered across the multi-year horizon. That said, we continue to expect HiSeq consumables in aggregate to start to trend downwards in the coming quarters.","NextSeq consumables had another strong quarter, and average pull-through was once again above the high-end of our target range, driven by production clinical customers. Nextera DNA Flex got off to a strong start in October, as growing appreciation of the simplified workflow led to orders for more than 300 unique customers.","Since the launch of AmpliSeq for Illumina, a few weeks ago, I\u2019m pleased to share that we have received and shipped our first orders for the latest addition to our library prep portfolio. We also reported a strong sequencing systems quarter with revenue of $131 million. NovaSeq shipments were in the high 80s, the most we shipped during any quarter in 2017, reflecting customer readiness for their systems.","As expected and consistent with the third quarter, we did not ship any HiSeq Xs in the fourth quarter and we shipped just a handful of HiSeqs as most high-throughput customers are now looking to NovaSeq. With approximately 285 NovaSeqs shipped in 2017, we are very encouraged by the systems performance in its first year of launch.","Interest to date has included an impressive cross-section of HiSeq X customers, HiSeq customers, new customers, as well as customers moving up from desktop instruments to take on higher output applications or increased sample volumes. NovaSeq is demonstrating a very broad appeal.","For the third consecutive quarter, about one-third of NovaSeq\u2019s orders received were from new to Illumina or straight from benchtop customers. New to Illumina customers included a number of academic and transitional labs looking to build out their offerings for clinical testing, whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing. Straight from benchtop customers included a diverse set of labs building on their MiSeq and NextSeq capabilities to extend into exomes, methylation arrays, RNA, ctDNA and whole genome sequencing.","Beyond this group, the HiSeq conversion opportunity remains very much ahead of us with only 15% of the approximately 850 HiSeq or HiSeq X customers having ordered their first NovaSeq as of the end of 2017. NovaSeq represents a compelling opportunity for these customers, most of whom will recognize a significant economic benefit from the transition.","Beyond the price per sample economics, NovaSeq offers higher throughput, easier workflow and the ability to easily scale output to support a diverse suite of application and sample volumes. So we expect that the vast majority of these HiSeq customers will transition to NovaSeq over time.","NextSeq continues to perform well. And the system and associated consumables remain a very important growth driver for Illumina, as customers use a system for a broad set of research, translational and clinical applications. Rounding out our benchtop systems, we continue to see stable win rates and solid adoption by new to sequencing customers, who represented approximately 60% of MiniSeq and MiSeq shipments in the fourth quarter.","We look forward to shipping the first commercial units of our latest desktop system, the iSeq, towards the end of the first quarter. iSeq delivers exceptional accuracy at a low-capital cost of less than $20,000, making our SBS technology accessible to any lab.","You will have seen that the beta units are operating very well in the field, and we have already received customer orders reflecting strong initial demand. As is routine for a product launch at Illumina, we will be shipping a small number of iSeqs this quarter to be followed by a manufacturing ramp to 2018. That said, we do not plan on sharing order or shipment details on the iSeq on a quarterly basis. While this is an important strategic platform for Illumina, it is unlikely to have any material revenue driver in the near-term.","In other product updates, we look forward to adding the S1 flow cell to the NovaSeq portfolio to further extend the flexibility for our lower throughput customers and those looking for rapid turnaround on higher output applications. We\u2019ve completed internal validation and started beta testing of S1 in anticipation of commercial release later this quarter.","S1 offers very compelling per sample economics versus HiSeq and the ability for HiSeq customers to easily transition projects due to its lower output. S1 also delivers the fastest run times of all NovaSeq configurations, delivering 500G runs in just over 24 hours. Reflecting our investments and focus, our clinical business continued to grow in the fourth quarter, notably in oncology and NIPT.","In total, clinical and translational customers represented about 45% of our shipments in 2017, compared to 39% in 2016. And we expect incremental adoption of our products and technology in the coming years, given the importance of genomics and solving human health challenges.","As we have shared previously, our strategy to further catalyze clinical adoption is to provide clinical-grade instruments and reagents to customers who wish to develop their own solutions, while developing sample to answer solutions in areas of the market, where we are uniquely positioned.","As part of this, we launched NextSeqDx in mid-November to bolster our clinical instrument offerings and we shipped our first systems in the fourth quarter. These initial customers plan to use their systems for routine non-small cell lung cancer liquid biopsy testing and clinical assay development.","Oncology is the largest and fastest growing area within clinical, driven primarily by customers focused on therapy selection and liquid biopsy. In total, our oncology testing shipments grew about 40% in 2017. Development work on our sample to answer solutions progressed in the fourth quarter, with TST 170 now available as an IUO as well as RUO.","Building on our TST 170 panel, we have launched an immunooncology program. As we believe that Illumina is uniquely positioned to deliver a distributable IVD solution, offering a turnkey solution to pharma partners and customers. We continue to see positive coverage decisions in the field of oncology.","Most recently, Cigna announced a significant policy change, extending previous coverage for panels of less than 10 genes with proven clinical utility to larger panels with a medical necessity criteria is met for, at least, one gene on that panel. We believe that this will be particularly helpful for clinical trial enrollment, increasing the utility and utilization of multi-gene panels over time.","NIPT is another focus area for Illumina and we\u2019re very pleased with the performance of VeriSeq NIPT, which received CE Mark in April 2017 and it\u2019s our first true sample to answer IVD product. Sales are expected to more than double in 2018, driven in part by the Dutch National contract, which we were awarded during the fourth quarter and some other key competitive wins. We will submit NIPT IVD solutions in many more countries throughout 2018 and look forward to the continued adoption of this product globally.","Our microarray revenue grew 21% from the same quarter in 2016, due to strong growth among our direct-to-consumer customers. Full-year growth was 20%, driven by the acceleration in the number of consumer samples processed during 2017.","Our consumer affiliate, Helix, announced a partnership with the Healthy Nevada Project to expand one of the first community-based population health studies in the United States. Led by the Renown Institute for Health Innovation, the project plans to enroll 40,000 Nevadans and utilize the Helix platform to collect and sequence the samples.","The Healthy Nevada Project started in 2016 with an initial 10,000 participants, who submitted samples for genotyping analysis. Phase II of the project has expanded to exome-plus analysis in an effort to gain additional health determinants data.","Before I hand over to Sam, I would like to formally welcome Aimee Hoyt, who joined Illumina to lead our Human Resources team earlier this month. We believe that our corporate culture is one of our strongest competitive differentiators, and we\u2019ve invested a good amount of time in finding our Chief People Officer. I\u2019m confident that Aimee is the right person to evolve our unique culture and our commitment to innovative people practices.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Sam for a review of our financials. Sam?","Sam Samad","Thanks, Francis. As discussed, fourth quarter revenue grew 26% year-over-year to $778 million, driven by growth in sequencing consumables that once again exceeded forecast, as well as strong performance in sequencing instruments and on microarrays portfolio.","Graphically, Americas grew revenue 32% versus the prior year period, driven by strong growth in both sequencing instruments and consumables, while EMEA grew 25%. Asia-Pacific grew 9% overall with 12% shipment growth in Greater China.","Revenue from sequencing instruments grew 18% year-over-year to $131 million, driven primarily by NovaSeq and offset in part by muted shipments of the HiSeq family of instruments as expected.","Microarray instrument revenue was $8 million, down as expected from an unusually strong Q3. Total instrument revenue was therefore $139 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year and represented 18% of total revenue.","As Francis noted, fourth quarter sequencing consumable revenue was $432 million, up more than 30% from last year. Microarray consumable revenue of $82 million was up 8%. Total consumable revenue of $514 million represented 66% of total revenue.","Fourth quarter total product revenue, which includes freight was $659 million, up 26% from the year-ago quarter. Service and other was $119 million, up 27% from the same quarter last year, driven by strength in genotyping services due to consumer demand, as well as sequencing services and instrument maintenance contracts.","Moving to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our non-GAAP results, which includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today\u2019s earning release and supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earning per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina shareholders.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 70.9% improved 210 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable sequencing consumables mix, as well as improved cost savings from NovaSeq. Year-over-year, gross margin increased to 140 basis points and was impacted by higher sequencing consumables mix and the favorable impact associated with the lack of product transition reserves that occurred in Q4 of 2016.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $307 million, up $8 million from last quarter with higher stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by lower Helix expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.4%, up 460 basis points sequentially and higher than the 25.1% reported in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding Helix, operating margin was 33.9% compared to 29.7% in the third quarter.","For the fourth quarter, GAAP net income was $68 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $212 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, and Helix dilution was $0.06. The non-GAAP tax rate was lower sequentially due to our higher foreign mix of earnings.","Cash flow from operations equaled $294 million. Continued reductions in our collections cycle led to Q4 DSO of 48 days, compared to 49 days last quarter. Capital expenditures in Q4 were $76 million and Q4 free cash flow was $218 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 368,000 shares under our previously announced buyback program at an average price of $204.","Moving to guidance, and as we previously shared, total company revenue is expected to grow between 13% and 14% in 2018, including a modest revenue contribution from Helix. Mix remains the primary driver of our gross margin. And we therefore, currently expect full-year non-GAAP gross margin to be up slightly from 2017.","GAAP EPS is expected to be between $4.14 and $4.24, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $4.50 and $4.60. This includes an approximately $0.10 benefit associated with tax reform and about $0.25 of Helix dilution.","Some other items for you to keep in mind. First, and as Francis discussed, the activity we are seeing among our customers is consistent with our belief that the NovaSeq upgrade cycle will span multiple years. Going forward, we will report NovaSeq shipments on an annual basis in an effort to minimize volatility associated with normal quarterly fluctuation. For 2018 and compared to the approximately 285 NovaSeq shipments reported in 2017, we expect to ship between 330 and 350 NovaSeq systems.","With regards to Q1, specifically, I\u2019ll remind you that we do not expect the $19 million stocking order to repeat. Additionally, you should expect sequencing system revenue to be down sequentially in line with normal first quarter seasonality. As a results and after an exceptional fourth quarter, we expect first quarter revenue to be up to $35 million lower on a sequential basis.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call back to Francis for a few comments before we open the Q&A session.","Francis deSouza","Thanks, Sam. Looking forward, I\u2019m excited about Illumina\u2019s opportunity in 2018 and beyond. As I just discussed the JPMorgan a few weeks back, we are seeing the regulatory and reimbursement decisions that will ultimately enable sequencing to move firmly into the clinic, where it will positively impact patient outcomes. In many cases, these changes are emerging faster than we could have expected, which is a positive indicator for Illumina\u2019s growth in the years to come.","For 2018, specifically, there are many factors that will contribute to Illumina\u2019s continued growth. First, our NovaSeq system that remains in the earliest stages of the upgrade cycle, and as we expected, looks set for a multi-year transition. Notable within this category, Xp workflow and S4 were launched late in 2017, so we will benefit from a full-year of release in 2018.","Additionally, we have the launch of S1 this quarter, so we expect NovaSeq consumables to continue to grow rapidly in 2018. Beyond NovaSeq, we have an impressive portfolio of products that are new or just launched, including iSeq, Nextera DNA Flex and AmpliSeq for Illumina.","In population genomics, we have a number of national initiatives that are ramping in 2018. And of course, our consumer business continues to grow through our array customers in addition to a modest contribution from Helix, still only in its first few quarters of launch. In clinical, 2018 will represent our first full-year of sales of VeriSeq NIPT CE-IVD and the ramp up of some new large customers.","NextSeq is proving to be a workhorse for our clinical customers, so we expect to continue strong \u2013 to see strong pull-through performance and consumer growth. We expect to see continued and potentially accelerating traction in rugged, given the expanded insurance coverage for whole exome sequencing achieved in 2017.","Finally, we expect to see continued growth among our oncology customers, as they continue their important and potentially transformative work. I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2018. 2017 was a terrific year, and I\u2019d like to thank the Illumina team for the commitment and execution that delivered such a strong year.","Operator, we\u2019d now like to begin our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir..We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] The first question in the queue comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Doug Schenkel","Okay. Good afternoon and thank you. You closed out 2017 clearly with a lot of momentum in addition to having the NovaSeq out there without manufacturing constraints. You now have the S4 and the single line loading device out in the field, and as you just mentioned, the S1 coming soon.","Essentially, you have all the tools at your disposal out there to drive placements and utilization and probably visibility is improving. With that said, for those of us outside the company, there\u2019s still lingering questions on how replacing HiSeqs with NovaSeqs is going to impact overall consumable revenue.","Based on what you\u2019re seeing in the field about a year into this launch on a dollar basis, do you expect same-store consumable sales to increase in labs that replace HiSeqs with NovaSeqs? Essentially, based on what you\u2019re seeing out there with placements and replacements, how confident are you today that volume elasticity will be enough to offset pricing reductions afforded to these customers?","Francis deSouza","Sure. So thanks for that question, Doug. Even as we were planning for the launch of NovaSeq, we were spending a lot of time with our HiSeq customers and our HiSeq X customers. And as we do with all major, especially high-throughput launches, we spend a lot of time understanding the drivers of demand for the new platforms and we released new platforms when we feel that we are about to tap into sort of the next wave of elasticity.","And so as we got into the NovaSeq wave, what we heard from customers very clearly was that with the power that they would have access to it, NovaSeq. And you remember, for a lot of these customers who were HiSeq customers that haven\u2019t bought the Xs. So, the 800 HiSeq customers that were outside the 35-plus X customers, they really haven\u2019t had power \u2013 the access to the power of the X.","So what they\u2019re telling us is, when they got access to NovaSeq, what they would do is, they would be able to drive more sequencing in a number of ways. They\u2019d look at doing larger cohorts, they\u2019d look at doing broader sequencing, so panels to exomes, exomes to genomes and they\u2019d look at doing deeper sequencing. And so that\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s what built the model around NovaSeq and the demand for NovaSeq.","As now we look back sort of a year from having lunched NovaSeq, it\u2019s playing out as we expected. As you heard me talk about at JPMorgan, we\u2019re now seeing examples of customers that are tapping into this elasticity in each of those buckets. We\u2019re seeing customers doing a larger cohorts and they would have planned. We\u2019re seeing customers doing much deeper sequencing, especially in areas like liquid biopsy, but other areas of oncology, too, and then we\u2019re seeing customers doing broader sequencing.","If you look at projects, for example, like the consortium with Regeneron announced in terms of sequencing the UK Biobank, that\u2019s the kind of project that really is made available through NovaSeq, that frankly wouldn\u2019t have happened on the HiSeq. And so in each of those categories now, we have examples that NovaSeq is delivering on the elasticity of that market.","Doug Schenkel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And this one is a bit quicker. Based on your installed base disclosures the last couple of years, it looks like you maybe retired only about 100 HiSeq and HiSeq access in 2017, or at least, something in that ballpark. This is far less than what you retired the year before. Again, assuming my math is right here, why did the pace of retirements moderate in 2017, and maybe more importantly, looking ahead to 2018? What is your expectation for HiSeq and HiSeq X replacements that you embedded into full-year guidance? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Sure. So in Q4 itself, we added another 20 \u2013 about 20, sorry, HiSeqs that we retired from the installed base and we didn\u2019t actually take out any Xs in the installed base from Q4. So I think, that adds to the numbers you\u2019ve heard from the rest of the year.","As we were thinking about the upgrade cycle and the pace of retirements and transitions from the HiSeqs and the Xs, this really is a three to five-year upgrade cycle. And the way we sort of measured it out, as we said in the first years of 2017, the focus was really on the HiSeq customers not the X customers. And the focus on the HiSeq customer base was to get them comfortable in the higher utilization HiSeq customers get them comfortable with the NovaSeqs get them starting to validate their workflows in the NovSeqs.","And so the way it showed up in demand for us in 2017 was certainly I talked about in Q3, especially we saw lots of orders that were onesie-twosie. And those were driven by some of the higher throughput chops looking at NovaSeq and starting to get comfortable with the workflow in NovaSeq, as well as and some of the smaller labs that we\u2019re looking to upgrade.","We expect the bigger part of the transition to happen starting this year, driven by two things. One, some of those HiSeq customers are going to start to move more of their workload onto NovaSeqs. And so you\u2019ll start to see more instruments being retired as we go through 2018.","And then, as you know, we launched the S4 in Q4. And so the intent was always 2018 was the year for X customers to start their transition to NovaSeq. And so you should start to see Xs start to be taken out of commission this year going forward. And so that\u2019s what led to the lower retirements \u2013 part contributor to the lower retirements of those instruments in 2017.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Ross Muken from Evercore.","Francis deSouza","Hi, Ross.","Ross Muken","Good afternoon, guys, and congrats on a fantastic quarter.","Francis deSouza","Thank you.","Ross Muken","As we think about your conversation with your customer base around the NovaSeq from an application perspective, it seems like the size and the scope of the types of studies one would want to do and sort of even things that a few years ago were kind of envisioned as impossible or being made possible obviously by the ramp in the technology. And sort of now that we\u2019ve had sometime where this has been introducing with the S4 out in particular. What are the types of discussions you\u2019re seeing globally in terms of some of these newer projects?","So I assume some of things coming to market now were probably derived 12, 24 months ago. And so, we will probably see some of the newer studies, or new scopes studies come over the next few years. So just help us understand how that has changed and how folks after they\u2019ve had a time to understand what\u2019s possible and what they can do with \u2013 particularly with the S4 or how they\u2019re planning?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So let me start by saying, look, some of the things that you heard about last year the \u2013 I talked about Regeneron, but the work that GRAIL was doing, for example. Those sides of studies have been fundamentally enabled by having access to the power of NovaSeq.","Now, if I look back at some of the new customers and new applications, and I think, you touched on globally that are being enabled. Let me give you some examples, right? So we saw, for example, a new service lab customer in Eastern Europe that purchased the NovaSeq and is planning to establish whole genome, whole exome pipeline for genetic disease testing.","We saw large Canadian University that\u2019s going to use NovaSeq for population genetics and repatriating clinical exomes. We saw a benchtop customer that\u2019s working to develop ctDNA technology used for early cancer screening. And they moved to NovaSeq considering the sequencing cost and the higher throughput that they would need for that application.","We also saw, for example, a couple of benchtop customers that originally were HiSeq 3,000, 4,000 opportunities that purchased NovaSeq. To your point, that\u2019s an opportunity that\u2019s been percolating for awhile. But then really what got it over the line was, when they saw NovaSeq and what it would do for them.","We also saw a new customer, which is a recently opened cancer center that wants to do whole genome sequencing or high-throughput exome for NovaSeq. So globally, those are examples of new applications, new customers that have been enabled because of NovaSeq.","Ross Muken","No, that\u2019s super helpful color. And I guess, just maybe in terms of how much of this outperformance you\u2019re sort of willing to drop through? I mean, this quarter, obviously, a big uptick in gross margins, but also OpEx was held pretty tight. What I think is kind of implied in the guide, it\u2019s a little bit more reinvestment.","I mean, how do you think about, particularly on the R&D line, where incremental dollars are being allocated just, because you\u2019ve obviously got such a great presence in your space and there\u2019s so many dynamic opportunities, it seems like your R&D budgets already quite sizable. But considering some of the opportunities ahead of you, there\u2019s still lot to invest. And how are you sort of balancing that and what you\u2019re willing to kind of show on the dropdown?","Francis deSouza","That\u2019s a really good point, Ross, because we spend a lot of time internally and have just gone through a few month process, where we were sort of laying out our three to five-year strategic plan. And the reality of the opportunity facing us and where we are in that opportunity is that, there is a lot more that we could go after than we want to go after then frankly, we\u2019ll be able to go after.","And so a big part of our strategic planning process is to be very thoughtful about, okay, what are the opportunities we actually want to go after? What are the opportunities we want to go after ourselves? And then how do we enable the rest of the opportunity to develop maybe through a partner ecosystem, through things like the accelerator and ventures. And obviously, we don\u2019t talk about the things that we have in development.","But you\u2019ve noted, we have a commitment to innovation in R&D. And we think that there is opportunity in continuing to expand the market through innovation, through innovation and improving the workloads and improving the cost of sequencing. There\u2019s opportunity for innovation and delivering in targeted areas the sample to answer solutions that we talked about. There\u2019s opportunity from continuing to get our products cleared in markets around the world.","And then the other area we\u2019re looking to expand is, we believe that it will be money well spent to continue to expand our commercial infrastructure. That means feet in the ground, especially in growing markets like China, that means our \u2013 continuing to invest in our infrastructure like our digital and e-commerce capabilities, that also means expanding our partner ecosystem. And so, those are some of the things that we consider \u2013 the kinds of things that we consider as we prioritize our investments.","But we truly believe, again, we\u2019re still at the very early stages in almost every market we\u2019re in of this very large opportunity in front of us. And so the hard thinking is, what do you invest and when?","Ross Muken","Super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Dan Arias from CGI. Your line is open.","Daniel Arias","Yes. Hi, guys, thank you.","Francis deSouza","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Arias","Francis, just on the instrument side, I mean, we can kind of talk to how much of the NovaSeq customer base has placed a multi-system order, but is still kind of waiting for a portion of that order. It seems like there\u2019s a good number of labs that have machines, but they don\u2019t have everything that they bought, and that maybe that\u2019s a meaningful part of the placement dynamic this year. Do you agree with that? And if so, is that something that maybe you can put numbers around?","Francis deSouza","It\u2019s definitely a part of the dynamic. If I look at, the \u2013 certainly, the large genome centers, the X shops. The majority of them have purchased, at least, one NovaSeq. But for most of them, the actual both delivery and then replatforming is still in front of us. Some of that will happen in 2018, some of them will start delivering additional units even in Q1 and then we will work over the course of the year to move more of their workloads on to NovaSeq. But that\u2019s a dynamic that will play out not just this year, it will play out next year and the following years as well.","That dynamic is definitely a factor in our backlog. So as we walked into 2018, if I look at the NovaSeq backlog we\u2019re carrying, definitely, the remaining units of a multi-unit order from a large genome center. So that category makes up a chunk of the backlog we\u2019re walking into 2018 with.","But if I look at overall NovaSeq for this year, a large number of the orders are still going to come from that onesie-twosie orders from the customers \u2013 the HiSeq customers that are moving to NovaSeq. So if you look at the order profile over the year, I\u2019d say, a bigger chunk of it is coming from the HiSeq customers, not the X customers. But if I look at the backlog we\u2019re walking to 2018 with, there\u2019s more of the X remaining units to be delivered in there.","Daniel Arias","Yes. Okay, that\u2019s great. And then maybe just on NIPT, curious about your sense for the capacity needs of labs there, if you do take a big step forward on volumes and then to the extent that that does impact system demand. How much do you think goes to the NextSeq versus the NovaSeq?","Francis deSouza","Yes. I definitely think that the NIPT segment will see a continued growth in demand and mostly because of two things. One, the continued growth in reimbursement around the world and we talked about how that\u2019s building, especially globally built nicely over 2017 and we\u2019ll start to see that play out in 2018.","In that segment, the first area that we see impacted is consumable growth. And so, the first thing you\u2019ll see as, you start to see NIPT reimbursement expand as we should see that show up in our consumable revenue. And then, obviously, they continue to add systems as well as, as they need more capacity. That is primarily a NextSeq business, I\u2019d say. And so if you start to think about where it shows up in terms of instruments, say, today, it\u2019s primary sort of NextSeq.","Daniel Arias","Super. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Tycho Peterson. Your line is open.","Francis deSouza","Hi, Tycho.","Tycho Peterson","Hey, thanks. Francis, I appreciate all the color on \u2013 in NovaSeq. I\u2019ve just got one or two clarifications. Now that you\u2019ve got the Xp Sample Prep out and the S4 chip. Can you give us a sense of how much of the funnel incorporates the Xp device? I\u2019m just wondering on kind of some of these larger multi-system orders? And then separately, how do we think about the S1 launch driving Nova demand? I mean, these are really for kind of newer to high throughput sequencing and benchtop customers that you\u2019re trying to upgrade, is that the right way to think about it?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So let me start with S1, and that\u2019s exactly is. So S1 is really targeting the HiSeq customers that have either the lower sample volume. They\u2019re the ones that are most attracted to S1. And for them, that could be the trigger that causes them to start to look at moving from HiSeqs to the S1.","But it\u2019s also going to be customers that won the fast turnaround time. As you remember, from our HiSeq customer base, there was a group for which a rapid turnaround was a key criteria. And so, S1 does appeal to that segment of the HiSeq customer base, too.","We think that is a segment that some of them were waiting for an S1, because that\u2019s what makes the most economic sense for their business model. I think, Xp is helpful to this market, and there are definitely customers who needed it for their workflow and the way they ran their business was they were doing. In some cases, if they were a service lab, they were doing one lab per customer, one lab for genome. And so the Xp workflow does help them with their business.","I think, it\u2019s going to be incrementally helpful. I think, we\u2019re going to call out sort of the attach rate or how many of those units we sell. But it definitely is helpful in terms of having NovaSeq embedded into the workflow some of our \u2013 certainly some of our larger service customers.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And then if we think about iSeq, is MiSeq a good proxy? I know, you talked about having 600 MiSeqs out there, and how we think about cannibalization and maybe where MiSeq fits in going forward?","Francis deSouza","Yes, I think, it\u2019s somewhat of a proxy. I think, though, it\u2019s not a great proxy, because in \u2013 if you look at genomics, there\u2019s a pretty big difference between iSeq and MiSeq, right? So, iSeq is $20,000, MiSeq is 2.5 times as much as $50,000. But MiSeq is 2.5 times as expensive, but it delivers six times the output. It delivers six times the number of reads per run.","And so if you have the capital, if you have the sample volume, you would go for MiSeq. And so, I think, it\u2019s really targeted at customers that are saying, look, a $50,00 instrument is just out of reach for our lab, or they just don\u2019t have the sample volume to warrant even a MiSeq. And so, I really think of it as opening up a different segment. And I \u2013 and there may be some cannibalization, but I don\u2019t expect there will be a lot of cannibalization.","And in that sense, there\u2019s a bit of analogy, where we didn\u2019t end up seeing MiSeq cannibalize the iSeq, we thought maybe up to 25% and they end up not being that at all, and I think maybe that that\u2019s similar.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. And if I could just ask one last one. Can you comment on what\u2019s baked into guidance for arrays, given the inflection you saw in samples last year, could arrays be up 20% again, this year, or how should we think about it?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So, I would say, it\u2019s is in line with overall guidance, Tycho. So basically, building some of the very strong demand and growth that we saw in 2017, and I would say, we would expect the same trends in 2018 as well.","Tycho Peterson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question in the queue comes from Derik de Bruin. Your line is open.","Derik de Bruin","Hi, good afternoon, everyone.","Francis deSouza","Hi, Derik.","Derik de Bruin","Hey, when you look at the overall instrument number for 2018, when you think about the revenue number, it\u2019s like, do you expect total revenues for instruments to be up in 2018? Because I\u2019m trying just \u2013 trying sort of the follow-up on Tycho\u2019s question. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, sort of like the underlying demand for the MiSeq and the NextSeq as you sort of look at that? And what\u2019s sort of the ASP are you looking at for, or are using for your calculations on the Nova?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So, Derik, I\u2019ll talk about the instrument demand for 2018 or what\u2019s basically embedded in guidance. So, obviously, we gave you the the NovaSeq shipment expectations for 2018, so that\u2019s self-explanatory there. So we do expect growth in placements of NovaSeq.","Derik de Bruin","Yes.","Francis deSouza","We also expect growth in placements across really all of our instrument platforms with the notable exception being the HiSeq family of instruments. And for \u2013 iSeq is also going to be a tailwind driven by the fact that it\u2019s a new product introduction. So, and \u2013 basically and someway, we do expect growth in the instruments line for 2018.","Derik de Bruin","Great, that\u2019s helpful. On the \u2013 is there anything embedded in terms of for GRAIL, I mean, you caught out, Helix. I assume that Helix is in a DNA \u2013 is Helix being recorded in a DNA sequencing services line?","Francis deSouza","Helix essentially shows up across our revenues and shows up across our whole income statement, and then we essentially record a noncontrolling interest adjustment when we\u2019re calculating the effect on EPS.","Derik de Bruin","And for GRAIL, I mean, the \u2013 and maybe are you shipping instruments to GRAIL right now as part of that the ramp up in placement for this year?","Francis deSouza","So the way it works, GRAIL is just like any other customer of ours, right, a great customer and a large customer, but like any other customer. So as they need additional capacity, they buy instruments from us and they buy consumables from us. So we talked about the fact that, they were one of our larger customers last year, and we expect them to continue to be a big customer of ours going forward. We don\u2019t share specifics about what instruments are buying when obviously.","Derik de Bruin","Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Francis deSouza","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Steve Beuchaw","Hi, this is Steve Beuchaw in for Steve Buckchaw. [ph] Thanks for taking the question. I wonder, Sam or Francis, if you could give us just a little bit more modeling help with the trend on sequencing consumables that you anticipate for 2018? Any sense for the distribution first-half versus second-half, does it look \u2013 I mean, 2017 was a little unusual, given the first-half destocking dynamics. What is the growth rate for sequencing consumables look like in 2018, and any view on distribution would be super helpful?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So, Steve, we\u2019re not going to give a specific number in terms of sequencing consumables growth. But I\u2019ll give you some of the underlying drivers at a high-level. So we do expect growth over the course of 2018 in terms of overall sequencing consumables versus 2017. That growth is going to be driven by the NovaSeq update and by also growth across NextSeq and other platforms as well.","Again, with the exception being that, HiSeq, we do expect across the HiSeq family to see a reduction in terms of the overall consumable dollars across HiSeq. But that\u2019s going to play out there now. I would say, over time, it\u2019s going to be fairly choppy. So, there\u2019s going to be some, I would say, fluctuation over the course of the quarter.","So I\u2019m not going to give you a specific number in terms of what to expect for each quarter. There will be seasonality though mostly in Q1. And so you will see a lower sequencing consumable number in Q1 driven by seasonality. But across the course of the year, you will see growth.","Steve Beuchaw","Okay. And then just two housekeeping items for me, one, apologize if I missed this. But could you give us the \u2013 or give any sense directionally for the NovaSeq order number in the fourth quarter? Did we get a step up there relative to third quarter? And then any commentary on China, given the growth commentary there just thinking through the drivers would be really helpful? And I\u2019ll get back in queue there. Thanks, again.","Sam Samad","Yes, for orders, Steve, we\u2019re not providing order information anymore as we had mentioned last quarter, so won\u2019t give you much there. But in terms of China, we had 12% growth in terms of shipments in Q4, as I mentioned, and this was lower than the Q3 number that we have reported. But China is essentially choppy as well in terms of overall growth driven by sometimes the timing of instrument placement. So back in Q2, I believe, we had in the mid-teens of growth, so it\u2019s fairly in line with what we saw in Q2, but a step down from Q3.","Francis deSouza","Yes. And then what we said, Steve, in terms of NovaSeq shipments, so we said that, in Q4, we shipped in the high 80s NovaSeq unit, and that was the highest we\u2019ve shipped of any quarter over the course of the year. So you can see that\u2019s continuing to build.","Steve Beuchaw","Thanks, again.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Patrick Donnelly with Goldman Sachs.","Patrick Donnelly","Thanks, guys. Can you provide any color on the utilization mix of the NovaSeq customers as you continue to see new sequencing customers make up about a third of the customer base. Is it a wider range for pull-through between low utilization and high ones compared to prior systems? I guess, I\u2019m just curious if the new sequencing customers are meaningfully lower than kind of the existing customers who buy them?","Francis deSouza","The trend is not frankly, in my opinion, very different than what we saw before. And so what happens is and we saw this with the X and what we see is the first customers who come on Board certainly what\u2019s true with the X, too, are higher-utilization customers. So they\u2019re the ones that, they understand sequencing. They typically had been using another high throughput platform before.","And so the first few instruments, you see utilization that\u2019s extraordinarily high, and then you start to see from the newer to sequencing customers come on. And so,. initially, you see a little bit by model and then very quickly it sort of normalizes to almost aligned, not quite aligned, but almost aligned where people will come in and they\u2019ll start to build up their pull-through on the instrument and work their way up that line.","And so, we\u2019re still \u2013 we\u2019re seeing that with NovaSeq. We know with experience now that, it will still take maybe a couple more quarters before the \u2013 that cohort settles down to a more normalized state, where we can call up pull-through that you guys can use to model.","Patrick Donnelly","Okay, helpful. And then maybe just on the balance sheet and cash continues to build, now you guys are over $2 billion in cash. How should we think about the capital deployment strategy? I mean, maybe just talk about the pipeline, the assets that are out there and what makes sense to add to the portfolio here?","Sam Samad","Yes. So I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll just say that, our capital deployment philosophy hasn\u2019t really changed. We remain very focused on. First of all, we need to invest in our capabilities. We need to invest in potential improvements to our technology, be it through partnerships, or other opportunities that we have.","And then, in terms of other opportunities out there, obviously, hard to comment. I\u2019ll give you specifics there, but they need to essentially be aligned with our strategic priorities and focus and be also accretive to us from an overall growth standpoint. So nothing really has changed materially from what we\u2019ve discussed before. It really remains focused on how do we improve our technology, how do we upgrade our technology and look for partnerships in that space as well.","And then finally, on a probably less material note, we also continue to focus on offsetting any equity dilution with the share repurchases as we did in Q4 when we bought back some shares.","Francis deSouza","Yes, and if I could just sort of underline what Sam said. Look, our top priority continues to be organic innovation to accelerate the market. And so, we\u2019re doing a lot of work there. But I mean, frankly, I think, it\u2019s almost every six weeks, the leadership team meet and we review what\u2019s happening outside Illumina. And we review the landscape to see if there are innovations that we think would be better as part of Illumina, and we\u2019ve done this for many years now.","And so, we are very willing as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past to go out and acquire something that we think will be long-term accretive to us. You\u2019ve seen us do technology tuck-ins. You\u2019ve seen us do bigger ones like even way back where there was Verinata or Solexa. Obviously, in the last couple of years, we haven\u2019t seen anything out there that we feel, we had to have, but we are \u2013 we look at it all the time.","Patrick Donnelly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Tim Evans with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Tim Evans","Thank you. Now that we\u2019re at the end of 2017. I was wondering if you might update us on the mix of your consolidated revenue when it comes to clinical translational and research? And what I\u2019m really trying to get out here is, what \u2013 how fast is research growing versus how fast is clinical translational grow? I know, you\u2019ve given us a few pieces here and there. But is there \u2013 could we get a little bit of a higher-level view of that?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So let me give you some top level sort of observations. I\u2019d say that, we \u2013 what we said now is that, if you look at the mix of our business, the clinical part of our business that includes translational is about 45% of our business and that\u2019s up from the high 30s in 2016. So we are continuing to see more of our business come from the clinical markets. That\u2019s clear, because we\u2019re seeing higher growth in those markets, right?","So we talked about the growth rate that we\u2019ve seen in oncology that has been over 20%. As we look at the growth rate, we talked about the growth rate that we see in NIPT. And we also talked about the fact that the clinical markets are also just very much larger over time. And so, they\u2019re growing faster and they are larger over time. So they will be over time the majority of our business. They will represent the majority of our business over time. So we do expect it to tip over the 50% mark over time.","The research markets are going to continue to be an important market for us. They\u2019re important, because one, today they represent over half of our revenues. But also they\u2019re very important customers, because very often everything that shows up in a clinic at some point started in a research lab. And so our research customers represent not only an important source of revenue for us, but they are an important source of thought leadership. They are great customers in terms of helping us think about the direction that our technology needs to evolve.","In terms of growth, we talked about the fact that, overall, the research markets rough and tough are growing in the high single digits is how you should think about it. Now, there\u2019s still an opportunity for us to grow faster than that in the research market to the extent that you\u2019re seeing research dollars moved into genomics research.","And so, in the U.S., for example, it\u2019s been a good sign for us. But you\u2019re starting to see more and more of the NIH agencies take on projects that are genomics projects. It\u2019s not just coming from the NHGRI that you\u2019re starting to see incremental dollars from NHLBI, NCI and a whole bunch of other agencies. And so the extent that you can see more research dollars moving into genomics. There\u2019s a chance to grow faster than the overall research and growth as well.","Tim Evans","Thank you so much for that. Real quick question on tax rate. A lot of moving parts here, and I hear you on the $0.10 from tax reform. But can you just tell us what the tax rate is embedded in the 2018 guide?","Sam Samad","So we haven\u2019t communicated an exact tax rate. All I would tell you is, there are some improvement in the tax rate from 2017 to 2018, driven by the tax reform benefit. But as you said, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. In Q4 of 2017, we actually had a significant benefit related to the mix from foreign earnings driven by consumable and where we manufacture consumables.","We also had some benefit in Q4 related to some release of reserves, what we call, provision to return benefit from prior year return. So that was a one-time benefit in Q4 that at this point of piece, we have a model to repeat in 2018, but there is moving parts. But I would say, just overall, some benefit in 2018 in terms of the total tax rate versus 2017.","Tim Evans","Thank you.","Operator","The next question in the queue comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","William Quirk","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","Francis deSouza","Good afternoon.","Sam Samad","Good afternoon.","William Quirk","I appreciate the color around NIPT expectations for 2018 and the color around the Dutch tender. Francis, I wanted to talk a little bit about, I guess, expectations for the oncology franchise, given that we obviously have some important book label and reimbursement milestones that we crossed in 2017?","Francis deSouza","Sure. Oncology has been a really important story for us as we look at 2017, right? If you look at even just in Q4, oncology testing was up 60% in Q4. And oncology testing, if you look at the whole year, was up 38% over 2016. And so we\u2019re seeing a \u2013 the real emergence in oncology of a number of factors that are driving it. One is just the emergence of liquid biopsy. And so some of our liquid biopsy customers are driving some of the demand that we\u2019re seeing.","But as you pointed out, we\u2019re also seeing a number of trends play out in terms of regulatory approvals, in terms of reimbursements that may not have yet had the impact in 2017. But I think are setting us up well for future growth in oncology. So we talked about the change in guidelines from and reimbursement procedure at Cigna, which we think is a good step in the right direction towards the routine adoption of multi-gene panels.","And as we said, what\u2019s happened there, as Cigna said, that they will reimburse multi-gene test as long as the clinical utility for one of the genes in the test has been established, that\u2019s a good step forward. We talked about the CMS decision, where they\u2019re going to reimburse genomic test for more than just non-small cell lung cancer, but for all solid tumors, which they used to not do before.","We also like what\u2019s happened with both the regulatory decision and also the reimbursement decision around the foundation one test. And so there are number of things that got put into place in 2017, that may not have been responsible for the results in 2017, but we think set us up well for the future.","William Quirk","Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the array business. Given some of the increases in traffic around Ancestry and 23andMe, particularly relating to the Christmas Holiday. I guess, as a little surprised the array consumables went up a little higher than they were. Is there some sort of delay by any chance? And we tend to see, say, Christmas benefit coming in the first quarter as the samples are processed? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. So the way it works and then so two things, I\u2019ll call it. One is just sort of where you would see the results. So the ancestry business really shows up in terms of array services. So it\u2019s not the only thing in there, but it\u2019s one of the bigger things in our array services line. So that\u2019s where you would have seen it not necessarily array consumables. But the other consumer customers we have like 23andMe would be an array consumables.","Now, in terms of how it actually plays out. So, look, the way it plays out in the market is a consumer will buy the kit, and they\u2019ll buy the kit either over Thanksgiving or for Christmas holidays, some of that buying is to be gifted. And so what happens is, the kit is purchased. It shows up as an order for Ancestry or 23andMe and sort of they talk about as orders as they got in Q4.","That kit then as we gifted, the person who receives it has to spin in a tube and send that tube to us before we start to work on it. And therefore, it shows up as revenue for us as array revenue. And so you can see with that process why a Thanksgiving or a Christmas purchase could show up as Q1 or even Q2 revenue for us. And so there\u2019s an actual delay in how that works between what shows up for them and what shows up for us.","Sam Samad","And the last thing, I would just add to Francis\u2019s delineation between ready array revenue shows up or where the consumer revenues shows up. The microarray consumables is not \u2013 also not just consumer business, there\u2019s a lot more other something there as well. So when you\u2019re thinking about growth rate just keep that in mind.","William Quirk","I appreciate all the color. Thank You.","Operator","Thank you. The next question in the queue comes from Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Dan Leonard","Thank you. So just want to press on the NovaSeq ship guidance a little bit. It looks like you\u2019re allowing for a lighter quarterly shipment trend in 2018 than its recent trend. But presumably, you ended the year with a big backlog, you\u2019re manufacturing at full tilt. So you can draw down your backlog. You have the S1 chip, the S4 chip, or S1 soon, S4 chip already, Xp already. So you can open up all the applications. Why couldn\u2019t the NovaSeq shipments be a bit higher than 330 to 350?","Francis deSouza","Sure. So we shipped the last year $285 million, approximately $285 million NovaSeqs. And so the range we\u2019re talking about this year $330 million to $350 million is a step up from last year. But what we said before is, you should think about it as a step up more, because you\u2019re seeing a full-year effect in 2018. And we only \u2013 we were constrained for, at least, the first two quarters of last year.","And so, what we said is, we expect this to be a more measured so upgrade cycle playing out over three to five years, and we\u2019ve done a number of things to make that happen. So shipping the S4 flow cell and the Xp device in Q4 rather than earlier in the year having S1 come out now. And so what we want is and what we\u2019re expecting to see in the market is this more and measured sort of upgrade cycle that plays out over the three to five-year period.","So, yes, you will see more shipments this year at $330 million to $350 million than you saw last year approximately $285 million. But again, think about of it as more of a full-year effects rather than we do not want to see a pop and then sort of a decline.","Dan Leonard","Okay. And then, Francis, for my follow-up, a year into the NovaSeq launch, do you have any better sense of what the swap ratio looks like some 1,900 HiSeqs could convert to what number of NovaSeqs?","Francis deSouza","Yes, what we said before, and I think it\u2019s even more true than it was last year. The way we think about it is not the number of instruments back, so we don\u2019t think about it as an instrument swap ratio. We think about it as number of customers out. So, you can start with about 1,850 HiSeq and HiSeq X customers and work out, and say, look, some of them, certainly, some of the HiSeq customers may go to NextSeq, but the majority of them will go to NovaSeq. And certainly on the X customers, they will go to NovaSeq, right?","So, the way we\u2019ve thought about it and now that I\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking to customers, I think, it is the right way to think about it is really start from number of customers out assuming that, the majority of them will purchase, at least, one and likely more than one. And the reason for that is, when customers think about purchasing the NovaSeq, their demand profile isn\u2019t static, right?","So as they start to think about a NovaSeq, they start to think about what else they could do. I mean, Regeneron is the perfect example, right? So, they took on the 500,000 samples UK Biobank project and said they could get it done by 2019. But it\u2019s not something they would have done on their HiSeq.","And so, as we have those conversations, the dynamic happening there is that the demand profile changes, in many cases, as they start to think about where NovaSeq allows them to do. And so taking the old demand and then trying to figure out what capacity of NovaSeqs they\u2019ll need would get you to the wrong answer.","Dan Leonard","Okay. I appreciate those thoughts. Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Yes.","Operator","We have time for one more question in the queue, and it comes from Sung Ji Nam. Your line is open from BTIG.","Sung Ji Nam","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just one kind of a two-part question on microarray \u2013 on microarrays. You guys showed the inflection point for the consumer genomics in terms of the volume, the sample volume in 2017. And was curious as to what \u2013 from your standpoint, what\u2019s driving that? Is that kind of more consumer genomics providers entering the market, or is it just kind of curious as to \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to get a better sense of where this could go?","And then also, I think, Sam alluded to other areas \u2013 other applications within microarray is also driving growth for that business. And if you could provide more color, in the past you talked about add Bio, et cetera, so if you could provide more color there as well? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Yes, sure. I think, one of the biggest factors that\u2019s driving this inflection point we saw last year is the elasticity in the market. And we talked about elasticity a lot at Illumina and we talked about the elasticity in the oncology market and NIPT, and it\u2019s very true in the consumer market, too.","If you talk to the leading players in the space, 23andMe and Ancestry, they\u2019ll tell you. And I don\u2019t know if you heard Ann speak at JPMorgan. She has a terrific story about just the huge spike in demand she saw when the 23andMe raised lowered the prices of their kids. And she will talk about when they went from about $150 to $100 a test, in some cases, now $50 a test. It opens up a fast demand for them.","And so probably the biggest thing that drove the inflection point last year was that the tests reached prices, the $99 mark, and in some cases over the Black Friday weekend, the $50 mark that that really capped into this elasticity of demand in the consumer market. I think, that\u2019s simply the biggest like. There are a number of entrants in that market. But in the U.S., I think, it\u2019s primarily Ancestry, 23andMe and then maybe Family Tree DNA a little further behind there sort of the big players. So it\u2019s not that you have many more entrants in the space. It\u2019s just that you have price points now that are really attractive to customers.","Now Helix allows more experimentation in that space. And so, the players that I talked about are all targeting the genealogy space, and that\u2019s emerged as the first killer application in consumer genomics. What Helix allows us to do as a market is pretty test all the other markets, right, with the wellness market, the nutrition market, the fitness market and see what\u2019s the next killer application in consumer genomics beyond genealogy.","Sung Ji Nam","Great. And then a bit more color on kind of other applications where you might be seeing a lot of growth as well?","Francis deSouza","Yes. So as Sam touched on it. If you look at the numbers we report, we reported an array services line. And there, the majority of it is the consumer genomic space. And so, they \u2013 that business does drive the growth rate of that line. If you look at array consumable line, there are a number of other segments that show up in the line. So our ag business, our agriculture business, for example, shows up in that line.","And so while that\u2019s an important segment, it\u2019s growing at a much lower rate than the consumer genomics, right? So if you look at the blended growth rate in array consumables, you\u2019ll end up with something in the single digits, because the majority of that line is actually not consumer genomics.","Sung Ji Nam","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you.

During the section of today's call, I will review our first quarter financial results and our guidance for the remainder of the year. I will then turn the call back to Jay to provide an update on our commercial progress and the state of our business and markets. ","We've gotten off to a really strong start in 2012. In Q1, we had record orders for both MiSeq instruments and sequencing consumables. All 3 geographic regions beat their order forecast, and we built backlog for the third consecutive quarter. ","First quarter 2012 revenue of $273 million increased 9% sequentially due to another successful quarter of MiSeq shipments, microarray growth and growth in sequencing consumables. Revenue for the quarter decreased 3% compared to Q1 2011, as the year ago quarter included a significant number of HiSeq shipments associated with our Genome Analyzer trade-in program. ","Instrument revenue for the first quarter was $80 million, essentially flat sequentially and down 30% year-over-year, again due to the Genome Analyzer trade-in program and the decrease in microarray instrumentation. ","Consumable revenue for the quarter was $173 million, up 20% sequentially and up 17% compared to the first quarter of 2011. I'm very pleased with sequencing consumable revenue in the quarter, the result of both a larger installed base and a sequentially improved average annualized quarter on HiSeqs. HiSeq consumables, while still only in their second full quarter of shipment, are also beginning to ramp up. In addition, increased shipments from our Infinium microarrays, most notably our exome family of products, contributed to consumable revenue growth.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, was $17 million for the quarter compared to $16 million in Q1 of last year. ","Now a discussion of gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude noncash stock compensation expense, restructuring charges and other noncash items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release. ","Our adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 69%. This compares to 70.2% last quarter and 68.2% in the first quarter of 2011. The sequential decline was attributable to the onetime catch-up benefit mentioned last quarter, which resulted from improvements in HiSeq reliability. The year-over-year gross margin increase was driven by a favorable mix of consumable versus instrument revenue and higher ASPs on the HiSeq 2000 as the Genome Analyzer trade-in program negatively impacted the ASP in Q1 2011. ","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $41 million or 14.9% of revenue compared to 15% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 14.5% of revenue in the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted SG&A expenses were $52 million or 18.9% of revenue in the quarter compared to 20.1% of revenue in the fourth quarter and 18.5% of revenue in the first quarter of 2011. ","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34%, which reflects a higher rate than we expect for the year as the R&D tax credit legislation has not yet been passed for 2012. This compares to 35.2% in the first quarter of last year. We anticipate this current tax rate will continue until passage of the R&D tax credit legislation by Congress, probably later this year. If passed, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate will drop accordingly as the full affect of the credit is applied to the time for the entire year. ","Non-GAAP net income was $48 million for the quarter, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.36. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $50 million and $0.35, respectively, in the first quarter of 2011. The reported GAAP net income of $26 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the quarter compared to $24 million or $0.16 per diluted share in the prior year period. ","In the fourth quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $65 million. We used approximately $13 million for capital expenditures, resulting in $52 million of free cash flow. This compares to $81 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter of last year and $76 million in the prior year. DSO increased slightly to 67 days compared to 63 days last quarter and 59 days last year due to the timing of shipments in the quarter, as well as a greater proportion of revenue outside of the U.S. Our over 90-day balances remain negligible. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and short-term investments. ","Given our significant cash balance and our confidence in the business, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $250 million of outstanding shares, which we will affect via a combination of 10b5-1 and discretionary share repurchase program.","Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance in Q1. While some uncertainty exists with respect to academic and research funding in the second half of the year, we have built backlog for the third consecutive quarter and our full year outlook is generally as we anticipated. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our 2012 guidance. ","At this point, I will turn the call over to Jay for some remarks on our commercial activity during the quarter before we begin the Q&A session.","Jay T. Flatley","Thanks, Marc. We are very pleased with our Q1 results, particularly given the potential distraction of the Roche tender offer. I would like to thank our shareholders for their continuing strong support and reaffirm our commitment to generation of shareholder value. ","The positive trends we saw in Q4 continued in the first quarter as both microarray and sequencing revenue grew sequentially, and we grew EPS both sequentially and year-over-year. Overall, we feel the current global funding environment is stable. We're seeing more traditional buying patterns in the U.S., Europe is growing and Asia is particularly strong, with Japan exhibiting a funding and business resurgence. ","As we look toward the potential U.S. funding issues in the second half of the year, we remain cautious. While there's no clarity on sequestration and the NIH budget for 2013 remains uncertain, we continue to expect that a dramatic 8% reduction is an unlikely scenario. We've considered the range of potential budget outcomes in formulating our annual guidance, and we believe the overall funding dynamics this year are considerably more favorable than last year. ","To remind you, last year the uncertainty in academic spending was broader geographically and potentially affected both fiscal year 2012 and 2013, while we believe U.S. researchers currently anticipate funding uncertainty over only a 3- or 4-month period until a budget deal can be reached after the U.S. elections. ","Our top U.S. Genome Centers are not facing additional budget cuts as they did in Q3 last year and given that they're at the beginning of their 4-year budget cycle, we do not expect these customers to be appreciably impacted in the back half. ","Additionally, a new large Genome Center is expected to start taking shipments later this year. And finally some customers, in order to avoid a recent sequencing consumable price increase, have placed orders for consumables to be shipped throughout the year, improving our forecasting and allowing greater manufacturing efficiency. With our growing backlog, improved forecast visibility and fewer funding dynamics at play, we believe that we're in a considerably more favorable position this year relative to last. ","Let me turn now to the specific results of the quarter. Q1 was another great quarter for orders with a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.1 and all regions exceeding their order forecast. From a shipment perspective, all 3 geographic regions were up sequentially with the strongest growth in Asia-Pac, up more than 20%. For the first time in our history, Asia finished with higher revenue than Europe with notable strength in Japan. We had record sequencing orders driven by MiSeq, core consumables and sample prep. ","In the array business, total microarray revenue was down slightly year-over-year, primarily as a result of lower instrumentation shipment. This quarter marked the highest number of Infinium samples we have ever shipped. We received orders for approximately 300,000 more exome samples, bringing total samples order to date to approximately 1.3 million, by far the highest number of samples for any content collection in the company's history. ","In addition, Q1 marked record samples ordered for our Infinium CytoSNP array and record shipments of our methylation arrays. Turning to our sequencing business, total sequencing revenue in Q1 grew double digits sequentially, attributable to growing sequencing consumables and a significant number of MiSeq shipments. Total sequencing consumable revenue grew 20% compared to Q1 of last year. Both HiSeq and GA consumable shipments and average pull-through increased sequentially. Given our installed base, sequencing consumable shipments have now become the largest source of sequencing revenue for the company. ","TruSeq sample prep shipments were at a record level and grew 17% sequentially and 35% over the prior year, demonstrating our focus on back integrating in the sample prep. Average annualized consumable utilization of HiSeqs increased to $299,000 in Q1 from $273,000 in Q4, and we have several reasons to believe this trend can continue. We will be benefiting from a nominal price increase in early Q2. HiSeq utilization trends in the U.S. and Asia Pacific are positive. Sequencing consumable orders grew 33% sequentially over Q4, which itself was a record quarter, and our TruSeq Exome Enrichment pricing will continue to improve utilization. ","Earlier this year, we announced the HiSeq 2500 and 1500 multimode instruments. In rapid mode, the HiSeq 2500 is capable of running a genome in a day, up to 20 exomes in a day or up to 30 RNA-Seq samples in 5 hours. We've been pleased with the orders received to date, both for upgrades of existing HiSeqs and orders for the new instrument. We remain on track for launch in the second half of 2012. ","We're also very pleased with the market penetration of MiSeq in its second full quarter of shipments. Customer feedback continues to be very positive as this instrument fits nicely into academic research labs as well as diagnostic applied, commercial and clinical settings. ","We believe we achieved leading market share in the desktop sequencing market in Q1. In addition, we have seen no material impact from recent competitive announcements. We remain on track to ship the upgraded version of MiSeq this summer, with both higher and lower throughput kits. ","This new version of MiSeq can achieve up to 7G per run and is ideally suited for running deep coverage targeted cancer panels such as the recently announced TruSeq Amplicon - Cancer Panel, a highly multiplex product allowing accurate sequencing of hundreds of the most relevant cancer loci even in difficult samples such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors. With the ability to detect mutations below 5% frequency, the TruSeq Amplicon assay provides the market highest-quality data across many samples all in one experiment. ","We began active discussions with approximately 100 clinical customers interested in using MiSeq for diagnostic applications. Greater than half the orders for MiSeq are now from nonacademics, unlike HiSeq which is predominantly ordered by academic customers. ","Finally, we remain on track to submit the MiSeq platform to the FDA for 510(k) approval before year end. ","In our FastTrack Services business, we are pleased The Broad Institute joined the Illumina Genome Network to offer us proprietary sample prep process for challenging low input and FFPE samples. Starting this quarter, IGN will begin to offer several premium service products using the fast turnaround capability of the HiSeq 2500, coupled with enhanced sample prep and new informatics software. IGN has also launched the new Cancer Analysis Service, which leverages the high accuracy of Illumina technologies to provide cancer researchers with the most accurate data while using the lowest sample input of any commercial whole-genome sequencing service. ","This new service uses a new variant color, which after mapping the tumor in normal sample to the references, uniquely combines the data sets to better model somatic variants even with varying levels of tumor purity. IGN's combined calling method recovers 97% of known single nucleotide variants compared to 77% in competing services. ","In addition to our Cancer Analysis Services, we're working with leading data analysis and visualization companies including Diagnomics, Ingenuity and Knome to provide optimized software tools for downstream filtering and interrogation of IGN data sets with a goal of delivering biologically relevant and actionable results. These data sets can also be integrated with the results of follow-on sequencing, genotyping and RNA-Seq studies performed to help researchers better understand cancer and the associated biological pathways. ","We believe clinical sequencing is nearing an inflection point. Accordingly, we've been working diligently to accelerate and automate the complete end-to-end workflow required for clinical customers. In sample prep new methods like FFPE, low input and our PCR-free protocols increase the breadth of sequence of old sample types and the quality of resulting data. ","To accelerate analysis, we've developed a new software liner called iSelect which offers a 4x to 6x speed increase while reducing the compute requirements from a Linux cluster to a single server. At the same time, we've nearly completed an annotation project which aggregates information for multiple public databases like dbSNP, Ensembl and others that offer a simple push-button analysis for variant detection and efficient clinical interpretation. Combining this with the HiSeq 2500 yields a full workflow allowing clinical genomes to be prepped, sequenced and interpreted in less than 3 days. ","In the coming weeks, we're going to have some very exciting announcements about BaseSpace, Illumina's cloud computing environment. Currently, BaseSpace is supporting a significant part of our growing MiSeq installed base and as previously announced, we're working to integrate HiSeq into BaseSpace by late summer. This will allow researchers to quickly and cost effectively analyze the human genome, ultimately increasing HiSeq sales and growing the BaseSpace community. ","And finally, I'm excited to announce today the availability of our My Genome iPad application in the Apple App Store at a price point of $0.99. This version of the app allows consumers to explore a demo human genome, learn about possible health implications and view reports about important genetic variants. We will shortly release a version that links to our website, allowing customers to download and view their own genome once they have been sequenced via Illumina's position-mediated individual genome sequencing service. ","In conclusion, we're very excited about our product lineup for 2012. We had a strong Q1 and good visibility into the second half of the year given our backlog and product pipeline. We have a focus on strong operational execution and continuous innovation to maintain our technology lead. The clinical market is emerging very rapidly and will be a key story for 2012, and we continue to believe that the overall sequencing market has enormous potential and that we have the technology, people and infrastructure to capitalize on these unique opportunities and to continue to lead this market. Thank you for your time, and we'll now open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Maybe the first one on HiSeq consumables. You got back to around $300,000 per year. Is this the right run rate to kind of think about it going forward? And can you talk a little bit about how much of this is being driven by the commercial partners and how much of it is kind of on a standing order basis as well?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to be able to continue to push that rate up. I mean, we're certainly not committing to forward-looking models at higher than, say, $300,000. But as I mentioned in the script, the trend lines are all looking pretty good, Tycho, and so we're pretty optimistic about our ability to continue to push this. Particularly in places like Asia, we're seeing great uptake for consumables. The overall trends from quarter to quarter look very promising. When you talk about partners, you're referring to who -- which partners in that question?","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sequenom and Genomic Health and some of the commercial partners.","Jay T. Flatley","I see. Sure, yes. In the clinical markets that are clearly emerging now, we think that those customers will have overall very high utilization rates as they get the products into clinical applications, and sequencing is leading the pack there. Obviously, the sequencers that they've purchased from us, their goal would be to utilize them at as high a rate as they possibly can. And so on average, that type of customer will have higher utilization and push the averages up.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know you're able to talk about the percentage of customers that are on kind of standing orders. I guess we've had some questions with the price increase to the extent that maybe demand was pulled forward. If you could address that, that would be helpful.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. What we did there, Tycho, is we had a price increase and we gave customers 2 ways to reduce the impact of that potential price increase on them. The first was if they agree to order through -- place the orders through our e-commerce system, they were able to get about a 50% cut from the number -- from the total increase of the price to them. And if they put a standing order in place that was essentially noncancellable through the rest of the year, then they were able to avoid the price increase altogether. I can't tell you exactly how many customers took advantage of that. Certainly, it was a reasonable number. I guess I'd qualitatively characterize it as a reasonable part of the installed base. But none of those orders counted as revenue in Q1, so there was no impact on what we reported in our $273 million for the quarter. So those orders went into backlog, not into revenue.","Christian O. Henry","I think the one other thing I'd point out, Jay, is that the shelf life of the reagents makes it such that you don't ship any customer a year's worth of demand in front of a price increase. So as Jay pointed out, getting people on routine schedules of deliveries will help me a lot in the operations area to make sure that we hit our forecast and push that gross margin up.","Jay T. Flatley","And both those attempts that we made there were to try to improve the overall organizational efficiency clearly on the ordering side for e-commerce, so we don't have to send sales people in every time we want to get a consumable order. And our ability to forecast through the year in the case of customers putting in standing order gives -- orders -- gives us a much better ability to order raw material and to produce the correct amount of reagents in a given quarter.","Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then last one, can you just touch on Japan, what really drove the strength there? And how do we think about the sustainability of that trend?","Jay T. Flatley","Japan was very, very strong in the quarter. And part of it was, I think, a return to significant incremental funding. So they had a large funding increase last year. I think the projections for this year forward are about 6% incremental funding. So the trend lines in Japan are very positive there. There's probably some onetime tsunami funding that came in to try to, in particular, reinvigorate the economy. And I think there's an overall resurgence in the general focus on genomic research in Japan that we're seeing as well. I'm going to also comment that I think organizationally we're doing very well in Japan. We have strong leadership there and a very solid-built team, so our execution in Japan's been excellent.","Marc Stapley","Jay, one other point, I mean it was the end of the fiscal year, this first quarter in Japan for many of the customers.","Jay T. Flatley","That's right, yes. So where the NIH ends at the end of the September, the Japanese fiscal year ends at the end of Q1.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You guys had a very strong MiSeq and sequencing consumable quarter, as you noted in your prepared remarks. Our check suggests that not all customers could actually get the instruments in the sequencing kits they wanted as quickly as they might have hoped. This is clearly a high-class problem for the company right now, but not one that you would want to last all that long. Can you just talk about how capacity is tracking relative to demand and the progress you expect to make relative to that in the second quarter specifically?","Jay T. Flatley","I'll take the instrument side of that, and I'll let Christian talk about the reagents, Doug. As we entered the quarter, we had still a remaining large backlog of instruments, and the manufacturing team has done a great job of ramping up our instrument manufacturing and we delivered quite a few of those in Q1. And so now I think we'd characterize exiting Q1 that we're getting very close to commercially acceptable lead times and we generally characterize that as about 4 weeks to 6 weeks so that a customer could place an order and expect to be running in their laboratory with that instrument in that window of say 4- to 6-week time frame. So do you want to touch on the reagents, Christian?","Christian O. Henry","Sure. On the reagent side, we have -- the first quarter, we actually had stronger demand than we were originally anticipating. And so as we got through the quarter, we shipped most of our safety stock. And we get into the second quarter, the first part of the second quarter here we've been rebuilding the safety stock, so that slowed some of the shipments in the first week or 2, but really doesn't have an impact on the overall second quarter. One thing that's important to note is the sample prep. As Jay pointed out in his remarks, our sample prep volumes have gone up dramatically in the last quarter or so, and so the complexity of the number of reagents we're making and the consumables that we're shipping has increased and that's also pushed some of the times, the lead times, for people to get sample prep reagents out a little bit. But at the end of the day, as you pointed out, Doug, it's a pretty high-class problem to have because we're capturing market share in the sample prep side that we couldn't before. And on the generic reagent side, we're seeing pull-through higher than we originally anticipated, which I think bodes well for the year.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. So there was a study released in Nature Biotech overnight. Nick Loman was the lead author, and this study compared the performance of various next -- benchtop next-generation sequencers. One metric where the MiSeq was much better than the Roche 454 GS FLX Junior and the Ion Torrent platform was homopolymers. How important do you think this issue is in the clinical end market? Are there instances with customers where you know you're getting competitive wins specifically because of this issue? And given that one of your key competitors has been arguing that SBS chemistry has a more material homopolymer issue, what's the importance in your view of a study like this being published in a peer-reviewed journal such as Nature Biotech?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I haven't actually had a chance to read that yet, Doug, but with respect to homopolymers, SBS performs beautifully in homopolymers because we add a single base at a time, so whether there's a 3-base run or a 23-base run, largely doesn't matter to SBS chemistry. In many of the competing chemistries, after you get out to 3 or 4 bases of the same type, the quality of the efficacy of the call drops precipitously. And so I think we have a significant advantage there. And in some of the core clinical applications, that's exactly what you want to measure is how long is the repeat, and it's particularly informative in particular types of clinical diagnostic tests. So I think that is a major advantage of the platform.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last question, anything you can say specific about the trade-in programs relative to basically the impact it had on the quarter, specifically for PGMs and for Roche boxes?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. We have traded in a number of instruments, and the number of customers that are in the evaluation queue, I would say, of the trade-in potential is growing considerably. So I think as we look forward over the next couple of quarters, we expect that number to grow.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I actually have some questions on the array side of the business, if I may. So you talked to microarray revenue growth. It sounds like the exome array was a big part of that, so I'm curious if that's true. And then just at a high level, how should we be thinking about the array business at this point in terms of growth potential and sort of the dynamics between instrument and consumable sales?","Jay T. Flatley","The exome was certainly a significant part of the growth in the quarter, but we also saw in our methylation arrays good growth there. So I'd say within the family of arrays, we're seeing some strong growth in some and not much in others. I think the way to think about the array business is on the consumable side sort of single-digit type growth rates, and probably the instrument flattish to maybe slightly down over the next year on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Do we have any more visibility into rare variant cue off at this point?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. I can make some comments about that. I think that our conclusion now is that the -- what was generally referred to as the rare variant hypothesis, which the large-scale GWAS chips we're going after, particularly the Omni5. What's been shown there is that statistically, we're going to require a much larger number of samples to make the discoveries that we had hoped to make on products like the Omni5. And while that might be disappointing for that particular chip, it again speaks to the complexity of human biology, and in the long run plays right into the strength of our business because what it means is that you need to bring higher horsepower technologies to make the discoveries. And we suspect that's largely going to be low-pass sequencing. And so we think over the next couple of years, you're going to see a transition of what's traditionally been done on array-based GWAS over to low-pass sequencing, which will have the ability to multiplex lots of samples together and efficiently conduct the equivalent of a GWAS study but have the ability to look at every single variant in the sample as opposed to only those that you preselect and put on an array.","Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then just last one for me, just switching topics a little bit. Just thinking about sequestration and potential NIH cuts. I'm trying to understand how specifically funding cuts would impact your P&L thinking about it in conjunction with sort of normal product cycles, specifically thinking about the HiSeq? Would it impact instrument sales, consumables, just trying to think about those 2 dynamics over the long term.","Jay T. Flatley","We really think about the upcoming concern about funding is really a short-term issue as opposed to long-term issue because I think it's going to largely be flushed out of the system sometime in Q1 of next year and maybe sooner if there's some type of budget agreement that occurs in Q3 or Q4. And so we really do think it's a bump in the road here that we have to deal with. As we said in the script, we've tried to incorporate as much of the potential range of variation in that outcome as we could in our guidance. I suspect if you were looking at the months of September, October, November, it might have a bigger impact on the instruments than it would on consumables, that customers would tend to buy consumables more to run the existing instruments as opposed to buying new ones if I were to try to pick a sort of a directional way that funding might get allocated. As we've continued to mention, we think the minus 8 is an unlikely outcome. I think probably most people are aware that the initial budget that Obama submitted has -- calls for a flat NIH budget, which will be a fantastic outcome for us if it wind up being flat over 2011 -- or 2012, sorry.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, Bank of America.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So when you look at your MiSeqs, how many labs are you selling these into that also have PGM? Or is it -- are you not running into them in competitive landscape? And I guess, are you doing bake-offs in this sense, any way like that? I'm just curious how many people are buying multiple benchtop systems to test drive them?","Jay T. Flatley","We don't have specifics on that in front of us, so what I'm going to give you is a guess about what it might look like. I would say that maybe 25% at most of the customers, maybe a little higher have both platforms. In most of the cases where we're doing head-to-head competition, we feel very strongly about our win rate in those circumstances. I think our challenge is to make sure that we can penetrate more broadly into the market to get at customers that we're not seeing, which is where I think there's some significant wins for PGM.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","How do we think about the MiSeq reagent pull-through? It's one of the biggest variables in my model. Can you give us any guidance on that, on how to think about that?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I can. We're not ready to give our exact estimate yet, and the reason is that the way our math works it tends, in the first couple of quarters of a new product shipment, to overestimate the number. And so we don't want to give that number out for fear that people might lock into that number. We continue to think that $50,000 per year is probably the right number to start with. And I think we're probably one quarter away from being ready to actually say what we think it's going to be in the longer run.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And in the cytogenetics market, you've mentioned some good strength there. How are you -- are you going head-to-head against some of your competitors in that and taking share? I mean, there are 2 other major players in the array market going after that market which seems to be a big growth opportunity, and talk about the competitive dynamics in cyto.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I mean, it certainly is a competitive space. We do have 2 competitors there, both with quality products. And so I think we're just competing effectively in those markets and winning more than our share. We are, as we have mentioned historically, taking our product through the FDA so we're in the process of conducting the clinical trials now and we expect to have that submitted to the FDA before year end. So I think that is a market that's probably more competitive than the other parts of our array business, but we continue to do okay there.","Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Finally, so do we get an R&D day anytime soon?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I wouldn't say at any time soon. I think the earliest we would do it would be some time in the fall. We will be thinking about when the best time is to do it and obviously it will depend on market factors, competitive factors and what's happening with our own platforms, but it's certainly unlikely it would happen before fall.","Operator",".","And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","The company's portion to the diagnostics market, can you provide an update on how Illumina is set up today regarding salespeople and sales specialists to go after this market and what types of investment you'll need to make to successfully commercialize in the diagnostic setting?","Jay T. Flatley","Be happy to. Yes, you have to almost think of the diagnostics market in a couple of different pieces. One of those pieces certainly is the parts of the market where we are partnering, and we are very effective at selling directly into those markets, particularly now with our new TCG business unit that we have a team of people that's focused on the top CLIA labs in the U.S. and outside the U.S. is where the sales effort for companies like Sequenom or Genomic Health would be focused. And we have the ability to work those accounts, they're large OEM opportunities. A partnership like Siemens would fall into that group as well. So I think that segment, we're very well set up today. I think the area where we would need to develop a further infrastructure is when we bring products that are IVD products where we have our own proprietary content. We suspect that we'll be giving you some more information about what we call our Apollo program, which is our cancer-sequencing program sometime in the next 3 months to 6 months, and we'll be talking more about what products we expect to come from that effort. And in that case, this would be selling much more broadly to oncologists and physicians. And in that case, we would need to supplement our distribution and that could be done either by building it ourselves or potentially through an acquisition.","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And then as a follow-up, kind of switch gears, I wanted to ask you a question about emerging markets. Can you just provide some color about your business in China today, maybe across emerging markets? What's the realistic growth rate going forward in EM versus developed markets for Illumina? And any specific color on China would be great.","Jay T. Flatley","Growth rates in developing markets overall?","Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, like emerging markets growth rate for Illumina going forward, say, versus developed markets if you think about it that way or maybe just specifically kind of your business in China, kind of what that position is growing at and kind of what can we expect it to grow at?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, I don't have the specific growth rates of China in front of me, but they're pretty reasonable. I mean obviously, one of our largest customers, BGI, is based in China but we have many, many more customers and significant emerging opportunities there as we begin to push into the clinical market. So we are quite optimistic about China as a growth territory over the next couple of years. We've also had many entities who have come to talk to us about potentially partnering to attack particular segments of the Chinese market, and so I believe you'll probably see us embark on some partnerships in China. In other developing markets like India, I'd say India is not a strong geography for us now. That could change over the next couple of years with lower-priced products and again, a greater focus on clinical applications. But there, I think the lack of ability to buy capital equipment is a particular challenge. In other parts of Asia, I'd say the growth rates are doing pretty well but off a smaller base. If you look at places like Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, we're doing okay in those geographies. We deal largely through distributors there. And those markets are beginning to put more and more funding into genomic research.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Anyways, on the product pipeline, I was wondering if maybe you could offer any color around when we might know a little bit more about chemistry A and B and then remind us maybe on PCR reagents, how you look at your channel strategy there and how you're going to define success?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. With respect to chemistry A and chemistry B, we're not prepared to give any more details today. I think we should be doing our R&D day in the fall. That would be a great time to give you a specific update on the performance of those chemistries and how we expect them to be ultimately brought to fruition. I don't think you'll hear a lot of detail about those chemistries until we're relatively close to actually including them in a product of one sort or another and depending upon how fast the research goes in those various areas will determine when we're ready to bring a product to market that embodies each of those chemistry. With respect to PCR, we will expect to begin to market those reagents around the end of Q2, early Q3. Our focus now in the U.S. is to also bring on some distribution partners, and we are in discussions with distributors about working with us both on the instrument and on reagents in the U.S. And internationally, we're already well set up with a distribution network for both instruments and reagents.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then maybe just a big picture question. You mentioned the funding environment and the range of potential outcomes there. If you could maybe offer some color on how you think your customers, particularly those in the smaller labs in the U.S. and in Europe, have evolved their planning and helped you improve your visibility after the destruction we've seen in the last year, that might be helpful.","Jay T. Flatley","I think our customers are a bit more sophisticated about this, this year than last as we all sort of look back on last year because there are so much uncertainty coming from so many directions. Many of our customers just stopped doing anything for 1 month or 2 and tried to figure out what's going on. They were writing grants, they were trying to deal with stimulus issues. And I don't think that's what we're going to see this year. I think customers are going to sort of meteor out their funds more regularly. They probably already anticipated some potential challenges in Q3 and Q4 and so they're probably spending an appropriate rate. They'll get them through that window much more smoothly. Part of the reason that we don't anticipate anywhere near the impact this year as we saw last year.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one housekeeping item for me on the service revenue. It looked like they slowed down a little bit on an easy comp. Anything specific in there related to timing or pricing that we should note for the model going forward?","Jay T. Flatley","It's not pricing. It really relates to just timing of completion of contracts. As we've always said, I wouldn't actually put it explicitly in the script, but usually we say that there's a broad variation in that number because of the large contracts that we tend to deal with and availability of samples and timing of particular contract completion is the biggest factor in the timing of recognition of those revenues.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","It's actually Dave Clair here for Bill. First question for me, when we reach the $1,000 genome on the HiSeq 2500, what do you expect will be the associated IT costs?","Jay T. Flatley","Associated IT costs?","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. IT.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I mean, I guess part of it depends on whether what you're projecting as a $1,000 genome is inclusive of IT or not inclusive of IT. Many people who talk about the $1,000 genome today are going to have to add IT on top, and I presume that's how you've structured your question. And if it is, I suspect you're talking about somewhere in the range of $500 to $750 to do what we call secondary and tertiary analysis. That doesn't include -- I guess probably in some way it does include all of tertiary analysis because it wouldn't include, trying to understand the fundamental biology of the result or how we compare it against potentially hundreds of other samples that IT caused us to focus on storing and the analyzing a single genome's worth of data.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned that customers choosing standing orders for sequencing consumables, they avoid the price increase that you're passing through all for this year, so at the beginning of next year the price will increase for them as well?","Jay T. Flatley","That's right.","David C. Clair - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And last one from me, what's next for you and Roche?","Jay T. Flatley","We have no idea. So as I think everyone's aware, at the Shareholder Meeting we had last week, the vote went in our direction and so we're pleased with that outcome. And as we've said all along, we're stewards of shareholder value and should an offer to come to us either publicly or privately, we have a responsibility and an obligation to evaluate that as fairly as we can in light of our other opportunities, and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could you, Jay, maybe start by commenting on the instrument pricing dynamic? You gave us some good color on the consumables side, especially when it comes to ASPs on the MiSeq placements in Q1. Could you talk about those a little bit?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. On MiSeq, the pricing held beautifully. So actually, our ASP was slightly higher than our list price which is interesting, and that's all because of international sales and distributor pricing. In some of our international geographies, we actually have a markup built into the list price. So fantastic pricing security, I guess, around MiSeq. I say on the HiSeq systems, not bad either. It's staying pretty flat here over the last couple of quarters. I do suspect, over the next few quarters, it may drift down a little bit.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And the drift down includes both the MiSeq and the HiSeq or would you reference?","Jay T. Flatley","I'm speaking largely about the HiSeq. MiSeq may change a little bit, but not a lot.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And in terms of the opportunity size, you've often sized the MiSeq market as 6,000-odd relatively high throughput CE instruments. Have you seen meaningful convergence there off of the instruments yet or not?","Jay T. Flatley","We've seen some. Many of the CE applications are what we call sort of the turn-the-crank applications where there's specific high-volume usage that are -- we're very dedicated to a particular market. An applied market is a great example of that. And so those will take a little while to displace but in areas like Amplicon sequencing, which is a customized sequencing application we're beginning to see that conversion, particularly with the launch of our new Amplicon kit.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is that 6,000 a good size to think about, Jay?","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, it's a pretty good number.","Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess my last question would be on the HiSeq consumables. How do you see the box to better utilization on the HiSeq? In the past, you've talked about a $3,000 to -- $300,000 to $400,000 per annum consumables pull-through. How do we get to a higher number? And of course, Q3 last year we've seen a dynamic where there weren't enough samples in the system. Has that pretty much resolved itself or is that still a continuing issue?","Jay T. Flatley","We think that's largely flushed out of the system. I think there's a couple of factors that influence utilization. One is the overall funding environment, and that will dictate how many projects particular customers have. If you're an owner of 5 HiSeqs and you get x amount of money, you may be at 50% utilization. If you get 1.4x, you might be pushed up to 80% utilization. So that's a very important factor in the overall utilization rate. The second is the mix of customers. If you look at the instant installation of a HiSeq, in general, it would be a lower utilization customer as a general rule. That's offset, we think, at least partially if not completely, by the fact that some of our clinical customers will be very high utilizers of these instruments. We talked about that a little earlier in the call and I think as we continue to push HiSeqs into those types of applications, that that's going to offset some of the other impacts of decreasing utilization.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jay, in your remarks, you referenced some of the newer things that were shown down at Marco Island. Anything you can offer on commercial utilization time lines versus, say, the PCR-free workflow solutions or maybe even the 400-base reads that you highlighted down there? I realized you still may get the 2 x 2 x 50s into the market, but I'm just sort of curious where some of these longer-range types of incremental technology enhancements stand here.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes. Well, a couple of those are things that are going on in our research organization where we haven't actually made a definitive decision about how to productize them, so we wouldn't have specific dates on those. Christian, do you want to comment on the sample prep?","Christian O. Henry","Sure. Well, on the PCR-free, we're actually starting to use that in the services group right now, and so we'll do some extensive testing of that through our services organization and then create a plan to launch that. In some of the more complicated preps such as the FFP there's protocols out there, but what we really want to do is create kits that make it -- make the workflow a lot simpler. And so you can expect to see those realistically over the first half of next year start to find their way into the market. As far as longer reads go and things like that, those are really just pushing the basic technology forward. And whenever we show those, we try to show how much headroom SBS chemistry has both in read length and cycle time and accuracy, all of the key dimensions. And when we think about going to longer read lengths, let's say, such as the 400-base pairs, those would probably be in lockstep with a new kit that comes out that's the core sample or the core sequencing reagents SBS and clustering reagents. For example, the upgrade on the MiSeq system that will occur a little bit later in the summer will give the capability to do 250-base per reads, whereas before we couldn't do that.","Jay T. Flatley","We very often would couple an increase in read length with an improvement in cycle time because typically our customers wouldn't want to increase the overall time that the instrument runs. This margin will be one thing but if it's significant, we would want to couple it with an improvement in the individual base cycle time so the run time stays practically the same. That's a good point.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then I guess, how are you guys thinking about M&A right now? Are there areas where you think you need or would like to have a particular technology or solution, and you're out there looking for the right one or is it more just a matter of evaluating things as they come to you?","Jay T. Flatley","In the last couple of years we're been quite active in the M&A front, and we have an organization that focuses expressly in this area, in fact, at any given time, we're looking at 5 to 10 potential opportunities, very few of which actually ever wind up getting executed. But in an average year, at our size now, we would probably do 2 to 5 transactions, most of them on the small side. There are a couple of key areas where we're seeking technologies that would enhance our overall end-to-end solution in areas like sample prep in particular where we have been quite public about our interest at the right time doing a diagnostic transaction that could help accelerate our penetration into the market, either with products or distribution reimbursement or all of the above.","Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just one quick one for Marc. Marc, do you see the buyback being paced over 12 months or so, or could you maybe get more aggressive in the near term there?","Marc Stapley","Yes. We're not giving any guidance at this point on when we're going to do the buybacks. We're going to take a look at how we do it and when we do it and we'll roll some of it in over time but the discretionary element, we'll be opportunistic about when we do that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Jay or Marc, can you give me a sense of how much of the strength in the quarter compared to plan would you do in approved run rate of the business as opposed to perhaps pulling some revenue forward from future quarters?","Jay T. Flatley","I don't think we really pulled much revenue forward at all. We had a book-to-bill ratio. As I mentioned, it was approximately 1.1. We continued to ship in the first week of the second quarter. We continued to ship significant products out the door. So I don't think there was any intentional effort to try to pull things forward from Q2 into Q1.","Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. But Jay, on that book-to-bill ratio, is there any way you could talk about a normalized number there? The reason I could use a little help is I'm uncertain how much of the booking strength was due to maybe pricing mechanics and people placing standing orders for a full year and consumables and that gets booked into bookings in the first quarter and makes that number look higher than it might otherwise look.","Jay T. Flatley","Well, you're right. I mean there's probably a little bit of that in that number, but the other thing to think about is that our book-to-bill has been over 1 for 3 consecutive quarters, and so this isn't just a one-quarter event. We've been building backlog now for 3 quarters in a row, and I think that speaks to the underlying run rate of the business. And if you look at sequencing revenue dollars, it's a run rate phenomenon. It's not a bookings or a full forward phenomenon.","Christian O. Henry","And if you look at the MiSeq demand, the MiSeq demand on a quarterly basis has been growing nicely in each of the 3 quarters of our ramp. So you see that as kind of a foundation that we're building both on the instrument side and on the consumable poolside.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Just 2 questions for me, if I can. The first is I've been looking at the strength, it's impressive in the consumables side, obviously on sequencing. But I guess what's a little surprising to me and some people as they're kind of asking some questions is why the gross margins would be down sequentially when you're consumables were up $30 million or so. Can you maybe just talk about that?","Jay T. Flatley","Marc, do you want to answer that one?","Marc Stapley","Yes. I mean, sequentially, if you recall what we said on our call last quarter was that we had a onetime catch-up adjustment due to the reliability of HiSeq, and that's one of the key drivers of the sequential change quarter-over-quarter. When you look at the year-over-year, you see the strength of the sequencing consumable mix driving the growth year-over-year.","Jay T. Flatley","The other thing that probably affected it a bit was we shipped a considerable number of MiSeqs out in the quarter and that's still a product that's very young in the manufacturing cycle, so we don't have the margins -- the gross margins in that product up to where they're ultimately going to be or where our typical instruments will be after, say, 18 months of shipments.","Christian O. Henry","Yes, that's true.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then, sorry, maybe just following up then on the MiSeq. I think you made a comment that you thought you took the market share lead in the desktop sequencers. And I just wondered if you could maybe clarify what you meant by that statement. And then kind of in conjunction with that, you said during the -- Christian was saying the third quarter here, you're still seeing some good growth in MiSeq orders and deliveries. And maybe just, do you think this is -- is this going to be growing sequentially through -- should we think of this as a sequential growth through 4, 5, 6, 7 quarters or sometimes you kind of hit a peak and then it slows down, maybe just how you're thinking about the MiSeq orders.","Jay T. Flatley","I think if you look at the revenue shipments and obviously, we don't know what our comparison is, so that's why we said we believe. But I think our revenue number on MiSeq was of a magnitude that we believe on a revenue basis instrument plus consumables that we'll have #1 market share for Q1. I think if you look forward, we won't necessarily, over the next quarter or 2, grow revenue sequentially. We think we'll grow orders sequentially and part of that is because we're on a catch-up mode in Q1 and we'll come back to Q4 to catch up from the initial bolus of the instrument orders. That will be partially offset by the ramp on the reagents and so it will depend on how fast the reagents come up to speed, and we'll be watching that very closely.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay. Just to clarify, you've had kind of a traditional pace in instruments and I'm just curious as you have experienced in kind of when you're out with customers with MiSeq, and I know it should have a -- its application, I guess, should be a bit broader than maybe some of your more academic products as you alluded to. So is this the type of product that you expect to have a -- longer legs in terms of that respect? Or do you think you will plateau at some point in terms of the instruments that you're shipping each quarter?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, I mean, every product plateaus at some point, the question is when. I think this type of product is helped to some extent by the fact that it will be pulled into clinical applications that don't switch out very quickly. So even if we came out with whatever the next version of MiSeq was 2 to 3 years from now, a derivative of MiSeq, let's say, that many of the clinical customers would continue to use the older instrument and continue to buy versions of the older instrument because they're embedded in their process and they've been through some FDA approval. So I do think, in that respect, this product will probably have a longer tail than non-FDA approved products would.","Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's very helpful. And if I could just one more, Jay. The cost associated with the Roche takeover, I think I remember from your filings, is it 6 quarters that those go on for that you have to pay Goldman Sachs and Bank of America?","Jay T. Flatley","I think that's right, yes.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","With respect to guidance, the revenue performance in Q1 outdid what you had expected when you gave Q1 guidance and yet you reaffirmed the full year number. I listened to the call, Jay, it sounds like that you're still pretty upbeat about the end markets. Are you just being conservative just for conservative sake, or is there something else that we need to be thinking about?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, 2 comments there, Quintin. One is that the range of guidance on the revenue side is pretty large, and so there's a big difference between the 11 and the 1175. And we are being -- when you use the word conservative, I'd use the word cautious about what's going to happen in the back half. I think, as we indicated in the script and the commentary, we have lots of reasons to believe it's going to be a lot better than it was last year. But we're trying to be careful about that and it's a time when we don't want to miss our numbers. And so for that reason, we're going into the rest of the year with that cautionary tone and we'll take a hard look again after Q2. And we'll have, I think, some considerable increased visibility as to what's going to happen in Q3 and Q4.","Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Then with respect to the issue that you had with the hostile takeover, I imagine that you and the board had a lot of introspection about the company and its potential. Jay, have there been any changes or maybe thoughts of accelerating some of your strategies in order to kind of demonstrate that Illumina's worth is more than the $51 a share offer that came from Roche?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, Quintin, we're pretty aggressive in general, and so accelerating what we're doing is not an easy thing to do. We can't just all of a sudden decide to go faster and make that happen. I think one thing that obviously we had talked about and considered is do we disclose more about where we're headed over time and give shareholders more confidence in what the roadmap looks like. And it turned out, for reasons I think that are clear now, that we didn't need to do that. And so I think that any time we disclose more directionally than makes prudent commercial sense that we create risks on our business that under normal circumstances we wouldn't want to create. And that's why we think an R&D day now is likely to be in the fall as opposed to any time sooner.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with Cantor Fitzgerald.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Jay, you talked about MiSeq, that you guys expecting MiSeq SD clearance in the second half. Could you talk about maybe what kind of conversation you're having with the FDA, what kind of feedback you might be getting? And will there be applications or assays associated with that? And also would you be getting approval for new upgrade to the MiSeq platform?","Jay T. Flatley","Just to be clear, initially, what we're planning to do is to submit it by year end, so won't be approved by year end. And yes, we will have an assay method on it and we may have more than one. One of the projects that we're working on quite aggressively is the partnership project with Siemens with an HIV assay, and we've already submitted a pre-IDE to the FDA on that product and we're working to move that forward as quickly as we can and get that submitted before the end of the year. And we're also working on some internal assays that we'll put on the machine as well. With respect to follow-on versions, if we make an upgrade to the MiSeq as we're planning to, to increase the output, anybody who uses a prior generation of MiSeq would go -- would have to go back to the FDA and prove substantial equivalence of the new box to the old box. And that does create a slower rate of change in the clinical market, and we would -- we're anticipating that some customers may want to embrace the newer technologies. But if they do, they have to go back through the substantial equivalent validation, which is significantly less by the way than an initial validation would be.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then for your sequencing customers interested in buying additional HiSeq platform or purchasing it for the first time, do you have a sense of what the split might be of 2000 versus 2500. Given the $100,000 price differential I think that you guys talked about seems pretty modest, so I'm just kind of curious as to how you guys are modeling that.","Jay T. Flatley","Yes, we think most of the new orders are going to come in for 2500. It's got great new capabilities. The genome in a day capability and the velocity of running exomes and RNA-Seq through it I think create new dimensions of applicability of the system, and we therefore think that at least 60% if not more of the new incoming orders will be for the 2500.","Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","Okay. And quickly, finally, what was the split between core labs and Genome Centers versus clinical lab customers for your sequencing platforms this quarter?","Jay T. Flatley","Well, we don't have the exact numbers for clinical that we're going to report to date, but as we've seen over the past probably 2 years now, over 90% of our placements were outside of Genome Centers.","Operator",".","And this concludes the question-and-answer portion for today's call, and I would now like to hand the call back over to management for closing remarks.","Kevin Williams","Thank you.

We are very disappointed with this and I would like to take the next few minutes to walk you through the components of the shortfall and the actions we're taking as a result.","Consistent with our pre-announcement, second quarter revenue of $838 million was impacted by three factors: the timing of population genomics initiatives; lower than expected DTC revenue; and lower than expected revenue associated with our non-high throughput portfolio.","Now that we've had time to analyze the quarter, I would like to share our insights into each of these factors. But before I do, I want to be clear that none of the contributors to our miss in Q2 challenge our conviction about the market, the broad and unbounded genomics opportunity or the competitive position of our technology.","Addressing each contributor in turn. First, as we support a growing number of population genomics programs. It is becoming clear that the ramp in the early phases can vary dramatically from expectations.","In 2019, due to a number of logistical factors, we saw several programs ramp more slowly than projected, delaying revenue in the second quarter and throughout 2019. To reflect more variable timelines, we are now allowing for slower ramp up trajectories in our forecasting.","Next, the ongoing weakness in the DTC market has resulted in a significant shortfall in our array business. We have previously based our DTC expectations on customer forecasts, but given unanticipated market softness, we are taking an even more cautious view of the opportunity in the near term. With limited visibility and when the market will return to growth, we have lowered our full-year expectation substantially to reflect the near-term uncertainties.","And lastly, in our analysis over the last four weeks, we have found no consistent contributors to the non-high throughput sequencing and consumables miss. No single theme emerged. Rather, we determined that the miss was linked to a number of customer, program or product-specific factors that routinely impact every quarter, sometimes positively and sometimes negatively.","In the case of the second quarter, the net effect of these shifts was negative, but we do not believe indicative of any fundamental changes in the business. Given the revenue shortfall, we're looking carefully at operating expenses to ensure we are spending appropriately through the rest of 2019, but rest assured, we will always prioritize innovation.","In summary, with the exception of the transition in DTC, we do not see any structural or fundamental change in the genomics opportunity. We continue to believe that we are in the early stages of a thesis that will play out over the next decade or more. We're confident that Illumina is well positioned to keep playing an important role in improving human health by helping our customers unlock the power of the genome.","Sam will get into the details of our financial results, but I'm going to start by focusing on growth drivers. This was a strong quarter for oncology testing, driving growth in both sequencing consumables and systems. While these are still early days, it is increasingly clear that genomic information will transform the standard of care for oncology patients.","In the U.S., more than 200 million lives are covered by insurers for targeted or comprehensive genomic testing, and yet of the 18 million cancer patients that were diagnosed in 2018, only a low single-digit percentage of patients who have their tumor sequenced, highlighting the substantial opportunity ahead of us.","Researchers and scientists around the world recognized the need for more-personalized therapies, evidenced by the growing number of targeted and immuno-oncology or IO therapies. In 2018, we saw a 67% increase in the number of experimental therapies in the global IO pipeline, and it's estimated that there are over 1,600 clinical trials currently registered for immuno therapies. In fact, in 2018, 12 new drugs were launched with a predictive biomarker, nine of which were approved for oncology indications and four launched with companion diagnostics.","Regulatory bodies are also working closely with the industry to help accelerate the introduction of novel drugs and diagnostics to the market. In the last two years, the FDA has granted Breakthrough Device Designation for eight genomic assays, including our companion diagnostic assay based on TSO 500 content.","Data continues to emerge on applications for early detection, therapy selection and recurrence monitoring, highlighting the opportunity ahead. With the continued emergence of new genomic biomarkers, it is clear that comprehensive genomic profiling or CGP will offer the best insights to improve patient outcomes.","Earlier this year, we launched TSO 500 RUO, our 523 gene assay that includes detection of emerging bio markers such as TMB and MSI. With TSO 500, customers can detect both DNA and RNA variance, which is key for Comprehensive Detection of both known and novel fusions. For example, NTRK Fusions cause cancer across many tumor types and can have multiple fusion partners.","So TSO 500's ability to detect novel fusion partners with its hybrid capture enrichment method is crucial to identifying actionable mutations. We have received positive feedback on the robustness of the panel and several customers have become - have begun validating our offering TSO 500, including global CROs.","We are pleased to share that TSO 500 performance and demand has exceeded our expectations. We continue to partner with three pharma companies to develop a companion diagnostic or CDx for indications associated with NTRK, RET and TMB. Over time, we believe more partners will leverage TSO 500 to identify actionable mutations for additional CDx indications.","Recently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network updated their prostate cancer guideline with new recommendations, stating NGS is the preferred method when testing patients' MSI status for Lynch syndrome or eligibility for pembrolizumab in castration-resistant prostate cancer.","Additionally, the guideline was updated to include NGS as an option when germline testing is recommended. This is a notable development and evidence that NGS-based testing is improving the standard of care. We're excited that our TSO 500 assay could enable testing for both germline and MSI requirements with a single tissue sample.","In the second quarter, more than 10 NovaSeq systems in the U.S. were associated with CGP, our liquid biopsy customers. Most of these went to customers scaling their NovaSeq operations, but four systems went to first-time NovaSeq customers, highlighting that oncology testing is starting to move firmly into the realm of high throughput.","Genetic testing is also showing momentum, five children's hospitals in the U.S. added NovaSeq this quarter to perform pediatric genomic testing. It's estimated that up to 14% of all pediatric hospital admissions are driven by a genetic condition, because genomic testing is the only way to diagnose some conditions. This equips physicians with the ability to save children and their parents a painful and expensive multi-year diagnostic odyssey.","Leveraging the success of Rady Children's Hospitals in genetic disease testing, other hospitals are looking to implement genomics in the pediatric setting. Notably, Florida is funding clinical whole-genome sequencing for critically-ill children at the Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami.","In the U.S., more than 150 million lives are covered for whole exome sequencing for patients suspected of a genetic disease. And yet, we believe less than 1% of eligible patients have had their exome or genome sequenced.","Just recently Blue Shield of California updated their medical policy to cover rapid whole-genome sequencing for children with undiagnosed disease. This is a huge milestone making Blue Shield of California the first major Blue Cross Blue Shield plan to cover whole-genome sequencing following the positive health technology assessment review from Evidence Street earlier this year.","Moving to reproductive health. We continue to see NIPT expand its reach in both high risk and average risk pregnancies. We see the largest opportunities in the U.S. and in China, where we currently estimate a combined penetration of only 30%. This means that around 70% or just under 15 million births a year could benefit from access to NIPT.","In the EU, less than 15% of pregnancies are covered, and we're seeing steady progress on improving coverage. In connection with continued momentum and reimbursement tailwinds, NIPT had a record revenue quarter with growing awareness and adoption.","In Europe, customers of our CE-IVD, VeriSeq NIPT products processed nearly twice as many samples in the second quarter compared to the same quarter last year, driven by the positive reimbursement environment and growing awareness of NIPT benefits. We are very excited to see this level of demand for NIPT and believe continued innovation will drive further growth in adoption.","Just last month, we launched the expanded version of VeriSeq NIPT, which is a CE-IVD test that offers the most comprehensive view of the fetal genome compared to other CE-IVD NIPT products. VeriSeq version 2 adds carrier type resolution across the genome, significantly increasing the number of chromosomal abnormalities that can be detected. We're seeing strong interest and expect to upgrade the majority of our partner labs to VeriSeq v2 within a year.","Turning to population genomics, we have seen have seen no change to the level of commitment that governments and other stakeholders have shown towards these projects. In fact, the overall population genomics thesis has not changed. Large scale population initiatives offer the opportunity to personalized medicine and improve the overall standard of care to ensure the optimal clinical and economic outcomes for patients.","They allow pharma companies to develop more effective therapies and accelerate the time from discovery to market. And they offer the promise of deepening our understanding of the human genome for the benefit of all.","It's therefore no surprise that we continue to see a growing list of countries, health systems and pharma companies announcing commitments to large scale genomics initiatives. As expected, these are complex programs with many stakeholders, and therefore, it can take years to gain critical mass and ramp in volume.","In 2019, we have seen how these large initiatives can have moving timelines. Let me share some insight into the programs that have impacted the most in the near term, but continued to give us confidence that large scale genomics initiatives will be a long-term growth driver.","First, the large deal that we expected to close in the second quarter was one that involved a number of stakeholders. The delays associated with final alignment between all the parties before they can sign off, but it continues to move forward.","Second, we have decreased our full-year expectations linked to the All of Us program here in the U.S. due to some risk and the timing of the launch of the 25,000 whole-genome pilot.","To be clear, we believe there is no shortage of samples are funding, rather we understand the program is in the process of submitting investigational device exemptions to the FDA, and is working with the IRB to receive approval for the consent process for returning results to volunteers. Additionally, they are in the process of selecting providers for genetic counseling resources. While we remain confident that the program will scale, we now project a 2020 start.","Third, we have also decreased our full-year expectations for the NHS commissioning, which you will recall, is the clinical implementation of whole-genome sequencing that is expected to follow the 100,000 genome project in the U.K. Incorporating routine genomic testing into a nationalized health service is not a small undertaking and the NHS is in the midst of making the necessary adjustments and building an information system to support the transition.","Beyond these programs, we have seen similar delays in other smaller programs that are also now reflected in our guidance revision. Despite these timing adjustments, we want to reiterate that Illumina is excited to be able to support these efforts to evolve our understanding of human health and disease. While we've seen continued softness in consumer genomics over the past few quarters, we are optimistic about the long-term DTC opportunity.","We estimate that less than 10% of individuals in the U.S. and significantly fewer worldwide have ever purchased the DTC test. As such, we do not believe that the DTC market is saturated. In the coming years, we expect to see the level of adoption significantly increase in the U.S. and around the world for applications, including genealogy, wellness, pharmacogenomics, health and entertainment.","We view this as a transitory phase of growth which is allowing DTC companies to explore new product offerings that meet evolving consumer interests. Importantly, Illumina is committed to supporting our DTC customers, as we strongly believe genomic insights will empower individuals to become more involved in their daily lives.","Let me now turn to research. The human genome project was launched in 1988. With the help of international researchers, the first human genome was finally completed in 2003. Since then, institutions and researchers from around the world have continued to fund and propel sequencing projects to gain valuable insights into human health.","We made impressive progress in our ability to diagnose and treat cancer and even develop life-saving vaccines, but we're still in the early stage of developing treatment for most complex genetic disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and Autism. These research efforts are invaluable as they inspire scientists to drive their insights into commercialized products that can touch the lives of millions.","The immunology and computational discovery at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute resulted in the spin-out of Adaptive Biotechnologies, who successfully went public last month. Separately, after years of genomic research, Johns Hopkins University spun out CancerSEEK, a potentially groundbreaking liquid biopsy early detection test. And new scientific discoveries will continue to unlock future research efforts.","For example, scientists at Harvard University have discovered new microfluidics and novel software that can be used to accelerate single-cell ATAC-seq, which could have a meaningful impact on single-cell genomics. We're excited to see sequencing play such a significant role in these monumental research efforts.","According to the SDi Global Assessment report, sequencing technologies are expected to be the most dominant life sciences instruments for research as a percentage of dollar spend. This reinforces our excitement about the Pacific Biosciences acquisition.","Integrating workflows for our short technology with PacBio's highly accurate long read sequencing technology will help accelerate research discoveries that we believe will lead to new clinical insights. We continue to work closely with regulators and expect the deal to close before the end of the year.","To date, less than 1% of the variance detected in human genomes have a function clearly ascribe to them. Researchers around the world are working to understand the function of the remaining variance in the human genome, not to mention, all of the other biology that's around this. To that end, innovation and quality remain our priorities as we work to deliver industry-leading tools that support researchers globally as they endeavor to understand the genetic basis of life.","Before I hand over to Sam, I want to provide some of the key trends from the second quarter that give us confidence about the overall health and trajectory of the business. Excluding the large deal that didn't close as expected, second quarter NovaSeq shipments were ahead of expectations.","We continue to expect NovaSeq shipments in 2019 to be flat to slightly up from 2018. Pull through per NovaSeq was once again above $1 million per system per year and was up sequentially. Even with our lower full-year revenue expectations, we continue to expect NovaSeq pull through per system to grow compared to 2018, and to be over $1 million per system.","S4 shipments exceeded $100 million for the first time this quarter and more than doubled from the same quarter a year ago. As expected, HiSeq consumables continued to decline, but combined high throughput consumables grew both sequentially and year-over-year.","We are pleased with the response to the introduction of S Prime and to the new lower pricing for the S1 and S2 flow cells. Growth in both S1 and S2 revenue more than offset the impact of the price decreases affected in the first quarter, while S Prime Flow Cell shipments, more than doubled in the second quarter of launch.","Off note, lower throughput NovaSeq flow cell introductions and pricing adjustments are part of our strategy to catalyze the next wave of NovaSeq conversions. And in the second quarter, nearly 30% of our NovaSeq purchases were from existing HiSeq customers. NovaSeq system ASPs were lower due to several multi-unit purchases in addition to customers taking advantage of our HiSeq trade-in program. Additionally, new to Illumina or straight from desktop customers represented over half of all NovaSeq orders in the second quarter,\\ the highest proportion since launch.","We also continue to see growth in NextSeq placements with system shipments growing sequentially and year-over-year. We're pleased to report that we placed a record number of NextSeq Dx Systems in the quarter and mid-throughput sequencing consumables associated with our NextSeq system were within our targeted range of $130,000 to $160,000.","For the low throughput portfolio, MiniSeq pull through was within targeted range of $20,000 to $25,000, and reflecting the benchtop weakness discussed in the pre-announce, MiSeq pull through was slightly below our $40,000 to $45,000 range. We were encouraged to see that system shipments for the entire low throughput portfolio grew both sequentially and year-over-year.","With that, I'll hand over to Sam, to review our second quarter financial results in detail. Sam?","Sam Samad","Thanks Francis.","As discussed, second quarter revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $838 million. This was driven by 6% growth in sequencing and offset by a 21% decline in microarrays revenue. Our Americas region delivered revenue of $476 million, up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong clinical performance, notably in oncology and genetic disease.","Excluding lower than expected revenues associated with our direct-to-consumer array business, the region's performance was largely in line with our expectations. EMEA revenue of $208 million, grew 3% year-over-year or 7% on a constant currency basis. Strong growth in sequencing consumables driven by cancer and genetic disease research, offset lower than expected sequencing revenue, primarily associated with population genomics and benchtop.","Emerging markets continue to contribute to growth, with approximately half the region's NovaSeq placements shipping to these countries in the second quarter. Greater China was down 9% to $97 million, but allowing for the $13 million tariff stocking orders that we shipped in the second quarter of 2018.","Revenues were up 3%, with growth in reproductive health and oncology testing consumables. APJ grew 4% to $57 million, with growth in genetic disease and infectious disease testing, partially offset by what we believe is temporarily moderated growth in oncology and reproductive health as new products are rolled out.","Moving to sequencing, consumable revenue grew 8% from the same quarter a year ago to $497 million or 11%, allowing for the $13 million stocking order that shipped in Q2 of 2018. We did not receive any stocking orders in China in Q2. Array consumables were down 13% from the same quarter a year ago, primarily driven by DTC. Array service and other revenue of $32 million was down 37% from the same quarter a year ago, reflecting lower DTC revenue.","Sequencing service and other revenue of $102 million was down 4% year-over-year, with the decline driven by lower GeL sequencing volumes compared to a year ago. Combined, total consumables, service and other revenue represented 84% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2019. This compares to 83% for the full year 2018.","Moving to systems, sequencing system revenue of $129 million, grew 4% from the second quarter of 2018, while arrays system revenue was flat. Combined, instrument revenue represented 16% of total revenue in the quarter.","Before I continue, I will highlight non-GAAP results that includes stock-based compensation. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's release and the supplementary data available on our website. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina's shareholders.","Additionally, and as a reminder, Illumina fully deconsolidated Helix from its financial reports in the second quarter. Our results today, therefore include expenses associated with Helix for the month of April only.","Non-GAAP gross margin of 69.5% was down 70 basis points sequentially as expected, driven by non-recurring revenue in sequencing service and other in Q1. Year-over-year, second quarter non-GAAP gross margin decreased approximately 80 basis points, primarily due to the lower volumes in our service business, partially offset by favorable product mix.","Non-GAAP operating expenses of $360 million were down $3 million from last quarter and were lower than expected, primarily due to lower variable compensation estimates that now reflect our revised revenue forecast for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin was therefore 26.6%, down from 27.2% last quarter.","Excluding Helix, which was included in our April results, operating margin was 27.3% compared to 29.1% last quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate of 17.3% was up from last quarter as expected due to the discrete tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions we saw in Q1.","For the second quarter of 2019, GAAP net income was $296 million or $1.99 per diluted share and non-GAAP net income was $200 million or $1.35 per diluted share, with the primary difference being unrealized gains from equity investments. Cash flow from operations was $143 million. DSO of 51 days, increased from 49 days last quarter.","In terms of other items impacting cash, capital expenditures were $47 million in Q2. Our 2019 convertible notes matured on June 15. As a result, we repaid the outstanding $632 million principal in cash, $84 million of which was classified as cash flow from operations. In addition, we issued approximately 400,000 shares for the premium.","And finally, we did not repurchase any stock in the second quarter, leaving approximately $488 million available for share repurchases under the current plan as of June 30. We therefore ended the second quarter with approximately $3.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.","Moving to guidance, and as you saw in our pre-announcement, we are now expecting 2019 revenue growth of approximately 6%. Compared to our prior revenue guidance, the reduction is primarily associated with lower near-term expectations in DTC, reflecting our experience in the first half of 2019 and allowing additional caution in our array consumable and service revenues, a more cautious assumption regarding the ramp of certain population genomics initiatives.","Lower non-high throughput systems and consumables, including a delay in a partner program and a generally more cautious view to allow more time for platform of program scale ups and transitions, especially for our large customers.","Moving to the rest of the P&L, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be down approximately 100 basis points compared to the 70.1% reported for the full-year 2018, primarily due to lower margins associated with lower service volumes, lower ASPs as expected, partially offset by favorable product mix.","We expect full-year non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to improve by approximately 125 basis points compared to 2018. This is related to the OpEx reprioritization activities we've undertaken since the end of the second quarter, which are focused on continued investments for our strategic priorities and identified opportunities for greater leverage across G&A, including lower headcount additions and associated expenses.","We expect non-GAAP other income to be lower in the second half versus the first half due to the lower cash balance following repayment of our 2019 notes. We anticipate that the non-GAAP tax rate will generally be in line with 2018. As a result, non-GAAP full-year earnings per share is expected to be between $6 and $6.10.","GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $6.41 and $6.51. As a reminder, with Helix fully deconsolidated, we don't expect any non-controlling interest going forward. So you should model zero dollars for NCI starting in the third quarter of this year.","And finally, we expect weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be roughly flat year-over-year at approximately 149 million. Although our 2021 notes are currently not convertible, the dilutive shares remain in our Q2 and full-year diluted share count, because our share price has exceeded the conversion price. As such, approximately 1 million shares are included in both Q2 and full-year diluted share count for both the 2019 and 2021 notes.","Moving to third quarter guidance, we expect revenue to grow approximately 2% compared to Q3 of 2018. Non-GAAP gross margin to be slightly down compared to the second quarter of 2019 due to mix. Non-GAAP OpEx as a percent of revenue to improve approximately 100 basis points on a sequential basis as we continue to implement the lower operating expense plan for the rest of the year.","Non-GAAP other income to be down sequentially, reflecting the lower cash balance. Non-GAAP tax rate to be slightly higher compared to last quarter. And again, there will be no contribution associated with non-controlling interests.","With that, we'll open up the call to Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken","So maybe a two-parter on just the sort of PopSeq outcome. I guess maybe first for Francis, as you think about sort of some of the color you gave us on the push-out of a number of projects, but then counter that again sort of the general excitement, I'm sure you see from the customer base, I guess how are you feeling about sort of the forward cadence of how a number of these are going to roll out and I guess how you evolved your thinking around maybe less so the size of the opportunity, but the timeframe maybe of which it will play out, just sort of at a broad brush? And then Sam on the guidance side, I guess how are you thinking about treating these kind of harder to predict maybe large-scale projects on a go-forward basis just given the fact, you didn't obviously have a ton of experience with them before and now obviously, you're seeing some of the pieces that could maybe move things around, I guess, how does that sort of change the approach there given obviously you guys are always playing the long game?","Francis deSouza","I'll start with be the commentary and color on the PopSeq opportunities. And I'd say that we learned a few things in going through the last quarter, we learned about the ramp of the PopSeq opportunities and I'll talk about that and we also learned about the evolving makeup of the PopSeq opportunities and the different drivers.","And overall, I'd say, look we are pioneering a whole new area here with our customers, right. This whole area of population genomics is brand new. Over the last few years, it was really just Genomics England that we were working with that, that was the whole sort of PopSeq opportunity and now we are working with dozens of countries around launching these population initiatives in all of those countries.","So it's a brand new area and there's just not a lot of pattern matching to do in terms of how these things will ramp up. So, we are collectively learning as an ecosystem about how these systems will roll out.","And in terms of the ramp what we are learning is all the different things that need to happen to get these things to scale, and in some senses, there is a lot of things that have to happen that are across the countries, so it's about setting up access to the samples, it's about getting the informatics pipeline in place, it's about sort of integrating with the National Health Systems.","And in some cases, there are just things that we're learning that are unique about the different opportunities and we're learning together as we go through our customers - go through with our customers.","And so based on those learnings with the NHS in the U.K. and GeL with all of us and a number of other initiatives, that's what's caused us to revise our guidance and take a more cautious view in terms of how these deals are going to ramp.","In the U.S., for example, working with all of us, but there are really three things that they're moving the ball forward on. One is on their IDE submission with the FDA. The second one is getting their IRB approval around consent and return of samples. And the third is selecting the genetic counseling services that they're going to be working. They are making progress on all of them, but they are all complex and so from our projections, we've moved out the ramp into 2020.","The other thing that we've learned there beyond the ramp is the makeup of these population genomics initiatives and we continue to see growth in terms of the number of countries that are interested and have announced initiatives.","So, in the last quarter, for example, we've heard from countries like Korea talking about their plan to sequence 1 million genomes by 2029, India has announced plans for genome India project that it plans to launch and then we've also learned about the interest in pharma companies in getting involved in these population genomics initiatives.","You've seen the announcement from deCODE partnering with Intermountain to sequence 500,000 individuals. There was a partnership between Mayo and Regeneron, between Nebula Genomics and EMD Serono.","And so we're seeing a whole other ecosystem show up in this population genomics world, where as pharma collaborating with these population genomics initiatives. So, it's hugely exciting because it increases the utility of these programs, but it also adds complexity in terms of the ramp up of the process and that's what we are learning.","Sam Samad","Yes, and Ross maybe to talk about guidance and your question is a good one. So, I would approach this, I would answer this in kind of two parts. One is obviously what we had in the first half was the best information that we had available at the time with regards to these initiatives. And now, this information has changed, its changed with regards to all of us, it has changed with regards to a couple of other population genomics initiatives and also we had one that was delayed from Q2 to the second half as we talked about that impacted the quarter.","But I would say in addition to that in general, we are taking a much more cautious approach related to these population genomics initiatives because of a lot of the things that Francis is just mentioned, because of the fact that the lead times around these are much longer than other deals and because of the fact that I think it's just prudent to be cautious, as we look at these deals going forward. So that's the - I would say the change in the approach that we're taking.","And in terms of guidance, our guidance reflects really a much lower outlook for these population genomics initiatives in 2019 in the second half. And we're applying that logic for other parts of our business as well, which is reflected in the guidance where we are applying the same logic for other transitions, other large customers other scale ups and we referred to that on the prepared comments.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho Peterson","Maybe, following up on that understanding that PopSeq and DTC, these shortfalls are kind of beyond your control and I appreciate your comments there. It would be helpful to know what's actually embedded in guidance for the back half of the year for PopSeq, but more importantly, I think most people are focused on what is the recovery for next year might look like, and I know you don't want to talk quantitatively about 2020.","But as we think about some of the things you've talked to, China was down, I understand that was a tough comp, I'm curious what you think about a recovery there and then on benchtop, what is your confident in TMB as a market given some of the data we've seen from Bristol and average risk in NIPT seems to be another driver.","So I'm wondering if you could talk to those three things in particular, and then just clarify what exactly is in guidance for PopSeq for the remainder of this year? Thanks.","Sam Samad","So let me start, Tycho and Francis could add some comments as well with regards to the direction of the business, but with regards to the PopGen for the second half, other than the one deal that we talked about that moved from the first half into the second half, we've really derisked our assumptions behind population genomics in the second half and that was a big contributor to the guidance revision.","So - and that's across all of our - notable ones that I would refer to our All of Us and the NHS commissioning project, where we've really taken out a lot of the sequential growth that we had in the second half.","And then with DTC, we've taken the same approach as well and that's reflected in guidance, and I think you could see it in that 14% decline year-over-year in microarrays in our revised guidance, which basically indicates that we've taken a much more cautious approach with regards to DTC as well, where we're taking customer forecast, but we're also applying an additional measure of caution on those.","And as I mentioned earlier, we've applied that same also consistent logic across some of the other large customers that we have, where we have either new products, new applications, in some cases new panels and in some cases new markets like liquid biopsy where we have customers entering.","So we've taken a more cautious approach on those. But in terms of looking forward and beyond for 2020 and beyond that, obviously, we won't be talking about 2020 today, but I can tell you population genomics strategically ended transition of some of these programs into standard of care and to clinical care is still dramatically a very important strategic driver for us. But at this point, it's still not a significant contributor to our business and we've taken a lot of the driver of that out from our 2019 guidance.","Francis deSouza","So if I look forward then, Tycho and start to think about 2020 and beyond, there are few things I'd say, one, while we have moved the projection of All of Us out of 2019, we certainly expect it to be a contributor in 2020 and what All of Us has said, as you know, is that they wanted to sequence 25,000 genomes in their first year of operation. And so you can expect that some of that shows up obviously in 2020.","Similarly, we expect the NHS to start ramping up into next year and that will be a contributor next year. In addition, we have a lot of these other population sequencing initiatives, whether it's France or I talked about Singapore or India and then some of the longer-term seeds that are being sown.","We also expect to see contributions from initiatives like Australia, would they have announced their AUD500 million genomics investment focusing on rare disease and cancer, touched on Singapore, we expect it to continue to see development in the million veterans program here. And so we see population sequencing continuing to build and we certainly expect it to be a bigger contributor in 2020 and going forward than it has been historically.","If we look at China, there are a number of things that we think will serve as growth drivers into the future. We'll start with NIPT, if we look at where we are today, we estimate today there are 3 million to 4 million NIPT tests done annually in China. And the opportunity there is much bigger, because there are 15 million births a year, and so we're expecting to continue to see increased penetration into that NIPT market and we're doing a number of things to continue to drive that for the longer term.","So we signed a partnership, for example, with the Medical Information Institute of the China Academy of Medical Science for an NIPT health and economics study, and the idea there is to build evidence on the benefits of NIPT for first-line use, so that we can continue to expand the penetration of NIPT in China.","In addition, we expect oncology to continue to be a driver in the Chinese market and to that end, we've announced a number of partnerships, including one with AnchorDX for IVD partners - partnership development for oncology assays on the MiSeq Dx. And so that builds on the stable of partners that we're building in China that includes Annoroad and Amoy across the reproductive health and oncology space. Longer term in China, we're also excited about the emergence of a consumer genomics segment in China.","So, if you look at companies like regime, they're estimating that they will do tens of thousands of consumer genomics test starting next year and building, and so we think long-term that could be a growth driver in China as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel","I want to talk about underlying growth and then I would like to just try to get a clarification on NextSeq. So starting on underlying growth, just to run through some math, based on your prior disclosures on microarray products and microarray services, it seems like consumer genetics revenue approximated about 10% of total sales coming into this year. If we were to assume that declined pretty robust number like 50% to 60% this quarter, and normalized for that, it would suggest your underlying adjusted growth was only about 6% to 8% in the quarter, even adjusted for the bulk order in the base, you would only get to 8% to 10%, and if I apply the same logic for the full year, I get to a similar number. So given your TAM, your market position and your valuation, it just seems hard to explain this, Francis. So I'm just wondering, as you think about the next few years is that enough?","And then on NextSeq, when you pre-announced Q2 results, you more tightly linked to non-high end NGS weakness to NextSeq coming up light of expectations and then speaking with you after the announcement, you made it clear that the NextSeq shortfall was a function of a companion diagnostic partnership delay and you indicated the impact would be even more meaningful in the second half. I don't think you called out any of this in your prepared remarks today. So I'm just wondering what changed in terms of the partner in assessing your conservatism and change in guidance philosophy, it would be helpful to know if this was Loxo or Bristol or if it was somebody else? Thank you.","Sam Samad","Yes Doug, this is Sam. Let me touch on the core growth. So yeah, you're right, I mean as you look at obviously what we talked about both in the pre-announcement and in some of our comments around core growth, sequencing growth is expected to be in the 10% range, and we're seeing sequencing consumable growth or our expectations for sequencing consumable growth to be in the teens.","Now having said this, this is definitely lower than what we had guided to at the beginning of the year. So it's definitely a step down from what we had talked about earlier, but part of that is driven by also the population genomics impact that we have.","So it's impacting both sequencing as a whole and sequencing consumables. I think if you look at this business, I mean, over the last number of years, there is definitely some cyclicality in some years, but over the course of a number of years, our growth has continued to be at least on the core business and in the mid-teens on sequencing consumables and also in terms of sequencing as a whole.","So without really commenting too much on 2020 right now and going forward, I think although definitely take your comments, we still are very, very positive in terms of the long-term growth of this business, and the things that really give us confidence or things that we saw also in Q2, what we saw is that NovaSeq pull through continues to improve and was higher than what it was in Q1.","So sequentially it grew. What we saw is that NovaSeq consumables actually grew, volumes grew about $40 million sequentially and $100 million versus the same quarter in the prior year. NovaSeq placements, if you exclude this one order that we had or the one deal that we had that slipped into the second half, actually NovaSeq placements in the first half are exactly on expectations and for the full year, we expect them to be flat to slightly increasing, which is what we guided to at the start of the year.","So across many aspects of our business and across the core aspects, we're still seeing the very encouraging signs that we talked about. But having said this, obviously, we have talked about a big miss and I take that - and we take that seriously, but we're still very encouraged about the core aspects of our business.","Francis deSouza","Yes. If I had just a little bit more color. So, as you know, Doug, this is a cyclical business and it wouldn't be right to take this year's growth rate as sort of indicative of a new normal as we look at next year and going forward, while there have been delays, for example, the ramp-up of some of these population sequencing initiatives, they will ramp up and some of them starting early next year. And the interesting thing about these population sequencing initiatives for a lot of them is that they're not projects, they are not sort of one-off research projects, but they become the standard of care in a National Health System.","So for example, the way it's being rolled out in the U.K. at the NHS is once this is rolled out, it does become a standard of care for the population going forward around genetic disease and oncology testing, and that's how a lot of countries are thinking about it. And so that's all accretive to our growth over time and that's really not a factor this year in terms of revenue for us.","And then also if we look at the placement of instruments, which over a multi-quarter period, once you adjust for the lumpiness of the business is an indicator of the future growth of our business. If you look at on the high throughput side, we're pleased with NovaSeq's performance, shipments are ahead both Q1 and first half expectations, orders are up both sequentially and year-over-year.","So the NovaSeq demand at the high throughput end of the portfolio is still very robust. And then if you look at NextSeq, we talked about the record placement of NovaSeq systems and the lower throughput portfolio shipments also grew both sequentially and year-over-year. And so those are good indicators, we believe our future growth.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Steve Beuchaw","So at risk of seeming uncreative, I do want to circle back to a couple of points that have already been raised in the Q&A and try to get a little bit more detail. The first is China. I wonder if you could give us some color as to why it is that the China segment of the business decelerated in the quarter and what it is your expectation is for growth in China in the back half of the year? And then the second thing I'd like to hear about is how you're thinking about revenue particularly associated with assays around TMB, it does seem like there's been a fair amount of evolution in the way that the biopharma sector is thinking about TMB during 2Q, so would really appreciate some clarity there? Thanks so much.","Sam Samad","Yes. Thanks, Steve. I'll start - Sam with China and thanks for the question. Obviously, the quarterly growth was lower than what we've seen over the past few quarters in terms of China, and we have had some choppiness in China over the past few quarters because - more so because of tariffs and some pre-buying ahead of tariffs, although we didn't have any of that this quarter.","But Francis alluded to some of the really positive things that we are going on in China and that we saw in the quarter in terms of the clinical part of the business, the growth around clinical in terms of oncology testing, in terms of NIPT, in terms of the work that we're doing with some of the partners and the panels that they are placing on our instruments, on our Dx instruments.","But having said this, we have and expect to see for the full year notable impact regarding some customer transition and the customer transition is around some customers, a couple of large customers that essentially are scaling operations outside of China and moving some volumes outside of China, although we also have seen a customer move volumes or plan to move volumes into China, but hasn't done so yet.","So when we refer to customer transition, this is really what we're referring to is, we're seeing some lag in terms of volumes between customers that we're doing work in China and now planning to scale out of China and also customers that are moving into China, but the volumes haven't move there yet. So there is a little bit of noise in that and that's dampening our growth for the year.","Francis deSouza","And then, if I take your oncology question, Steve. Look, TMB is an interesting area of research, but it's certainly not a big driver of our oncology business today. If I think about what's really driving our oncology business, a lot of it is driven by customers that are using our assays or our partner assays on our sequencers to identify the mutational profile of a tumor to - then connect a patient with the appropriate personalized therapy.","So, mutation profiling of the tumor and tumor normal sequencing is one of the big drivers, liquid biopsy is another big driver of our business, with customers using our sequencing to monitor for cancer recurrence to do the cancer profiling and then, obviously to do the big studies around potential for cancer screening. Those are some of the big use cases that are drivers of our oncology business today.","TMB is one of the additional biomarkers that some of our customers are looking at and there's lots of interest in trying to understand the predictive capability of TMB and if you look at our TSO 500 assay, it has measurement of TMB as one of the components of the assay, but it also does DNA and RNA profiling, it also does MSI and it looks for fusion's both known and novel fusions. So, a whole set of things in the TSO 500 assay, including as one of them for some of our customers, looking for TMB and then assessing its value as a predictive biomarker for the effectiveness of the therapy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Michael Ryskin","This is Michael Ryskin on for Derrick. Thanks for taking the question. I want to touch on the OpEx comments you mentioned something in the prepared remarks about lower head count additions - G&A, but can you provide some more details on what you're targeting? If there is any areas you're actually scaling down and also, how quickly will be able to scale back up, whether it's in 2020 or some further point down the relative support to the growth once the top line starts?","And then quick follow-up on PacBio. In the prepared remarks, again, you mentioned I think the 4Q close, but clearly there has been a lot of noise with the CMA etc. So, could we just talk about if it doesn't close, what would the plan B? Is it fair to think that will be more share buybacks or is there something else in the deal pipeline? Thanks.","Sam Samad","So, let me talk about OpEx and the approach that we've taken and some of the OpEx initiatives that we're going to be implementing now going into the second half, but obviously we take as seriously, both in terms of Q2 and in terms of the guidance revision for the year.","So, we've taken a very focused approach with regards to OpEx whereby, we're not going to impact innovation, I mean, making sure that we safeguard innovation is critical for us. So, we are really still focused on ensuring that we have the right level of spend in investment behind our strategic priorities.","But in terms of other areas where we can ensure that we are at least offsetting portion of this guidance revision on the top line with some OpEx initiatives, we're taking a very focused approach in terms of slowing down, hiring in certain cases, I would say, a pretty intense focus on G&A to make sure that we take - we focus on anything that's discretionary and apply a measure of restraint and phasing and timing and also in some cases, we have to make some trade-offs as well and we're going to have to delay certain things, but I think with regards to your question, we are very focused on making sure that we don't impact innovation, because that really help sustain our long-term growth.","Michael Ryskin","Thank you.","Sam Samad","And then PacBio, did you want to talk about the PacBio?","Francis deSouza","Yes, so where we are with PacBio to close on that question is, we are currently working in Phase II, as you know, with the CMA and the way that works is that they have appointed a panel that we are working with to provide the information they need to make the decision to answer questions that they have and the CMA has up to the middle of December to come back with a decision. They've not always taken that full time so they could come back with a decision before that, but that's the time they have.","Similarly, we're working in the U.S., here with the FTC. And we are providing them with the additional information they need to provide be the information to the commissioners that will then make a decision. We expect that decision to come in before the CMA time runs out. And so we would be looking for that decision in the next couple of months.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark Massaro with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","Mark Massaro","The first one is on DTC. Francis, I appreciate your comments about WeGene looking to ramp-up likely in 2020, but, obviously, there are some large U.S. customers that have sort of slowed down. So can you just speak to - and you also talked about how it may take or you expect a ramp in the coming years. Certainly the coming years is a wide range and so can you just give us a sense of your conviction of the U.S. DTC market ramping sometime in 2020?","My second question is on the $100 genome, based on the backdrop of slower sequencing consumables than expected, can you just give us a sense for what guideposts you're looking at to determine when customers will be ready for the $100 genome?","Sam Samad","Sure. So, let's start with the DTC. At this point, we are not ready to call when the DTC market will return to growth. The approach we've taken so far is that we take the estimates from our customers who are the DTC service providers and based on the learnings from the last quarter, what we're doing going forward is, we're taking a more cautious view of the numbers they give us.","So we're going to be working closely with them to continue to get their estimates of where the market is going to go and then we'll take a more cautious view on those numbers going forward. We do know that a number of seeds are being placed for future growth and it's the expansion here in the U.S. beyond primarily genealogy-driven market more into healthcare.","We know that both here in the U.S. and abroad, there is a drive for sequencing instead of array-based products to provide more information to customers, and we know that there are many DTC customers being set up outside the U.S. in countries like China, Korea and Japan. But at this stage we're not calling when those trends will sort of net to an overall growth for the DTC market yet.","In terms of the $100 genome, the approach we're taking is twofold. One is from an engineering perspective, we are doing all the work to make sure that when we provide the $100 genome, we can do so in a way that is friendly to our financials. So that we can do so in a way that's helpful from a margin perspective.","So we're doing all the engineering work to take costs out of the system and deliver the innovation that allows us to do that. But more importantly, we are spending time with customers, understanding the demand that will be generated from $100 genome, understanding from the retailers' perspective, population perspective, what are the cohorts that get enabled from a $100 genome and when we feel like the demand will kick off elasticity such a little more than compensate for the drop in price and we have the product ready. Those two things intersect is when we will bring it to the market.","Operator","And our last question comes from Dan Brennan with UBS. Your line is now open.","Dan Brennan","I had a question on oncology, I know you've spent some time throughout the Q&A on it, but I believe it's a little shy of 20% of revenue. So can you just give us some color, how did oncology do in the quarter in terms of the growth rate? What's kind of assumed in your 2019 guidance for oncology growth? And Francis, like, what factors should we be aware of what the regulatory coverage or timing of customer products that could accelerate growth in oncology? Thank you.","Francis deSouza","Sure. So let's start by saying that if you look at the things to watch for as we're going forward. One of the things we continue to track obviously is the penetration of NGS testing into both the leading cancer centers and hospitals, as well as the penetration of NGS testing into the community hospitals in the U.S. where the bulk over time of the tumor profiling will happen.","There have been some studies that have come out recently that have been interesting around the penetration of NGS testing and the increasing adoption of larger panels and whole-genome exome. From an external perspective, obviously, we continue to track what's happening in terms of guidelines and in terms of reimbursement. And we've seen significant progress happen even over the last year in terms of reimbursement for NGS testing and those are leading indicators that haven't yet played out we believe to their full extent.","In addition, the NCCN guidelines that I talked about that recommends NGS testing as preferred testing for MSI therapy selection, as well as NGS is an option for germline testing just came out in the last few weeks. And so, whether it's reimbursement, guidelines, a lot of those things are still in the very early stages of playing out, but our good forward indicators of what the size of that opportunity could be.","Sam Samad","And then, with regards to the actual numbers that I think you're looking for in terms of what was the growth in Q2, what's the growth for the year and you cited the number, I think that we gave for 2018. As we mentioned in our - on the Q1 call, we won't be updating those numbers in terms of the actual growth, in terms of oncology testing and clinical and research every quarter or giving forward-looking comments around that.","So, all I can tell you is we are still very pleased and we're very pleased with the growth that we're seeing in oncology testing and across clinical, but we will not be giving those specific breakdowns on a quarterly basis.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jacquie Ross for any closing remarks.","Jacquie Ross","Thank you.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Rebecca Chambers. Please go ahead.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks, Katie.

As we shared a few weeks ago, our third quarter revenue was $607 million, a 10% increase over Q3 of last year. And we expect Q4 revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. This is lower than the outlook we provided in July. Since the close of the quarter, we have analyzed market and funding dynamics, capacity utilization, competition and outsourcing trends. Based on these reviews, we do not believe that excess market capacity, outsourcing or competition materially affected our results or outlook.","Utilization of our high-throughput installed base continues to trend upward, normalizing for the large annual stocking orders received in Q3 both this year and last. Additionally, purchasing patterns at customers who have only HiSeq 2500s have been stable, supporting the view that these labs are not increasing their outsourcing to service providers. Lastly, from a competition standpoint, while we do compete for the allocation of funds, our win rates remain steady and we do not believe this has been a significant factor.","We have identified the factors we believe drove our Q3 miss and lower fourth quarter revenue guidance. First, in the second half, we have been tracking opportunities for more than 90 HiSeq X instruments between funnel and backlog, and previously forecasted that more than 60 would ship. Due to a shift in certain U.S. government institutions' funding practices and two customer-specific situations, approximately 35 of these instruments have moved out of the second half.","For the academic and government opportunities, projects of these institutions were previously awarded in three-year to five-year commitments, enabling customers to purchase instruments upon award. This year, smaller portions of these projects were awarded with shorter or uncertain time frames, affecting our customers' ability to make capital commitments. Ultimately, we do not believe that this change will affect the size of these programs, which plan to sequence more than 100,000 genomes in the coming years.","Based on these programs as well as other personalized medicine projects, including France's plans to establish population-scale sequencing operations and the Cancer Moonshot initiative, we believe that sequencing sample growth remains robust. Furthermore, as we shared in the preannouncement, one HiSeq X system that was expected to close in Q3 did not materialize due to capital constraints specific to that customer. Additionally, we removed a HiSeq X Ten associated with a nation-scale project that was originally anticipated in Q4 and has since pushed to 2017 due to lab readiness.","The other factor that contributed to the second half shortfall was lower-than-anticipated HiSeq 2500 and 4000 orders, which we believe was driven by legacy HiSeq customers favoring the HiSeq X and NextSeq platforms. The introduction of HiSeq X Ten \u2013 HiSeq X in January 2014 enabled whole-genome sequencing to be performed much more economically. And as a result, samples have shifted to whole-genome sequencing at the expense of other applications. Whole-genome sequencing on HiSeq X now represents approximately 15% of all high-throughput runs compared to 2% just two years ago.","Additionally, the release of NextSeq's v2 reagents in 2015 brought the quality on par with HiSeq. As a result, some high-throughput customers have been adopting NextSeq, given its flexible workflow, which enables batching fewer samples and attractive operating costs. As a result, we will not see the second half uptick in high-throughput instrument placements we had previously expected. To better identify trends like this earlier, we have initiated a global forecast improvement project, which I have asked Marc to lead, that will enhance both our visibility and forecast accuracy.","Over time, we are relatively indifferent to these shifts, as in both of these cases the lower operating costs of HiSeq X and NextSeq enables our customers to sequence more samples. However, the timing of the elasticity taking effect or the customer completing their transition varies across customers and can create a temporary dip in spending.","Given this, HiSeq consumer utilization was slightly below our guidance range of $300,000 to $350,000, driven primarily by a few customers shifting to other platforms in the Americas, including the HiSeq 4000, and not a decline in utilization across the broader installed base. These new platform implementations take time, sometimes several quarters, and are expected to impact utilization in Q4.","Moving now to the rest of our portfolio. Benchtop instruments performed well in the quarter. NextSeq benefited from commercial customers scaling capacity, including NIPT customers in the U.S. and China, and saw continued strength in consumable utilization with pull-through at the top end of the guidance range of $100,000 to $150,000. Additionally, both instrument and reagent sales of MiSeq and MiniSeq performed in line with our expectations.","Microarrays grew more than 35% year over year, driven by another quarter of strong direct-to-consumer demand as well as robust interest from agriculture customers, which increased 20%. Array orders grew more than 90% versus the third quarter of last year, as we received orders for another two million samples for our Global Screening Array, or GSA, during the quarter, bringing the total to over five million samples. Additionally, Infinium XT gained traction in Q3 and as this product continues to contribute to order growth. Both of these new products are now shipping and have backlogs that extend over the next few years, which has led to an improved multiyear outlook for arrays.","I will now move to an update on a few of our key markets. Oncology testing shipments grew 24% versus the prior year as our broad enablement strategy continues to drive the penetration of the oncology market. Importantly, the research use only launch of our TruSight Tumor 170 panel remains on our expected schedule for later this quarter. Additionally, we have submitted our companion diagnostic test for Vectibix, developed through our partnership with Amgen, to the FDA for premarket approval. In NIPT, we continue to see customers shifting to testing in-house in our sequencers. And as a result, we performed about 20,000 samples through our testing facility.","Over the last four quarters, we have transitioned two large customers and, going forward, expect more stable TSO volumes as well as continued growth in sequencing instruments and consumable sales. Our multiyear outlook for these markets remains optimistic, driven by oncology reimbursement and regulation playing out over time, and our ability to penetrate the average risk and global NIPT opportunities.","I would like to take a moment to discuss the announcement we filed today that Christian Henry will be leaving the company at the end of January. As many of you know, Christian has been an integral part of our team since joining Illumina as Chief Financial Officer in 2005. He has held many different leadership roles, including General Manager of the Genomic Solutions and Life Sciences business, as well as most recently, our Chief Commercial Officer.","I would like to thank Christian for his many contributions over the years and wish him and his family the best as they embark on their next chapter. Effective immediately, I have asked Mark Van Oene, currently the General Manager of our Americas business, to step in as Interim Chief Commercial Officer while we conduct a search. Mark has been a member of the Illumina team since 2006 and has successfully led our Americas commercial team to remarkable growth. I am confident that with Mark's help, supported by the strong commercial team that Christian has built, we are in good hands during this transition phase.","In closing, the current product life cycle dynamics may take several quarters to resolve but they are temporal in nature. We remain in the beginning stages of the large and untapped genomics market and remain committed to introducing innovative technology over the coming years.","I will now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our third-quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks, Francis. As Francis mentioned, total revenue grew 10% year-over-year to $607 million, consistent with our preliminary estimate on October 10. Sequencing consumables and strong demand for microarrays drove the growth, offset by a decline in sequencing instruments.","Geographically, revenue in the Americas grew 2% versus the prior year due to lower-than-expected HiSeq 2500 and 4000 instruments and HiSeq 2500 reagent shipments, as well as a challenging HiSeq X comparison. Asia-Pacific revenue increased 35% versus Q3 2015, as China grew more than 85%. European revenue grew 16%, a slight beat to forecast, and we believe that the region's positive progress on execution will continue over the coming quarters.","Sequencing instrument revenue declined 26% year-over-year to $106 million. While the year-over-year drop was predicted due to the challenging HiSeq X comparison, this result was lower than our projection, given the miss in high-throughput instruments, as Francis discussed.","Consumable revenue represented 65% of total revenue to equal $396 million, an increase of 23% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Sequencing consumable revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $333 million, driven by our growing installed base of instruments and particular strength in HiSeq X and NextSeq consumables. Please note that we have removed approximately 64 HiSeq instruments from our ending Q3 installed base to reflect the units taken offline due to the adoption of newer machines.","Services and other revenue grew approximately 18% versus Q3 2015 to $93 million, led by strength in genotyping services and sequencing instrument maintenance contracts associated with the larger installed base, partially offset by an expected decline in NIPT service revenue, given customer migrations to in-house testing.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which excludes non-cash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures as well as our GAAP EPS guidance, which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders.","Our adjusted gross margin for the third quarter was 72.5%, a sequential decrease of 30 basis points. Year over year, gross margin decreased 70 basis points, given investment in sequencing consumable and array manufacturing capacity, as well as our clinical capabilities, which was partially offset by favorable consumable mix.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $114 million or 18.8% of revenue, including $14 million or 2.4% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $114 million or 19% of revenue in the second quarter.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $117 million or 19.3% of revenue, including $9 million or 1.5% attributable to GRAIL and Helix. This compares to $127 million or 21.2% of revenue in Q2.","Given our updated revenue and earnings forecast for the year, we booked a $16 million benefit in Q3, primarily to operating expense, resulting from adjustments to our annual variable compensation plan accrual. Additionally, we removed $6 million of compensation expense from our Q4 forecast. Neither of these adjustments were anticipated in our previous forecast or guidance. For 2017 planning purposes, investors should contemplate an incremental $0.22 EPS headwind as the accrual returns to normal levels for the full year.","Adjusted operating margins were 34.4%, compared to 32.6% in the second quarter, higher primarily due to the variable compensation accrual benefit as well as lower legal expenses. Operating margin was lower compared to the 36% reported in the third quarter of last year due to increased investments in head count, GRAIL and Helix. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 38.2%. Stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, up sequentially from $32 million.","We reported third-quarter GAAP net income of $129 million and EPS of $0.87 per diluted share, compared to net income of $118 million or $0.79 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Our non-GAAP net income was $144 million, which led to $0.97 in earnings per diluted share, which includes an $0.08 benefit from the compensation adjustment mentioned previously. Non-GAAP EPS this quarter included approximately $0.05 and $0.02 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix, respectively. This quarterly result compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $120 million and $0.80 in the third quarter of 2015.","Cash flow from operations equaled $150 million, reduced by 100% of the GRAIL and Helix cash burn of $20 million this quarter. Q3 DSO totaled 57 days, up slightly compared to 56 days last quarter, but still healthy given the unfavorable linearity we experienced. Capital expenditures in Q3 were $57 million, and we reported an additional $84 million increase in property and equipment recorded under build-to-suit lease accounting, where such expenses were paid for by the landlord. Consequently, Q3 free cash flow was $93 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix. During the quarter, our board of directors authorized a new $250 million stock repurchase program, under which we repurchased $13 million of common stock and have $237 million of authorization remaining.","Turning now to expectations for the remainder of 2016, we expect fourth-quarter revenue to be flat to slightly up sequentially. To be more precise, slightly up should be considered an increase of up to $5 million. This guidance no longer reflects our previously expected uptick in high-throughput sequencing instruments. For fiscal 2016, we are now projecting GAAP earnings per diluted share visible to Illumina stockholders of $2.92 to $2.97, and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $3.27 to $3.32. Please refer to our investor deck for details as to the drivers of our updated guidance.","We have updated our GRAIL dilution for the year to be approximately $0.30, primarily as a result of the weight of the common shares issued by GRAIL in the first half, compared to the reduced share count in the second half, driving an inflated full-year share calculation. Our share of the GRAIL losses on a quarterly basis, including in Q3, continues to be at approximately 50%, as communicated on our last earnings call. Helix dilution is expected to be $0.10.","In closing, I would like to spend a minute on the forecast process improvement project that Francis mentioned. We have already started the initial phase, which is expected to run until mid-December, and we'll identify key opportunities for improvement including any immediate changes that we can make to enhance our visibility. We will fold the good work already underway in Europe into this process and identify areas for improving global consistency, taking the best of the best practices from each region and adding best-in-class practices where needed. This will inevitably lead to a second stage of the project next year which we anticipate will incorporate longer-term tool and process implementations. I look forward to updating you on our progress periodically.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we will now open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. I wanted to try to ask two in one here. The first part is with product cycles lengthening, have you or your assumptions around where utilization needs to go to drive another incremental purchase changed at all? And then, can you elaborate a little bit more on the HiSeq consumable mix? That's one of the things we've got a lot of questions on post- and pre-announcement.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Sure. So let me start by saying it has been a couple of years since we released the last sort of big instrument launch, but in general I wouldn't say the plan is for instrument lifecycles to get longer; they just are ready when they're ready. Now, that is independent from expectations around utilization, which is driven much more around the capacity in the market as well as the right fit of sequences for a particular application. So, the two are fairly independent from our perspective. And what was the second part of the question?","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","HiSeq consumables.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there more color on the HiSeq consumables mix? You ruled out a number of things but there certainly is still some lingering questions as to whether this is a blip or going to be more persistent?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, so we spent, as I said in the script, a bunch of time sort of analyzing what was the driver of this miss. And one of the big questions we had internally was, is there an overcapacity in the market, and we looked at the utilization of those instruments. And one of the analyses we did was look at customers who had just HiSeqs, and the 2500s, and look at what their utilization patterns were doing. And those patterns continue to be stable.","And so we are not seeing a change in the utilization of the HiSeqs in the market at all. So what we are seeing is that people are making choices around which high throughput instrument to go for. Historically, where they would've gone for a MiSeq, we're seeing some customers now go to an X for their whole genome work and, in some cases, to a NextSeq.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","And, Tycho, I would say we talked about some customer transitions as well. And for certain customers, those transitions from one platform to the other that Francis mentioned does take time. It's not dissimilar from us implementing a new system, our customers implementing a new platform, and that can cause a temporal dip. We saw that in Q3 with certain customers and I believe that that could continue into Q4.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Go ahead.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","I was just going to add that is to a select handful of customers. That isn't across the broad HiSeq installed base. To Francis' point, the broad HiSeq installed base is actually quite stable. And if you adjusted for that, that would be very much noticeable in the number.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could just ask one more. You came out after the first quarter and talked about the fact you still thought the market growth was in the mid-teens. And obviously you're going a little bit below that. But is that still your view and do you see a path back to mid-teens growth longer term?","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","I think, Tycho, that's something that we'll probably update at some point in the future, our long-term revenue expectations. But not prepared to give any update on that at this time.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Figured I'd give it a shot. Thanks.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen. Please go ahead.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. So through what I think is fair to describe as what's been a pretty poor period of execution relative to company-provided financial targets in a period which has lasted now seven quarters, sequencing consumable revenue growth has ranged between 24% year-over-year and 45% year-over-year. This in a period where total revenue growth has dropped as low as 6% year-over-year. So a two-part question.","One, are you seeing anything that leads you to question the sustainability of sequencing consumable revenue growth at robust double-digit levels? Based on your prepared remarks, it seems like while consumable revenue growth may be lumpy from line-to-line in the model, that you have a lot of conviction in the outlook for sustained consumable revenue momentum.","And then the second part is related to that, recognizing that in spite of the fact that consumables revenue growth has been robust and that you are the world's premier sequencing company, you keep missing numbers. So with that in mind, are there business model changes that need to be made to make you less susceptible to capital cycles? Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","I think those are all fair observations, Doug. I'd start by saying that the consumable growth, as you pointed out, has been reliable and robust over the last many quarters. And that for us is a good indicator of the level of the sequencing activity happening in our customer base. The volatility that we have seen has been primary driven on the instrument side over the last few quarters. We talked about some of the dynamics playing out in the Americas in Q3, where, in some cases, there were changes in funding practices that caused some customers to not spring for the capital purchase, but still look to do sequencing.","In other cases, we talked about dynamics, where customers were purchasing either Xs or going to NextSeqs instead of 4000s. So a lot of the volatility has been around the instrument dynamics. And we've seen fairly strong growth in consumables throughout that whole period. We expect that to continue. There's no reason for us to believe that that will change in the future.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","The only caveat I would add to that is, of course, the large stocking orders we've talked about in Q3 this year and we had last year. Those do have a potential effect on the comparisons going forward.","Operator","Thank you.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And obviously it's a function of the installed base growth of the prior period.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","And then, Doug, you mentioned about us missing in the execution there. I think the most important thing right now that we are focused on \u2013 one of the most important things is that visibility improvement that we need to get. Clearly, we've been surprised by some of the \u2013 we expected, for example, a big uptick in Q4 in instruments. And as Francis just mentioned, that's no longer the case. So, we need to work pretty hard to understand what's going there and how to improve that going forward. And it's going to take a little while. I think there are some immediate things we can do and have already started to do, and then we'll need some systems and tools and process improvements that we'll implement next year.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, I think the last few quarters have definitely highlighted for us areas where we need to strengthen our execution capabilities. So we identified areas in Europe earlier in the year where we thought we could do a lot better from an execution perspective. We have made a number of changes there and we're pleased with how those changes are playing out in Europe. We've identified other areas, as Marc talked about, where we can do a better job in terms of getting ahead of some of the trends that are playing out in our customer base and improve our own visibility and reporting. And so the project that Marc is driving for us will be key to that.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","And, guys, I don't know if you can still hear me, but if you can, really the core of the second part of the question was just getting at I think what's been a frustration for everybody involved, investors as well as you, you're doing well on the consumable side, sequencing demand is still robust, yet the stock moves around a lot based on what happens or what doesn't happen with capital equipment placements.","Now, you just described what you can do to improve visibility and execution. But is there anything more that you would contemplate that could make the story less about how many instruments you're placing every quarter and more about the sustained and robust consumables growth that we've seen for a while and expect to see moving forward based on what you just described?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Sure. We are looking at a number of things we can do, some of which we already have in place, that we will be talking more actively to our customers about. Things like reagent rental opportunities to get access to our instruments, also talking actively about our leasing programs. And so certainly as we look forward, we expect those to be more important part of the conversations we have. And to your point, the more we get customers into those models, the more predictable the revenue flow will be.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jon Groberg from UBS. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Maybe just to piggyback off of that, I might have got some of these numbers wrong, but I think you said you had a funnel of 90 HiSeq's, X's going into this year; 35 moved out of the second half into 2017. Can you maybe talk a little bit about \u2013 one of the big concerns that we hear from investors is HiSeq utilization sample growth continues at a nice pace. As you move into 2017, let's say that those instrument purchases may be picked back up, but you have a really difficult compare on the HiSeq X side.","So can you maybe talk a little bit about the funnel that you're seeing for X's still? And just to follow up on kind of thinking about 2017, Marc, you mentioned you need to remember $0.22 of incremental potential dilution as you move into 2017. Anything else we should be particularly aware of for 2017? Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, so let's talk about the demand for the X's. So as we look forward, we continue to expect to see orders in the range of 20 to 30 instruments a quarter. As we looked at the second half of the year when we were sitting at the midpoint of the year, we were tracking opportunities that added up to over 90 X units. And so with that, we gave the guidance we did. Now, driven by some of the things I talked about in terms of the change in the funding practices in certain U.S. government agencies, those weren't realized and we had a couple of X opportunities move out of Q3 and then one population sequencing opportunity move out of Q4 into 2017. And so, there have been specific dynamics that have caused movements of specific opportunities, but the overall demand for X continues to stay stable in that 20 to 30 units a quarter range, and we expect that to continue going into next year.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","And, Jon, just to clarify, I mean, the 90 was our funnel of opportunities that we were tracking for the second half of this year, right? So that doesn't necessarily include the parts of the funnel that are already existing for 2017 opportunities.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And the changing government funding practices doesn't necessarily mean those do occur in 2017 for that component of the 35.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","That's right. Jon, your question about headwinds or even tailwinds for 2017, I mean, we're still in the middle of building our 2017 budget right now. Just from a directional standpoint, you've got the $0.22. That's right. I'd also \u2013 a couple of other factors that will clearly affect 2017 is GRAIL and Helix and where those end up from a budgetary standpoint. Plus, both of them will have a full year versus just the partial year ramp that they've had this year. So, those are still being worked out at this moment. So, those are probably the ones I would call out at this time. Everything else will be largely business as usual.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon. Hey.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Hi Derik, good afternoon.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So can we talk a little bit about your oncology? You said sales were up, your shipments were up in oncology 24%. Could you look at this in terms of boxes and instruments and consumables and sort of parse that out? And the question I'm trying to get to here is like, we've heard from a few vendors that the reimbursement environment has been a little tough and so they've pulled back a little bit on their panel sequencing. And I'm just wondering if \u2013 could you just clarify what you're seeing in the oncology market? Is there any sort of signs of weakness in there? I mean, is the reimbursement creating the headwind in that segment?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","No, we're not seeing any of those play out in our Oncology business. We said it grew 24% year-on-year, which sort of moves up and down from quarter to quarter, given the relatively small revenue base as a percentage of our total, but we continue to see growth there. We continue to see growth in panel use across our customer base. There are some encouraging signs in terms of reimbursements that are starting to show up, and all that is driving the growth that we are seeing. So, we're not seeing the headwinds that you talked about.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And could you just give any color on the boxes versus the consumables split?","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","We don't have that level of granularity to share at this point in the year.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, we don't call that out.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then one other question, one follow-up. So, you talked about the HiSeq 2500 reagent usage being stable. I assume that a lot of that, that gets done on the HiSeq 2500s is mostly RNA-Seq applications. So, or a large chunk of that then, I'm just curious. Could you talk about \u2013 that utilization on the 2500 \u2013 could you talk about what sort of split is on RNA-Seq versus exome versus genome? And the question I'm wondering is RNA \u2013 are your RNA customers accelerating and then this might be potentially hiding the fact that some of you might be seeing some exomes and whole genome moving elsewhere? I'm just curious about the mix in terms of the 2500?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Look, RNA is an important application for us. Certainly, it's done on the HiSeq, but really it is mostly a NextSeq \u2013 it's probably most important on the NextSeq. HiSeq tends to be a workhorse instrument for us, and we do see a lot of exomes, and we see some genomes done on that instrument. So it's not driven by RNA.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","And, Derik, just to clarify, so the HiSeq \u2013 customers who only run HiSeq as their high throughput platform choice \u2013 they have been, as we mentioned in the script, stable here. Where we have seen a decline in HiSeq consumables, it's due to those transitionary points we made earlier, customers transitioning to other platforms who \u2013 in many cases you see a reduction in their HiSeq consumables and an increase in the NextSeq or HiSeq X. In some cases, when I said earlier that transition takes time, you do see a temporal dip in the total spending by those customers on consumables. So I don't think anything is being masked here by any other trends. I think it's as simple as those dynamics driving it.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And, Derik, we are seeing more genomes be sequenced, right. So \u2013 whereas a couple of years ago there was only 2% of X runs that accounted for the capacity \u2013 today that has increased to the mid-teens. And so we are seeing more whole genomes being sequenced as a proportional percentage of samples that are being run. So I think if that's what you're referring to, we would agree with that, but in general, it's not...","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","No, I'm just more curious about the 2500 utilization in essence. I know you're not doing \u2013 people are not doing a lot of whole genome \u2013 other than on the rapid run mode on the 2500. It's more about \u2013 it's more about just \u2013 it's more and more about a cannibalization question on that. But I'll take it offline. I'll follow it up with you later.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","And our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good afternoon, guys. Francis, can you just comment on the HiSeq upgrade cycle in general? What percentage of the 2500s have been turned over at this point? And what at this point is a reasonable expectation just in terms of the portion of the installed base that might eventually convert?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Sure. We actually don't provide those kind of specific numbers around the percentage of the installed base that's upgraded, so I can't break it down there. I can say that the upgrades were what was driving a lot of the demand for the 3000 and 4000. But the 2500s have been remarkably sticky \u2013 for people who have liked the rapid run mode there \u2013 people that have had validated workflows that they've been running on the 2500, which has caused them to continue to be good workhorse instruments in production. So, we don't really break down any more specific than that.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. If I could maybe ask a follow-up on your comment on the favorable economics of the X System, what is your sense at this point for how much of the next wave of sequencing work or demand might be tied to the next step down in the cost of sequencing? And then along those lines, just given that it does look like cost is a factor, I'm curious why you think customers might be seeking out the lower price point that the X offers, but maybe not looking for the whole genome cost advantage of the 4000 versus NextSeq when it comes time to buy a box?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yes. So, we continue to hear from our research customers especially, that there are lots of projects that they would like to take on, and they will do that as the price of sequencing comes down. And so, whether it's much deeper sequencing they want to do in oncology research, or more single cell research, there are a whole set of projects that we hear about from customers that they don't feel they can take on at this price point, but they are looking forward to the price points continuing to go down. So, I continue to deeply believe in the elasticity of the demand in the research customers.","The reality is that we understand so little of the functionality of the genome in almost any area that you can think of, that I believe that there's a lot more sequencing to be done, and a lot of it will be enabled through lower price points. So that's sort of one point.","I think that what we are seeing is customers making the decision to do whole genome have the potential to look at both the 4000 and the X, and the economics associated with the X are still significantly better than the 4000. And so, that's why they're \u2013 that's what's driving the decision I talked about in my remarks whereas, if they have any kind of volume around whole genome or they have access to a whole genome sequencing service, those economics can be very compelling for some customers.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys. So, as we think about some of the markets over time that you guys have highlighted or applications, and the pacing at which penetration has occurred in each of them, whether it be in parts of clinical or applied, et cetera, where do you think maybe something like NIPT, where we've sort of maybe gotten to a grander scale than we had envisioned 12, 24, 36 months ago, where do you think, what other markets have we sort of seen better penetration than one would have expected? And then, where have you seen things kind of generally move slowly, and how does it make you think about the pacing of adoption in terms of time versus the ultimate size of the opportunity, which I'm guessing in many of these cases like in oncology, et cetera, probably hasn't changed?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, it's a great question, so I'll start with where you started with NIPT. And I'll agree with you that clearly the pace of that market has not lived up to our expectations, and that if you look at where we are as we come to the end of this year, we are around 30% of covered lives in the U.S. have access to NIPT testing, and we expected that would be further along than it is. That's still coming, and so we expect that will play out in 2017 and beyond, but we did expect to be further along than we are today.","There are areas that did perform a lot better. So for example, the growth that we're seeing in China has been ahead of where we expected to be. Some of it is driven by the Chinese PMI and customers buying as part of the Chinese PMI. Some of it has been customers buying in anticipation of being a service provider to the Chinese PMI projects. But a lot of it is driven by adoption, clinical adoption in the Chinese market, and that has been further ahead than where we'd expected. China is already now our number two country market in the world. And so that's been an area that has moved faster than we expected.","The whole genome sequencing market has moved further and faster than we'd expected. We've touched on in the remarks that, today, whole genome sequencing represents 15% of the sequencing done in high-throughput instruments. That's up from 2% just two years ago. And that's vastly exceeded our expectations.","We're starting to hear from a lot of customers, on the research side certainly, that they do want to move to whole genome sequencing and that they see that as a very evolutionary natural next step for them in their research to get a better handle on the biology involved. So that's been another area that I'd say has gone better than we'd expected.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. And I'm going to apologize, Marc, before I ask the question because I'm going to make you repeat yourself again, but I have a lot of questions in the inbox just on the Q4 and then into 2017 cadence of the benefit we saw this quarter, the reversal next quarter and then through that accrual dilution and then tie that in with the GRAIL dilution in the second half. So, again, maybe through repetition some of us can actually walk through this a little bit easier.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","So just to clarify and it's no problem going through it again, the benefit that we saw this quarter I already mentioned in terms of the dollar effect of that. And then the same for next quarter. So let's recap those. About a $13 million benefit this quarter and $6 million benefit next quarter.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","$13 million to OpEx.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","To OpEx, I'm sorry. So that's a total of $19 million. And I think when you look at that relative to the second half guidance, it's about an $0.11 benefit for the second half.","The $0.22 headwind for next year contemplates 100%, going back to 100%. So bear in mind that what you're seeing here as the benefit in the second half of this year takes us from where we were coming into Q3 to where we expect to be coming out of Q4. So it's only a second half effect, whereas the $0.22 is a full-year impact. Does that make sense?","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Yeah. And then the incremental GRAIL dilution from the shares being higher.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Yes. So the way that that works is, on a quarterly basis, when you look at quarterly EPS, you take into account our ownership of GRAIL. And in the first two quarters of the year, it was around 90% and in the second two quarters it's around 50%. And that's what we communicated we'd accomplished last quarter. But when you do either a year-to-date or a full-year basis, you take the weighted average of the shares over the number of quarters included. So on a full year, it's over four quarters; on a year-to-date, it's over three quarters.","And of course in the way we did that particular transaction, in the first two quarters there were more shares in that calculation than there are in the second two quarters. So when you do that weighted average effect over four quarters for a full year, it equates to more like 80%, even above 80% of the losses that we would record instead of the 50% that we're now down to for the quarter.","So what that means, if you take it to its natural conclusion, is that four quarters don't sum to the full year EPS. And there's a chart in our Investor deck that clearly shows that that happens. And that's just the way the accounting works.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Got it. That helps. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just had a couple of questions here on some commentary you've made. So first on the NextSeq. You mentioned that there's workflow benefits to that platform. Could you give us a little more detail around what types of applications you're seeing shifting to the NextSeq? Is it something that's been going on for some period of time? And is there anything that you can leverage from that platform into other platforms to drive increased performance?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, so one application that is starting to \u2013 we're getting a lot of traction on NextSeq is on NIPT. And so we see a lot of our customers that are running LVTs move to the NextSeq. And what they like is the flexible workflows. They like the fact that they don't have to batch as many samples as they would have to with the HiSeq. And that's a phenomenon that's been building. And so it's not been building just this quarter, it's been building overtime. And I think it's important, the V2 chemistry was an important step for us with the NextSeq, where there was an initial period where people were looking to see the quality of the runs on NextSeq compared to the other instruments, the four channel instruments.","And with the V2, customers started to get comfortable that we had achieved parity in the quality of the output that they could get. And they started trialing those instruments and validating them. And so, this is a trend that's been building. There are definitely things we are taking away from that on a number of areas.","One is we are really pleased with the traction that we're seeing, for example, with two-channel chemistry and the benefit that it gives to our customers. And so internally, that's something we're thinking through how we leverage that even more broadly.","There are other lessons we're taking, NIPT is one of those markets where we have focused specifically around the end-to-end workflow and making our solution easy for our customers to consume in the NIPT market. And you see that with the VeriSeq launch that we're doing as well. And for us, that represents a good way for us to get good traction in the applied markets. And so that's another lesson we're taking from the success we're seeing in NextSeq.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","And is it fair to say that that's probably mostly in the U.S. then, just given that o-U.S. it seems like people were starting more with NextSeq than NIPT?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","No, we're seeing that in countries outside the U.S., too. For example, we're seeing that certainly in China, is another good example of a NextSeq market.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","It will continue to be the case next year when we launch VeriSeq and NIPT in Europe with CE Mark.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And I just had a quick follow-up to Dan's question on the X. So historically you've given us some context around what the run rate looks like on SBS chemistry just more broadly. Is there a way you can help us think about that same concept on the X? So just thinking about the platform that's out there now and assuming that you don't have to make major instrumentation changes, how much more runway do you have there in terms of thinking about cost per genome or whatever metric on what's out there today?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, obviously I can only answer that question at a very high level. But I'll say that we are really optimistic about the headroom that all of our core technologies have. So the SBS chemistry, the flow cells and so on. And so from a technology perspective, we certainly believe that we have head room to push the performance of the X number of dimensions.","For us, the question is always going to be also around what the market needs to unlock the elasticity and how much of that will be driven by price point, how much of it will be driven by informatics and so on. But from a capability perspective, I think we have good line of sight into continued improvements on the X but also on our other instruments.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone. Two quick kind of I guess interrelated questions. I guess first, Marc, would you be so kind to elaborate on the new forecasting project and I'm thinking maybe you can give us an example of a process that will be changed as a result of this. And then again, somewhat related, just help us think a little bit about what, I guess, what would potentially stop additional customers from transitioning to other platforms and obviously disrupting your consumables flow like we saw in this quarter. Thanks.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, I would say, so on the forecasting project, I'd think of it in terms of both our visibility and predictability of the pipeline. So, there are a number of different things that we can do including connecting the market insights that we have as well as improving the market insights that we have and connecting those to the forecasted pipeline. And driving more discipline around our CRM database, around our pipeline definitions and so on. It's much broader than just forecasting, Bill, which is why I said this can continue into next year.","I mean, it's between the sales process and the forecasting process itself. We might need to make changes in both areas. I think we do it really well in certain spots in a number of regions, and as we've always said, we felt like Americas had a very disciplined process, but I think we don't do it as consistently globally as we probably, as I know we can. And so driving global consistency in the way that we do it, with the items we look at, the dashboards we use, even the taxonomy, the what do you mean by defining opportunity versus upside and those kinds of things. Like I say, in some places we do that really well, but I'd like to drive more global consistency around that.","And then your second question on transitions. I think generally, it's okay for us if our customers are transitioning to other products and platforms. There's normally a good reason for that and we still believe in elasticity and over time, that revenue comes back. The fact that it causes a dip as those customers transition, I think is just part, kind of goes with the territory. And so, key there again, back to the forecast process is our ability to predict that versus being surprised by that. But the actual dynamic itself I don't think is one we need to worry about, as long as our customers don't take multiple years to transition, which would be more damaging to their business than it is to us.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Of course. Understood. Thank you. And then just one real quick follow-up, which is the X order that slipped out of the quarter, was that a 5 or a 10? Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","We didn't say. It was a large X order.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thanks, Francis.","Operator","And our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Want to spend a minute on expenses. If I look at sort of your guidance for the balance of 2016, was hoping you could maybe give us a sense of the SG&A aspect of the spend and to the extent that informs a run rate, it was a little bit lighter than we expected. This quarter I'm sure that will rebound a little bit into year-end, but wanted to hopefully get a sense of a normalized run rate going forward.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, Isaac. I mean, one of the reasons that it was \u2013 the SG&A was lighter this quarter \u2013 was back to that compensation. By the way, I want to make sure I correct that because I misspoke earlier when I was answering Ross's question. In Q3, we saw a $16 million benefit, not $13 million as I said, and in Q4 it was $6 million. But that was one of the key drivers there. We're in the middle, as I said earlier, of our 2017 budgeting right now. And of course, as we do that, we're going to be very cognizant of our spending rates and so on. And we are going to continue to invest in sales team and people who carry a quota; that's clear.","But the normal balance we go through every year is trading off between how much can we spend on R&D and as you can tell, it's trending up quite high and much higher than our peer group because we believe in the technology and the head room that Francis mentioned earlier, but the trade-off might be with sales and marketing or even G&A. I try to drive G&A down and provide leverage to drive it down as a percentage of revenue and that will always be the case, but we'll make trade-offs between R&D and sales and marketing.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And remember, Isaac, that Marc's commentary is primarily associated with core Illumina and that GRAIL and Helix are going to continue to ramp throughout the year, and those obviously, will increase operating expenses for our consolidated financials as a result.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. That makes sense. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on GRAIL hoping that you could provide an update, I think last we heard, assay design hopefully on track to sort of be finalized early next year. Wondering if that's still the case and if you could comment on their progress? Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yes. So the GRAIL team is making really good progress. We will at some point schedule a broader update on where we are with GRAIL. What you have seen is the team has started work on the circulating cell-free tumor outputs. (55:01) And that data we expect to come out in the back half of next year. And so while the team is making good progress on defining the assay and is roughly on track, we expect the data that comes out of that will lead to some modifications of the assay. The team continues to recruit an incredibly strong team, and so we are pleased with the progress they're making; we're very pleased with the talent level of the team that we're building there, too.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Just two quick follow-ups for me. First, is on arrays. I thought the commentary on arrays and the growth sustainability there, it sounded a bit more positive on the sustainability that we've heard in the past. In the past, we've heard about a mix of volume and offsetting price. Can you speak a little bit to the mix between volume and price that you're seeing now in arrays and how those evolved into \u2013 to get you to your view that there is a pretty sustainable healthy growth profile?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah, I think it's a fair read of sort of our take on the market, that we are seeing strength in that market, driven by a number of factors that I will talk about. And internally, the team that runs it calls it an array-asance and what's driving that momentum are a number of things. One is the direct-to-consumer business, we're seeing real strength from our customers in that segment, exceeding frankly our expectations substantially, and so that's driving some of the growth you're seeing in that market. We talked about the strength of the Ag business, and those are some fairly large orders that we're taking in that market. And so those create a very healthy backlog for us and give us cause to be optimistic about the revenue flows for the array business.","That's a business that I think really benefits from elasticity and so I think you'll see both play out. You'll see prices continue to go down as we move to routine testing in sort of the Ag business, and you'll see these lower prices drive more demand as we're seeing in the direct-to-consumer business as well. So, it's a great example of real strong elasticity in a market.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, I would love to hear updated perspective from you on the ramp of the commercial opportunity at Helix. I appreciate that this is still early, but just watching the flow of press releases on partnership announcements from Helix over the last couple of months, I thought it would be a helpful topic to cover here as we think about planning for the model and where consumer could go. Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. That's a great question, and you're right. There have been a number of partners that have been signed up to Helix and a number of announcements about those partners. So, I think there are partners like obviously Mayo and LabCorp and Duke and Good Start Genetics and National Geographic and Invitae, but also sort of interesting partners like the team from ExploraGen. And what they are doing is they're creating an application that harnesses DNA and the science of taste to create personalized culinary experiences.","And their first application is the vinome or Vinome. And what they want to do is to create a direct-to-consumer application that will match wine to consumers. And so, that's an example of an application that we couldn't have predicted and frankly, we were hoping to see by launching a platform like Helix, to encourage all sorts of experimentation and interesting applications show up. And we're seeing that even beyond what we've announced to the public.","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","And, Steve, Helix is really driving a really interesting pipeline of opportunities in all areas of whether it be health or wellness, or genealogy or whatever. It's really interesting what they're doing. The key next step really I think for Helix is kind of the product launch, and that's what the team is focused on right now.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Marc, just still trying to think about maybe the run rate for the GRAIL dilution going into 2017. I mean, it looks like it's going to be like $0.15 in Q4, but I know that's not the run rate. Is there any way you can help us think about how we should be modeling that into next year?","Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc.","I'm not sure where you got the $0.15, unless you including this $0.08 of incremental, and I wouldn't do that. The $0.08 of incremental is a 2016 full-year issue. Now, it could happen again that way if there are any changes in the common stock of GRAIL. So that's something we need to account for going forward, but as I mentioned just now, the EPS impact of GRAIL in this quarter was $0.05. So, that's after all the non-controlling interest calculations and everything else; that doesn't include the $0.08. So, $0.05 is the current run rate. Q4 \u2013 I'm expecting \u2013 you saw where I took the dilution up by a couple of cents. I'm expecting expenses to ramp a little bit higher in Q4, and then that will determine the run rate going forward. And then the next question is to what extent does GRAIL continue to grow their spending in 2017? And that's part of the budget decision that we are all in the middle of right now. Does that help?","Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Yes, it does. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Rebecca Chambers for closing remarks.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks, Katie, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon.

As we shared a few weeks ago, we had a stronger than expected finish to 2016. Q4 revenue equaled $619 million, driven by robust sequencing consumables growth and strong demand for our microarray portfolio. Revenue grew 8% to $2.4 billion for the full year with sequencing consumable and microarray growth offset by declines in sequencing instruments.","Geographically, Asia-Pacific saw impressive growth as revenue increased 29% in Q4 versus the prior year, propelled by China, which grew approximately 50%. Europe grew 11%, driven in part by year-end spending. Americas revenue declined 4% due to lower high throughput sequencing instrument shipments. Demand from oncology testing customers continued to grow and led to annual shipments of $260 million, an increase of 20% versus 2015.","Products like the RUO version of TruSight Tumor 170, or TST 170, that we launched in the fourth quarter are enabling and accelerating the adoption of genomics in this market. TST 170's enrichment-based target panel simultaneously analyzes DNA and RNA and assesses the mutation status of genes commonly associated with solid tumors to provide a deep view of the underlying genetics of the cancer. The IUO version of this product will be available in the fourth quarter for pharma companies and their partners to assess patients for clinical trials.","In NIPT, we continue to see positive reimbursement trends in the U.S., and today coverage for average risk testing exceeds 100 million lives. Additionally, we are pleased that many of our largest customers who were previously sending samples to our facility are now running their own tests. And, as a result, sequencing consumables for NIPT grew approximately 65% versus the prior year. With the transition to in-house testing complete at two large customers, we expect more stable test (04:06) volumes as well as continued growth in sequencing instruments and consumable sales.","To further foster NIPT adoption in Europe, we recently announced the application of the CE mark on our expanded VeriSeq NIPT Analysis Software. Newly designed for 48 samples versus the current 16 samples, clinical labs will now have access to highly accurate, fast and reliable software for analysis of sequencing data for NIPT. We expect to launch our CE marked VeriSeq NIPT solution shortly, which we believe will further catalyze this market.","Moving now to platforms, a few weeks ago, we introduced NovaSeq, a brand new architecture designed from the ground-up to be the most powerful sequencer available. Since the launch, we have hosted webinars with more than 1,000 attendees and embarked on a three-city road show hosting more than 300 customers.","At these events, we have demonstrated the innovation underlying the platform as well as the workflow enhancements and flexibility of the system. The feedback from these sessions have been very positive. Supporting our view that NovaSeq will encourage customers to perform higher powered studies to analyze larger swaths of the genome, including whole genome sequencing at greater depth, again demonstrating the elasticity of the genomics market.","Additionally, initial interest is aligned with our expectation that this platform will drive sequencing instrument growth via a multiyear replacement cycle starting now at most of the 800 active HiSeq customers and in future years at HiSeq X customers.","NovaSeq is expected to reinvigorate demand for high throughput instruments, which declined in the fourth quarter, as anticipated. This led to Q4 sequencing instrument revenue of $111 million, down 23% versus the prior year. HiSeq shipments were in line with our expectations. We exited the year with approximately 35 HiSeq X customers and 37 HiSeq X instruments in backlog, which are candidates for conversion to NovaSeq.","NextSeq shipments and orders both grew sequentially as commercial customers scale capacity in part to help satisfy NIPT demand in the U.S. and China. Interest in MiniSeq continues to ramp and, in the fourth quarter, we shipped more than 110 instruments. We witnessed steady MiSeq demand and now have 5,300 instruments installed. With MiSeqDx now cleared across 20 countries, our outlook for this product remains stable.","Before moving to arrays, I'd like to share that we have decided to end-of-life the NeoPrep instrument. We have deprioritized work on additional applications in favor of more promising investment opportunities. We have a robust plan to support our customers and for those that wish to continue use of their instrument, we will maintain supply of TruSeq Nano DNA and Stranded mRNA kits for the next year.","In Q4, microarray revenue grew 14% year-over-year to approximately $100 million, bolstered in parts by year-end spending. Continued consumer demand, which increased over 60%, shipments of our Global Screening Array and demand for our Infinium XT family of products drove this record quarter. Our array backlog has grown to the highest level since 2012, benefiting growth in 2017 and beyond.","We've also made good progress in building out our leadership team and adding talented individuals to our board. On that note, I'd like to welcome Caroline Dorsa to Illumina's Board of Directors as well as Garret Hampton, Jonathan Seaton, and Sam Samad to our management team. A year ago, we created the Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer role overseeing all G&A functions including finance and asked Marc Stapley to take this on. I'd like to thank Marc for his many contributions as CFO over the past five years and look forward to his continued leadership as he hands the CFO reins to Sam.","I will now turn this call over to Sam for a detailed overview of our fourth quarter results.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Thank you, Francis. As Francis mentioned, Q4 revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $619 million, consistent with our preliminary estimates on January 9. Fourth quarter consumable revenue represented 66% of total revenue or $407 million, an increase of 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015.","Sequencing consumable revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $331 million. As a result of growth in our installed base, increased HiSeq X utilization and gains in NextSeq pull-through, which again reached the top end of our $100,000 or $150,000 guidance range.","MiSeq pull-through was in our projected range of $40,000 to $45,000 and MiniSeq utilization equaled $24,000. We ended the year with 370 active MiniSeq instruments, which we now forecast will generate annual consumables of $20,000 to $25,000 per box. HiSeq and HiSeq X utilization were within their respective guidance ranges of $300,000 to $350,000 and $625,000 to $725,000.","Going forward, we plan to report a combined pull-through figure for this family of instruments, which is expected to decline as customers use fewer HiSeq consumables or fully decommissioned instruments. Utilization on the HiSeq family of instruments will depend upon the rate of adoption of the new platform.","Services and other revenue equaled $94 million. Strength in genotyping services and sequencing instrument maintenance contracts was offset by an expected decline in NIPT service revenue, as customers migrated to in-house testing.","Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders.","Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 69.9%, lower sequentially by 260 basis points, including 150 basis points of product transition reserves associated with the end-of-life of NeoPrep as well as the HiSeq family. In addition, we have scaled manufacturing operations. Given this investment is to support future growth, it will take several quarters to be more fully absorbed. Finally, the variable compensation accrual benefits we saw in Q3 contributed to the sequential decline. As a result of these last two factors, as well as the introduction of a new platform, which historically depresses gross margins, we are forecasting margins to be roughly flat sequentially, but growing later in the year.","Adjusted research and development expenses in Q4 were $121 million, or 19.5% of revenue, an increase of $7 million over Q3, and adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter equaled $130 million, or 20.9% of revenue, an increase of $13 million sequentially.","Adjusted operating margins were 29.5% compared to 34.4% in the third quarter, lower primarily due to the variable compensation accrual benefits we saw in Q3, as well as Q4 gross margin impacts previously discussed and head count addition. Operating margin was lower compared to the 33.4% reported in the fourth quarter of last year due to increased investments in manufacturing, head count, GRAIL and Helix. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 33.9%, a sequential decrease of 430 basis points, again, related to the gross margin impact and variable compensation accrual benefits we saw in Q3.","Stock-based compensation expense equaled $27 million, down sequentially from $35 million and lower than expected due primarily to the timing of executive departures and appointments. In 2017, stock-based compensation is expected to be 6% of revenue on average and, going forward, we will report gross margin, R&D, SG&A and operating margin including the respective allocations of this charge. This is consistent with the treatment of the expense in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share figures.","We reported fourth quarter GAAP net income of $124 million and EPS of $0.84 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $126 million or $0.85 of EPS with GRAIL and Helix dilution of $0.05 and $0.03, respectively. This led to 2016 non-GAAP EPS of $3.33, including GRAIL and Helix dilution of $0.27 and $0.09, respectively.","Cash flow from operations equaled $280 million, reduced by 100% of the GRAIL and Helix cash burn of $33 million this quarter. Q4 DSO totaled 56 days, down slightly compared to 57 days last quarter, due to the benefit of higher revenue and strong collections. Capital expenditures in Q4 were $82 million, and we reported an additional $25 million increase in property and equipment recorded under build-to-suit lease accounting, where such expenses were paid for by the landlord.","Consequently, Q4 free cash flow was $199 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, including the consolidated cash balances of GRAIL and Helix.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares under our previously announced buyback programs at an average price of $129, leaving us with approximately $100 million of remaining authorization.","Moving now to guidance, we are projecting Q1 revenue of $580 million to $595 million with the low-end of our range reflecting an ability to manufacture and recognize a dozen NovaSeqs and the upper end two dozen instruments. We believe high throughput customers will choose to wait to purchase the NovaSeq platform and, as a result, expect to ship approximately 10 HiSeq instruments in the first quarter, including HiSeq X.","Additionally, as we work through the transition from HiSeq to NovaSeq, customers will pause experiments, work down consumables on hand, place fewer inventory buys, and take time to validate their new workflow. Hence, consumable sales will also be impacted as a result of this transition leading to decelerating sequencing consumable growth versus prior year for a number of quarters and flat to slightly down sequencing consumables sequentially.","As we previously shared, total company revenue is expected to grow 10% to 12% in 2017, including less than 1% revenue contribution from each of GRAIL and Helix, as well as a 100 basis point currency headwind versus the prior year, given current rates. We are forecasting Q1 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.51 to $0.56 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.60 to $0.65. For the full year, GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $3.25 to $3.35 and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.60 to $3.70.","Our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes no meaningful impact to tax expense from the new stock-based compensation pronouncement. We will report GAAP results that reflect the impact of this guidance and our non-GAAP results will exclude the impact on our effective tax rate due to the potential volatility and so that our results are comparable to prior periods.","Our Q1 and full year EPS guidance does not include any one-time items associated with the close of the GRAIL Series B, which we have assumed is completed by the end of Q1. We have included $0.08 of dilution from the consolidation of GRAIL's financial results in the first quarter only and $0.18 of Helix dilution for the full year.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional question. Operator, we'll now open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I'm going to ask a couple on NovaSeq. I know you're not going to say a lot, but wondering if you can give us an update on orders relative to what you said back in January at our conference. Any thoughts on how we should think about trading dynamics relative to 2500 on the basis of throughput capacity? Anything you're willing to say about initial consumable pull-through expectations? And then, lastly, when you think you'll work through the manufacturing constraints? Thanks.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Tycho, that's a lot more than one question.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","You may not answer it all, but it's worth a shot.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Francis is (17:37)","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","All right. Let me see if I've got them all. So, the first one was about sort of any update on orders. So, we had really good commercial activity since we announced at JPMorgan. We think we have had orders since then, but we think it's too early to start talking about order numbers. And so you can expect us probably to give you an update on the next earnings call, but we're happy with the level of activity, although we don't have an order number to announce on this call.","In terms of trading dynamics, I think what you'll see is \u2013 and there's two parts to this answer. In terms of the backlog, we are allowing customers that have ordered either HiSeqs or Xs that are in backlog to look at purchasing NovaSeqs instead. And we expect the majority of them will purchase NovaSeqs. We expect although there are going to be some customers and there are, we're hearing already, that will continue to purchase either the X that they had \u2013 probably the X that they had planned. And that's because they could have experiments that are underway and they don't want to switch instruments in the middle of an experiment, or they're looking at the economics and saying, look, until S4 comes out, the X is still a good instrument for them. And that's the dynamic we expect to play out over the course of this year.","In terms of pull-through, it is too early and so we'll watch it play out over the next few quarters. What we will be doing, though, is we'll start to give you a combined pull-through number for our high throughput portfolio, but that will take a little time to play out so we can get a number that makes sense to publish.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","And a combined number, just to clarify, for HiSeq and HiSeq X. And when we eventually have a good sense of what the NovaSeq pull-through looks like, we will probably give a range for that at that point.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. And I think the last part of your question was around how we're doing on the manufacturing side. And, look, our development and manufacturing and operations team are full speed ahead and we are on track for a first quarter launch of NovaSeq. The last \u2013 the pilot builds are wrapping up their final assembly and a number of the pilot builds are now going through design verification testing. It's very exciting to see the first production units on the manufacturing floor. The exact number we end up shipping this quarter will depend upon, obviously, how the next few weeks play out. And also we are keen to make sure that the first NovaSeq customers have a great experience and so we're looking through the demand we have and picking the sites that we want to ship to as well as the number of units per site. So, all that will factor into the actual number we put out in this quarter.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And, Tycho, one thing to add on the order commentary that Francis provided, it wouldn't be typical of us to be able to update that at this point in time. For an instrument like NovaSeq, the sales cycle is typically months, not necessarily weeks. And so while we do have a couple of fast-acting customers who have been able to get us orders in the last few weeks, we never really expected to share that because we think it's not representative of the entirety of the demand that will generate in the first quarter. So, we do look forward to sharing that figure on the first quarter call. And, in between now and then, it's all about demand generation and getting that HiSeq customer really excited about the platform attributes of the NovaSeq.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. I appreciate all the color.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company.","Adam Wieschhaus - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi there. This is Adam on for Doug. Thanks for taking my questions. China has been a source of strength for you guys over the last several quarters and I think you mentioned you had 50% revenue growth in Q4. Could you provide any further commentary on what drove growth in China in Q4? And is the China PMI progressing as you had expected in terms of instrument demand and utilization? Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Adam. There are a number of trends that are driving the demand we're seeing in China. Part of it is, as you point out, demand associated with the China PMI and we're seeing customers that are buying X instruments in anticipation of the work that will come out from the Chinese PMI initiative. But there are other dynamics playing out too. We are continuing to see growth in the NIPT market in China and that's driving demand for us. There have been incremental progress in terms of the opening up the number of labs in China that can do NIPT and so that continues to be a robust market for us. And then we are seeing growth in oncology testing play out in China as well. So, all of those are contributing to that 50% growth that we saw last quarter.","Adam Wieschhaus - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And for my follow-up, you noticed a shift in the U.S. Government funding practices led to smaller project disbursements in Q3, which impacted capital commitments that quarter. Did these dynamics persist in Q4? And if so, is this fund that you expect \u2013 a trend you expect to continue going forward? Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","So, what we said in Q3 was we noticed in a couple of agencies a change in the funding dynamic and that impacted because we had a couple of deals associated with those agencies. We didn't see any change in how the other agencies fund their projects and so we didn't really see any impact of that in Q4.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","And I would say the change in the agencies that we're talking about, there's nothing \u2013 no reason for us to assume that's not going to continue under the new approach that they've adopted. We don't see an end in sight to that.","Adam Wieschhaus - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is from Jonathan Groberg of UBS.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, thanks a million. So, one more on the NovaSeq and then one on arrays. On NovaSeq, what's your kind of sense as to what percent of the HiSeq that you have out there, the 1,900 or so, excluding the Xs, are potentially moving to upgrade given the volume that they do and your conversation with customers, are you getting any sense as to the ratio at which you're expecting customers to upgrade from their existing platform to NovaSeq? And then on the array business, just curious what your expectations are for that? It sounds like consumer genomics \u2013 the consumer array had another strong quarter in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Thanks, Jonathan. So, I'll start by saying this. We've talked about the fact that for our HiSeq portfolio, we have 1,900 instruments, so we have 800 customers. And I think the right way to think about it is to work from the number of customers up rather than number of instruments down. And so, we have started the conversation with all of the 800 customers that are HiSeq customers, and there is going to be interest we think in the majority of them in the coming years to upgrade specifically to NovaSeq. I think there'll be a small number of that potentially look at NextSeq as well. But I think you will see nearly that entire base turnover over the next few years. And the focus, in fact, of this year is to really focus on that base primarily.","Now, once we get the S4 out towards the end of the year, we'll also be working the X customer base as well, but the focus this year is to target those 800 customers and we fully expect that the vast majority of them will become NovaSeq customers in the coming years.","I caught that third part of your question was around the consumer market?","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Expectations for growth in array business?","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","I'm happy to handle that. Obviously, the array business grew very well in 2016 and fueled largely by the consumer business, but also a couple other areas that we cited in the call. And so, we are expecting growth in 2017, but it will be lower than the growth for the company overall.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Arias of Citigroup.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks. Francis, maybe to your last point, I know you are not trying to look too far down the road, but as we try to understand how the S4 configuration phases in, can you just help us with the way that you see X systems being utilized once that happens? I mean, to your point, it sounds like genome centers want the economics associated with the S4 specifically for whole genome work. So, I guess, how are you thinking about X system usage once they have the S4 capabilities and how should we think about the consumables pull-through relative to current levels once the S4 is out?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. Sure. I mean, once the S4 launches \u2013 and we talked about a 20% sort of economic benefit to going to NovaSeq in S4 over running an X. And we think that will drive customers over time to move their workloads from an X to an S4\/NovaSeq and we expect it to be a phased rollout. I think there will be a small set that may want to do most of their fleets, but I think you'll see other customers bring in NovaSeq and move their workflows to the NovaSeq S4 combination using their Xs as sort of overflow capacity until over time they've migrated their fleet over to two NovaSeqs. We'll also see some customers I expect that are X shops that bring in NovaSeqs to take on the workloads that are being done by their HiSeqs and use that as a way to get experience with NovaSeqs even before the S4 comes out and really take over the workloads that are being done on the rest of the HiSeq portfolio.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. If I could just sneak in one follow-up. Do you see negative demand at all being impacted by the Nova box? I mean, obviously, that's aimed at a bit of a different workload, but I'm just wondering whether or to the extent which customers or institutions kind of put their whole instrument purchase process under review as they look at the NovaSeq, particularly given that it seems like last quarter you did comment on NextSeq siphoning a bit of the HiSeq demand?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","I think it will have an incremental impact and the incremental impact will be that over time I think you will see customers sort of making the decision and say, okay, if I look at my entire fleet, it will be simplified to the high throughput part of that fleet instead of having all the combinations they have today between the different flavors of HiSeq and the X that will all be consolidated down to and the answer is the NovaSeq. And so, as they look at the fleet they want to run, even in a genome center, it will be NovaSeq and then NextSeq is the sort of mid box. So, I think there will be an incremental benefit from that dynamic for NextSeq as everybody sees it as part of the portfolio of the future, but I think that will just be an incremental benefit.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question is from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good afternoon.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Hi, Derik.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Hi, Derik.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. So, as you sort of ramp up the NovaSeq and you sort of swap them out, I mean, you're going to also lose some service contracts considering that you're going to be swapping either two for one or three for one on those. So, how do you sort of tend to look at the service contributions from the service \u2013 going forward on that?","And another question along on the NovaSeq is, you're going from a four-color to a two-color chemistry, similar to what you have in the NextSeq. Is there enough data available to the scientists that are out there to analyze it to get people comfortable or is there going to be some prolonged evaluation process as people sort of get comfortable and want to switch their workflows over?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, maybe I'll start with the two-channel chemistry and the four-channel chemistry. So, we had, as you know, two-channel chemistry out now for a while with the NextSeq and so I think people have had some experience with two-channel chemistry. In addition, we've actually put out some data on NovaSeq that we're showing customers and we expect to show even more data at AGBT coming up. So I think there is a decent similarity and some comfort now with two-channel, but there will be customers that want to spend some time really looking at the data that we put out at AGBT, but it's not new like it was when we came out with the NextSeq.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Would you want to cover the services one?","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. On the services question, Derik, I think it will have an impact obviously as customers decommission or stop using or stop renewing their services contracts on existing legacy HiSeq instruments. But with the kind of rollout being more of a ramp throughout the year and mostly the instruments will be shipped in Q2 and the decommissioning will \u2013 Q2 and beyond and the decommissioning will tend to lag that. I think it's a fairly marginal impact and it's included in our guidance to the extent it's going to happen this year. And then once you get past the first year of NovaSeq, you start to charge instrument contracts for that as well. So, it tends to offset.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So if I can sneak a quick one in, I think some people are little bit surprised at the $580 million to $595 million revenue number in Q1, 3% growth year-over-year, 10% to 12% for the full year. Can you sort of bridge us the revenue pacing that you're sort of looking at so the cell-size models can get a little bit more homogenized?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","I wouldn't bridge by quarter in terms of pacing, but I think the way to think about it is we gave that figure for Q1 because the entirety of a high throughput portfolio is being impacted by this launch and that's a significant quarterly revenue number. We talked about 10 HiSeqs of HiSeq Xs combined in Q1 and we've talked about a dozen to two dozen NovaSeq. So, doing that math, you can see the potential headwind in the first quarter on that part of the portfolio. And then Sam mentioned and talked about the four items \u2013 the four ways that consumables can get impacted. And so, as a result of that, consumables in the first quarter could be flat to down somewhat. So, those combined factors is that's what leads to the $580 million to $595 million in the first quarter.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And I think, Derik, I think the most important point on this topic is that, obviously, this was contemplated in our full year revenue guidance and we did share at JPMorgan that the high throughput portfolio will be impacted as a result of this launch. And so while the actual figures obviously weren't out there that that conversation has been relatively active over the last few years.","Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question comes from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys. One of the other things you sort of talked about at JPMorgan was the path to the $100 genome. Obviously, number of years away, but that's sort of in concept something pretty transformational in the market. I mean, what's been the feedback particularly from clinical or translational customers on sort of what that enables and, I guess, how is it sort of helping frame your thinking in terms of how some of these studies we've been waiting to kind of come to market maybe catalyze or not catalyze, but add sort of elasticity?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Ross. That's a great question. One of the great things that happened since JPMorgan is that announcement has had the effect we're hoping, in that it's ignited imagination across a lot of our customers. And we've had some terrific conversations about the kinds of projects that could be enabled as we walk our way down to the $100 genome.","In fact, we had a terrific presentation from one of our customers at our sales kick-off that talked about where we could go potentially with single-cell work as the price of sequencing and genome continues to drop. That was the effect we wanted to have and it's definitely catalyzed that thinking. Obviously then now everybody is inpatient and everybody wants the $100 genome now and that's good too because it shows us that there is a demand for it, there is an interest for it.","The interest so far has been a lot on the research side, honestly around what could be enabled. And if there is some interest on the clinical side that I stated the biggest \u2013 sort of the biggest catalyst to growth in the clinic are not necessarily pricing ones along right now, but definitely it's created a lot of fantastic conversations.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","And maybe just more quickly in terms of, once the Series B for GRAIL is done, updated thoughts or any color on what the size of the repurchase may look like or help us frame how to think about that in the course of the guidance, is that sort of an upside or is that contemplated in the share count?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. I'll ask Sam to comment on the share repurchase point. On the GRAIL Series B, we talked before about our timing and GRAIL is expecting to get that done in the first quarter. Sam, do you want to comment on the repurchase?","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. On the share repurchase, we completed $100 million in Q4, as I mentioned, and currently have $100 million left on our authorization and we'll evaluate it going forward.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. I think, Ross, on the share repurchase, I wouldn't tie it necessarily to the GRAIL close. I mean, we have the authorization and we'll decide what to do with the authorization at the appropriate time more so than tie it to GRAIL.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks. Thanks, everyone.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","One of the point, don't forget that any gain on the GRAIL has a tax impact on it too, so make sure you take that into account.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Amanda Murphy of William Blair.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. So, I have two on NovaSeq as well. I guess, just sort of following after Derik's question on two-color chemistry. So appreciating that it's early, but taking a step back and looking at the NovaSeq. So, obviously, it's a new architecture, you've laid out a long-term roadmap and also it's introducing meaningful improvements in both performance and cost per base over time. And thinking about prior launches that you've had, so obviously the genome analyzer to HiSeq was quite a meaningful replacement back a few years ago. So I'm just trying to think through, given the improvements this platform is introducing, obviously, at different customers, you mentioned clinical and different applications that are looking at. But why wouldn't we see that type of replacement? Again, appreciating it's early, but just trying to appreciate the puts and takes of this launch vis-\u00e0-vis prior launches that you've had?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. Amanda, I think you've made a really good observation, which is, if we try to look for a good analogy here to provide you guys, I think you picked a better analogy. This is not like, for example, the launch of the X or the NextSeq because those were incremental to our portfolio and were opening up a new customer base. And so, NovaSeq is not quite like that and we've been asked that question a lot, and I think the better analogy is the one you baked, which is the GA moving to the HiSeq. Now, it's not a perfect analogy, but it's good in the sense that we are talking about the biggest part of our customer base that is going to be upgrading.","And so, to that point, I think, over time, we do expect that those 800 HiSeq customers over time will move to NovaSeq, maybe a small percentage will move to NextSeq. But, over time, the entire HiSeq customer base will turn over. And in that sense, it is similar to what happened with the GA.","Now, the impact was bigger when it was \u2013 in terms of percentage of our customers, it was bigger when it was GA to HiSeq because that was our only instrument and we upgraded our entire customer base. Here we are doing the biggest part of our customers base, but it's not our entire customer base. But we do expect this big part of our customer base over time and we will kick that wave off this year and it'll play out in the coming years, but that is exactly the intent.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, just another one on comments you made about the addressable market, obviously, you talked about new \u2013 or new applications I should say that, maybe enabled here and I know, again, it's very early, so I appreciate that. But any sense of at least early conversations with customers, even the 49 orders that you've referred, I guess, indications you've received already, how they are thinking about using the NovaSeq even for new projects or anything incremental they are looking at in terms of funding? It's just something we get asked a lot about in terms of \u2013 is this going to fund or drive new incremental demand versus more of a competitive type dynamic?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. Absolutely. So, let me give you some color. And we had an advantage because we were already talking to our customers, obviously, before we launched NovaSeq. And one of the thing we heard very loud and clear was a lot of our HiSeq customers wanted the power of the X, but they couldn't in some cases (39:26) $6 million or the $10 million. And so, we had the benefit of years of feedback from HiSeq customers saying, they want that power. If they have that power, they could do this and that and the other.","And then we also heard from them that they wanted the power of the X and they wanted it across multiple applications. And so, when we talked about the scenarios that the NovaSeq was going to address, it was with the benefit of already having had that feedback for a couple of years. And so, not surprisingly, the conversations we've had since validated those points. Every one of the examples I gave at JPMorgan, we had real customers say that's exactly what they want to do.","So, if it's moving from exomes to genomes, there is a whole set of customers that want to do that. Other customers have talked to us about doing much deeper sequencing for tumor\/normal or ctDNA applications, those were examples I gave at JPMorgan, there are real customers that want to use the NovaSeq to do that.","The single-cell example that I talked about, again, they're real customers that want to do that. And so those all we believe will be fundamentally enabled by NovaSeq and those will open up. So, this will be much more than just an upgrade cycle, and this has been true at every big platform that we brought out over the years. This will enable fundamentally new applications like those to play out in the coming years.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And then our next question comes from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Francis, I want to go back to a topic you talked about, I think it was in response to one of the first question, sort of talking about how some of the Xs may not convert to NovaSeq. You mentioned that some of the 3000s and 4000s at least it sounded like may still be installed. So, I guess, question is, are you carrying a backlog for the 3000s and 4000s?","And then secondly, can you just give us an update around the timing of releasing protocols for different sequencing methods on NovaSeq? And then lastly, if I could just squeak one in around, your thoughts on the new administration's tax and import plans? Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yes. So, let me get through the first set of questions. We are carrying a very small backlog on the HiSeqs, and so the backlog we're carrying primarily are the Xs and we talked about we have 37 Xs in the backlog coming into this quarter. We do expect the majority of them to go to NovaSeq, but there are specific cases of customers that are running big projects. And in some cases, the projects will continue for the better part of this year. And so, if you're already in the midst of a project and you need additional capacity, it makes sense for you to buy another X. And so, we expect some of the customers to continue to buy Xs to service those existing projects.","And then, there are other customers who will be talking to us that need to run sample cohorts now. And as they look at the math, the benefit on NovaSeq for X customers really comes in when you get to the S4. And that's not till the sort of tail-end of this year. And so there are scenarios where it actually make sense for you to go out and buy an X now if you have a large cohort that you want to process now. And so we expect to see that dynamic play out too, but the majority of customers will go to NovaSeq.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And Bill, that explanation is aligned with the commentary that Sam had in the script that we would ship approximately 10 HiSeq and HiSeq X instruments combined in the first quarter.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","And then to the second part of your question around the new administration. Obviously, it's still early days, but to the extent that we see tax reform and we see a lower corporate tax rate, that would be beneficial. We have currently setup a tolling infrastructure, so we have to look at how that plays out with a new tax regime, but that could be incrementally beneficial to us.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","I think there is one more in there we may have missed.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah, sorry. The last piece there, which is Francis if you could just touch on the timing of releasing protocols for different sequencing methods on NovaSeq? Thank you.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","I believe there is some data in BaseSpace already. I'll follow-up with the timing on the rest of the protocol, Bill. I don't have it off the top of my head.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thanks, Rebecca. Thanks, Francis.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And then our next question comes from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, good afternoon, guys. Thank you. I wanted to maybe ask a bigger picture question away from the technology and the NovaSeq product cycle. There has been a lot of change in the company on leadership side over the last six, 12 months and you guys have made some interesting steps I think to streamline the portfolio, you mentioned the NeoPrep end-of-life and I think you got out of other \u2013 couple other very small product areas.","So, it's a more focused company, it's new leadership team, and I was interested in how you guys think about where you want to take the company from a product standpoint over the next three, five years? You've obviously put out NovaSeq, but should we assume that this is sort of the beginning of a wave of refreshes across the core product line and that's the core focus? Or is this sort of just a point in time and there is a bunch of other things away from sequencing equipment where we can expect the innovation curve to continue to pick up?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Sure. I'll start by saying that, look, at our core \u2013 and this has been true since the founding of the company. We are an innovation-driven company and we spend a lot of our time thinking about the fundamental breakthroughs that will accelerate the adoption of genomics and accelerate, as in our mission to improve human health through unlocking the power of the genome. And so, we're going to continue to do that. We continue to invest a lot in R&D. And we believe there is a lot of headroom that we can invest in either to provide better, faster, cheaper sequencing and get us to that $100 genome or to provide more sample-to-answer solutions that would be enabling in applied markets and in the clinical markets. And so, the focus on great products, the focus on innovation, that's going to continue to be true for indefinitely.","We have done \u2013 we've used the opportunity over the last year with the change in leadership to look critically at the whole portfolio and see where there was an opportunity to focus. And we found the set of opportunities, we found SKUs that were on the market that had a place in the portfolio that made sense at a given time, but weren't the best use of our investment dollars. And so, we've end-of-life'd some SKUs, we shut down some projects, and we put more wood behind the really game-changing projects that we're working on.","We've also built that into our strategic planning process. So, we have in my mind one of the best strategic planning processes I've ever seen around identifying emerging areas in the market and identifying disruptive technologies that would enable those areas in the market. What we've added in the last year is also a focus on \u2013 and what do we not do to enable us to accelerate those big areas. And so, that focus has now been incorporated into our strategic planning process.","As you think about the future, you will continue to see us innovate to enable more research in genomics across many, many areas, as we've done in the past. But in the future, you will see us being much more clinically focused, much more globally focused, and much more digital than we've ever been before. And so, you can start to see that play out. You'll see more focus on not just products that target the clinical markets, but also the other elements that enable the clinical market. So, we created a Market Access Group in the last year to work with payers and national systems to provide them with the clinical utility data, the economic analysis data to accelerate decisions around the adoption of genomics-based testing. You'll see those kinds of activities. You've seen us put regulatory feet on the ground in more geographies to work with the local markets to make sure that we have the right regulatory frameworks in place for the key markets that we're going after. And so, those are some of the ways you can expect to see us evolve in the coming years.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then just maybe one follow-up on the numbers. You guys had done a big Analyst Meeting in 2014. You gave a long-term guidance range. And as we move into sort of the 2017 and beyond timeframe, there isn't any long-term guidance currently to hang your head on, hence a lot of questions around near-term numbers. Can you give us a sense of what it would take for you to get comfortable and get to a point where you'd want to go out and give another long-term guidance outlook? Is it a function of installing your team more fully? Is it more about continued portfolio review? Just curious about some of the gating factors that you need to clear in order to give investors an updated long-term view. Thank you.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","I think you have a right to and I think you can expect to see from us some time in the coming year to spend the time and either put on \u2013 and we'll think about the forum, whether it's an Analyst Day or something like that, but we do owe you long-term guidance and a way to think about this market. And so, that doesn't mean there is any specific thing gating us, I think we just have to get it on the calendar and sort of get it out there. So, that's something...","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","So, one IR caveat to that, and that is that, that will be a very typical Analyst and\/or Investor Day when it happens. It won't be a forum that we use to launch products like we have in the past. So, just to set the expectation now that it will be a broader company update, not necessarily tied to product launches.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Thank you, Isaac.","Operator","And our next question is from Dan Leonard of Deutsche Bank.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. How are you thinking about samples availability as you roll out or when you roll out the S4 ChIP? (49:42) Are there things you can do to help your customers get more samples, so that they could utilize the 20% economics on that?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, the customers that we are talking to, a lot of them actually have access to samples already or they have line of sight into where they could get the samples. Some of them, it's because they're connected to healthcare systems; some of them, just because they've been doing this for a while, they have a very large number of samples banked that they have access to. The other thing that we are doing is, by pre-signaling where the price of a genome could go, we are as I said igniting the imagination of all these researchers who are thinking about the kinds of projects that they will be able to do.","And so, what that does and have done for us historically is that creates sort of the demand that we then launch a product into. So, the X gave everybody preview of the power that they could expect to be available to the masses. And so, for the last few years, that power is only available to 35 customers around the globe. But the other 800 customers that had HiSeqs knew that we had that power, and so for the last couple of years, they've been doing the work to think about what could they do and then they lobbied us on, give us that power. And so, a lot of them have already got line of sight into what they would do and where they would get those sample.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Operator, we can hear you.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful, Francis. And if you don't mind a follow-up. I think a number of investors could help with the reconciliation of the $1 billion-plus GRAIL fundraising with the less than 1% expectation in revenue for 2017 between GRAIL and Helix. Any color you could offer on that?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, if GRAIL buys \u2013 if GRAIL bought instruments such as they did, and if they buy in Q1 and they are still a consolidated entity, we don't get to recognize revenue on the instruments we give them. So, through the end of Q1, they could have purchased instruments and we don't get to recognize revenue on those instruments. And so, if you think about it, what we will be recognizing as revenue are instruments they buy Q2 to Q4. They've already bought instruments, so you shouldn't be expecting them to buy a big bolus of instruments between Q2 and Q4. And so, I think that's one big driver. Also, if they've already embarked on any kind of study, they'd want to close out that study before they swapped instruments. Over time, we fully expect them to become a very large customer of ours and likely on a large number of NovaSeqs. So, that's going to be over time and not this year.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","And Dan, it's 1% from GRAIL and 1% from Helix.","Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thanks.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","Or less than 1% each.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve from Morgan Stanley.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. It's Steve Beuchaw here from Morgan Stanley. A quick question following-up on the commentary on the backlog of HiSeqs. It's helpful to think about the backlog of HiSeqs to think about the potential impact that we see on instrument revenue. I wonder if you could give some similar color with regard to consumables just to think about the potential impact on consumables revenue this year. If you thought about how much revenue or the value in revenue terms of consumables associated with high throughput instruments that's out there in the field. Could you give us a rough idea of how big that is?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Well, I think the best way to get off of that Steve is, you've got the ranges that existed through 2016 and you've got the installed base, and from that you can derive the high throughput consumable pull-through that we're getting on an annual basis. I think as you think into 2017 about that, we've got the temporal effect, whether it's Q1 and Q2 or not of the four factors that Sam outlined that will drive customers to spend less initially on sequencing consumables because of NovaSeq. So, I think you're going to see some temporal shifts there. And then over time, what we should see, thanks to elasticity, is that at least the sequencing consumables that you lose on the high throughput instruments to get replaced is replaced on NovaSeq. And because we are creating more capacity, we're creating more potential for even incremental spend if customers can get hold of the money. So, that creates a multi-year upside opportunity, given the higher capacity we're putting out there. Does that answer your question?","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I want to put some numbers to it later on, but before we get there, just as my follow-up, would it be reasonable to think about a consumables re-acceleration exiting 2017 as we see some restocking? Thanks.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Well, you might \u2013 it depends. I mean, it depends on a lot of factors. And have you saw a restocking effect, then you wouldn't necessarily want to extrapolate a restocking. But really the best way to think about consumables, I like to think about it as, it's really driven first and foremost by samples. And so, if you believe that more samples will get sequenced sequentially quarter after quarter, time over time, then ultimately it translates to consumables whether you get a lumpiness due to a stocking buy or a customer buying every six months instead of every quarter, you'll see those effects. But over time, it's just correlated to the number of samples that get sequenced and the price per sample that we put out there, and the elasticity that we're creating with new instruments.","Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.","As well as the function of the installed base growth in the prior year.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for all the help there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to start and ask about the oncology growth, but as you get more experience in clinical setting, just I'm curious what surprised you about the market? Have you seen more demand for reagent rental and just sort of the consolidation of customers and really pushing into community hospitals?","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","Yeah. So, in terms of oncology growth and we talked about the strong growth we are seeing and we saw that across the whole year, the growth is driven primarily today still in the translational side of that market. And so, it is the large academic cancer centers, but it's also some commercial organizations that are driving a lot of the growth that we are seeing.","In terms of what surprised us, one of the thing, I think, that has been a surprise has been just how much innovation there is happening. I mean, the whole area of immunotherapy, for example, over the last couple of years has been not only transformational in oncology, but has started to show up in terms of the impact that will have in the clinics and the demand for our offerings over time in that segment of the market.","We weren't expecting to see quite the proliferation of panels is another thing that surprised us, that's played out over the last couple of years. And that's also driven by the innovation we're seeing at our customers sites, where the leading academic cancer centers have created probably over a thousand panels out in the market, and that's really great in terms of the innovation moving the whole space forward. And now, we're at the time where we are starting to see a need for consolidation, especially as you talked about, as we think about the next tier of hospitals or the community hospitals.","And so, we're now at the stage where we're seeing it crossover into being something that the community hospitals want access to. And to enable that access, they've been asking for more standardized panel that is more prescriptive around what genes to look at. They have been asking for a more standardized reporting capability and analysis capability. And so, that's driven a lot of the work that we've done around TST 170, that's also driven the partnerships that we put together with IBM Watson, with Philips. And so, we think the market is now at the stage where we're starting to see pull from the next tier of hospitals and community hospitals, but they want more of the pieces sort of prepackaged for them.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Very thorough. Just one more on GRAIL. What are updates we should be expecting in 2017, whether it's research published, traction toward a clinical trial, just prep for that, what should we be watching for in terms of update? Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc.","What they've talked about is the circulating cell-free tumor DNA atlas that they are putting together. And they talked about the fact that you should start to see output from them towards the back half of the year. And so, I think that's a big step for the team, obviously, the close of Series B is something that you'll see from them in the coming weeks. Those are probably things they have publicly put out in terms of what you can expect to see from them.","Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc.","And bear in mind you, you wouldn't be getting updates from us on GRAIL on for Series B closes, just like you don't on any other of our customers.","Operator","Thank you.

Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Rebecca, and good afternoon, everyone. As we shared a few weeks ago, fourth quarter results surpassed our expectations with revenue of $592 million, an increase of 15% over the prior-year period and our 17th consecutive quarter of sequential growth.","During the quarter, we witnessed robust trends across the business, including year-over-year total sequencing growth of 19%, and 30% shipment growth to clinical and translational customers.","Demand from clinical oncology customers contributed to the strong Q4 result with approximately 40% growth compared to the prior-year quarter. We're very pleased with the commercial uptake of the TST 15 product, and the TST 170 development program remains on track. These panels are based on initial standards defined by the Actionable Genome Consortium and were developed to drive adoption of NGS in the translational market and by pharma partners in their clinical trials. Encouragingly, we recently announced that Amgen will be utilizing the IUO version of TST 15 as part of a new oncology development program, and we're in discussions with other potential pharma partners as well.","In early January, we formed GRAIL, a new company focused on the cancer screening market. We're currently working to transfer our ctDNA programs, the MSK partnership, and the employees working on these projects to GRAIL. We're in the late stages of recruiting a CEO and have identified a potential lab and office space in the Bay Area. We've begun work on the detailed planning necessary to embark on a large-scale clinical trial in 2017 with the goal of demonstrating a stage shift in diagnosis.","In our reproductive and genetic health business, we saw strong adoption of both our IVS and NIPT products in the fourth quarter. Sales of our pre-implantation genetic screening or PGS products increased close to 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Further, we completed enrollment in the STAR trial ahead of schedule, which will measure the impact of PGS in embryo morphology on IVF success rates.","NIPT revenue grew more than 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Test send-out volumes were slightly lower sequentially at 45,000 as one of our large customers began to shift testing in-house. This transition will decrease service revenue and increase product sales in the coming quarters. Partially offsetting this impact will be continued penetration of the average risk opportunity. Currently, we estimate more than 70 million lives or 25% of the U.S. population has coverage with Anthem and regional Blue Cross, Blue Shield carriers who've made a favorable coverage decision for average risk.","Moving to arrays, shipments grew 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year and revenue was down 2%, with ASPs sequentially stable for the second quarter in a row. With strong demand from agriculture, DTC, and biobanking customers as well as the launch of our new arrays, Methyl EPIC and ImmunoArray, we shipped 1.6 million samples during Q4, a new record. We project slight array growth in 2016 supported by the entering backlog and the availability of Infinium XT later this year.","In summary, the momentum in the fourth quarter was largely driven by the continued penetration of clinical genomics in the oncology and reproductive health markets. This trend together with our strategic investments in market and platform development will enable us to deliver on our mission to unlock the power of the genome and further penetrate the many large and untapped opportunities ahead of us.","Lastly, as you may have read in our 8-K yesterday, Dr. William Rastetter stepped off the Illumina board in order to invest and serve as a board member of GRAIL. I would like to thank Bill for his enormous contributions during his 17 years as a board member and 11 years as chairman.","I'll now turn the call over to Francis who will provide a detailed overview of our product results.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Thanks, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to provide further details on the performance of our products in the fourth quarter.","To begin, interest in the HiSeq high throughput portfolio remained strong with HiSeq 2500 and HiSeq 4000 orders both exceeding our expectations. Versus the prior year, shipments were lower due to challenging comparisons in HiSeq X and HiSeq 2500. Demand for HiSeq X was generated from customers adding capacity, as well as new X sites which totaled 27 at the end of the fourth quarter. While orders are expected to be relatively steady in the 20- to 30-per-quarter range, shipments depend on customer readiness, which we expect will result in fewer than 20 shipments in Q1.","Demand for HiSeq 2500 exceeded expectations in Q4 due to commercial customers with validated workflows who value the rapid run mode this product offers. During the quarter, we received a multi-unit order from an NIPT customer as well as orders from commercial customers looking to add throughput to their laboratories.","HiSeq 4000 also benefited from capacity additions including multiple unit orders from HiSeq X customers looking to expand the application breadth of their respective fleets. HiSeq 4000 again was the leading platform sold, which lifted ASPs for the family of instruments compared to the prior year.","Moving to our benchtop instruments, we saw a rebound in demand in the fourth quarter as MiSeq orders approached record levels and NextSeq orders were the highest in any quarter since launch. These order trends were the result of delivering on the strong pipeline we saw exiting Q3.","Heading into 2016, our MiSeq and NextSeq pipelines remain stable, but at a more normalized level than seen entering the fourth quarter. Clinical and translational centers drove demand for NextSeq instruments, accounting for more than 40% of orders. Continued interest came from our NIPT partners in China, reproductive health customers focused on PGS and NIPT, and oncology customers.","New-to-sequencing customers accounted for approximately 55% of MiSeq orders in the fourth quarter with our new-to-NGS bundle contributing to this dynamic. MiSeqDx orders were also at record levels in the quarter and we recently submitted our registration document for IVD designation on MiSeq in Korea. We're continuing to work closely with the FDA to update the intended use of the MiSeqDx to include a claim for DNA, isolated for multiple sample types. Both of these activities will further support the global demand for MiSeqDx units.","Moving now to our newest benchtop instruments, I'd like to share some customer feedback on MiniSeq. Approximately 4,600 attendees have signed up for our webinars to learn more about MiniSeq, our largest-ever registration for a new product. Early customer feedback indicates only a slight overlap with MiSeq, and as a result we expect minimal cannibalization in the range of 20% to 25%. In addition, we believe many of the customers who choose MiniSeq over MiSeq will opt for multiple units to optimize the throughput and sample flexibility of their fleets. With these early indicators of demand, we're pleased with how the pipeline for MiniSeq is building and expect its customer friendly features to further democratize sequencing.","In Informatics, we continue to increase the level of integration with BaseSpace. We have completed the planning and design of the Clarity LIMS-BaseSpace integration, which we intend to release towards the end of Q1. We believe this will enable better visibility on lab metrics and shorten turnaround time for our customers. BaseSpace now includes more than 70 apps as well as an upgraded dashboard and analysis manager to improve monitoring and control of reports. These enhancements combined with the introduction of the BaseSpace Professional and Enterprise editions will enable researchers to enrich their informatics experience, while improving efficiency in sequencing labs.","I'll now turn the call over to Marc, who will provide a detailed overview of our fourth quarter results.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Francis. As we shared a few weeks ago, Q4 closed out a solid year for Illumina. Revenue for the year grew 19% versus the prior year to $2.22 billion, which equates to 23% on a constant currency basis.","Fourth quarter revenue was slightly better than our preannouncement at $592 million, 15% growth versus the prior-year period and 19% constant currency-adjusted. This strong quarterly result can be attributed to better-than-forecasted demand for benchtop instruments as well as strength in sequencing consumables and services.","Shipments in the Americas grew 25% year-over-year in Q4, while European and APAC shipments increased 5% and 10% respectively over the same period. Growth in our international regions was slightly muted due to the impact of currency. Further, Europe faced a challenging HiSeq X comparison while the Asia Pacific region continue to experience weakness in the Japanese funding environment.","Consumable revenue was $346 million, an increase of 19% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as higher demand for sequencing consumables, including record library prep shipment was partially offset by a slight decline in arrays. Consumable revenue represented 59% of total revenue, up from 57% in the prior-year period and the 58% we saw in Q3.","As we've previously shared, sequencing consumable revenue was robust, growing to approximately $280 million, up close to 30% over the prior year. This result was driven by our growing installed base of instruments and strength in NextSeq consumables, which saw utilization well above our updated guidance range of $100K to $125K per instrument annually. This is the first quarter that NextSeq has exceeded our range, so we are not updating our utilization guidance at this time.","MiSeq utilization was in our projected range of $40K to $45K, and HiSeq pull-through per instrument excluding HiSeq X was in our projected range of $300K to $350K. HiSeq X utilization fell short of our recently increased pull-through guidance range due to order timing. We continue to project HiSeq X utilization of $650K to $700K per instrument over the course of 2016. However, the timing of a single order of $4 million or more would be sufficient to move pull-through outside of our projected range in any quarter, given the size of our installed base.","Services and other revenue, which includes genotyping and sequencing services as well as instrument maintenance contracts, grew approximately 50% versus Q4 2014 to $94 million. This improvement was driven by growth in NIPT services, which benefited from increased test send-out revenue and IP fees, extended maintenance contracts associated with the largest sequencing installed base, and genotyping services.","Turning now to gross margin operating expenses, I will highlight our adjusted non-GAAP results, which exclude non-cash stock compensation expense and other items. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures included in today's earnings release. Result from projections includes Helix and projections now also include our GRAIL business. Accordingly, all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refer to the results attributable to Illumina's stockholders after non-controlling interests.","Our adjusted gross margin for the fourth quarter was 71.7%, a decline compared to 73.2% in the third quarter, primarily due to the lower mix of sequencing consumables and a higher mix of arrays and services. Year-over-year, adjusted gross margins contracted 60 basis points due to a higher mix of services revenue.","Adjusted research and development expenses for the quarter were $103 million or 17.5% of revenue, higher compared to $90 million or 16.4% of revenue in the third quarter due to the impact of additional head count and spending associated with the launch of MiniSeq, Project Firefly, and clinical trials.","Adjusted SG&A expenses for the quarter were $124 million or 20.9% of revenue, an increase compared to $115 million or 20.9% (sic) [18.9%] of revenue in the previous quarter due to the impact of additional head count.","Adjusted operating margins were 33.4% compared to 36% in the third quarter and 37.7% in the prior-year period, due to the impact of lower gross margin, higher head count, and previously mentioned investments.","In the fourth quarter, our stock-based compensation expense equaled $35 million, better than projected due primarily to cancellations associated with the management changes that we announced in December.","Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.5% compared to 16.2% in the fourth quarter of last year, higher than expected due to a one-time international restructuring charge. As a reminder, Q4 2014 was impacted by favorable adjustments related to multiple prior-year provisions and higher-than-expected stock deductions.","Non-GAAP net income was $121 million for Q4, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.81. This compares to non-GAAP net income and EPS of $129 million and $0.87 respectively in the fourth quarter of 2014. Included in the Q4 2015 non-GAAP EPS result is approximately a $0.01 of dilution from Helix. In addition the impact of foreign exchange lowered Q4 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.05 relative to last year.","We reported GAAP net income of $104 million or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, compared to net income of $153 million or $1.03 per diluted share in the prior-year period, which reflected a gain associated with the settlement of the Syntrix litigation, partially offset by legal contingency costs related to the Sequenom patent pool agreement.","Cash flow from operations equaled $240 million in the fourth quarter. Q4 DSO decreased to 64 days compared to 68 days last quarter due primarily to improved shipment linearity. Inventory increased to $271 million, largely due to a build-up of sequencing instruments and safety stock. Capital expenditures in Q4 were $35 million, resulting in $205 million of free cash flow. For the fiscal year, cash flow from operations equaled $660 million and capital expenditures were $143 million, resulting in $517 million of free cash flow.","During the quarter, $29 million of the 2016 0.25% convertible bonds were settled, leaving approximately $75 million remaining, which will come due in the first quarter. We repurchased over 1.3 million shares at an average price of $151.44 utilizing $202 million under our previously announced buyback program, leaving us with more than $255 million of authorization remaining under this program. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.39 billion in cash and short-term investments.","Moving now to guidance, as we shared a few weeks ago, we expect total company revenue growth of 16% in 2016 or 17% on a constant currency basis based on today's rates. Underlying this guidance is an assumption of sequencing consumables will generate the vast majority of growth while sequencing instruments are expected to be relatively flat versus the prior year given a strong HiSeq X backlog shipments in Q1 2015, resulting in a challenging comparison. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $3.55 to $3.65, including the impact of $0.15 and $0.10 of dilution from GRAIL and Helix respectively. Additionally, we project approximately 73% gross margin, a full year pro forma tax rate at 26%, and full year weighted average non-GAAP diluted shares outstanding of 149 million. We expect the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of approximately $30 million.","Specific to the first quarter, we are projecting flat to slightly higher revenue sequentially as a result of the stronger-than-anticipated Q4 result. Additionally, operating expenses are projected to increase by approximately $20 million sequentially based on the ramping of investment in Helix and GRAIL as well as the head count additions from strong hiring momentum coming out of 2015.","We are off to a good start in 2016 and believe that the important investments we are making in the business, including Helix and GRAIL, will catalyze significant long-term revenue growth for the company as we continue to drive the broad adoption of genomics.","Thank you for your time. We will now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we'll now open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks. I guess, question on the instrument guidance for flat placements, I'm wondering if you can provide a little bit more color. It sounds like you mentioned more normalized MiSeq and NextSeq orders, so maybe start with expectations there. And then with HiSeq 3000, HiSeq 4000, if you could just talk to how you are thinking about the upgrade cycle given the strength you're still seeing with HiSeq 2500, that would be helpful.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let's say first, Tycho, that we're entering 2016 with a pretty normalized backlog in terms of all the instruments in the product line. When we entered 2015, we still had a very large backlog of HiSeq Xs, which we shipped largely out in the first quarter. So that was a pretty significant impact overall on the instrument number for the year, was the makeup of that backlog. So, we don't have that situation coming into 2016. MiniSeq, of course, is going to be a positive lift for the instrument line during the course of the year, partially offset by some cannibalization across the MiSeq part of the product line. But it's really overcoming that extra shipment we had in Q1 on a comparable basis from the HiSeq Xs that caused us to give guidance to relatively flat instruments for the year.","With respect to the upgrade cycle, we think it's continuing from \u2013 so, HiSeq 3000s and HiSeq 4000s from the HiSeq 2500. But we've been actually pleasantly surprised, I would say, by the fact that we continue to get more orders for HiSeq 2500s than we expected, and that's largely because of clinical customers that have the instrument validated in their workflows and from those customers liking the rapid run mode, which we don't currently have implemented in the HiSeq 3000s and HiSeq 4000s.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could ask one follow-up, can you just discuss any feedback you've had from your existing pancancer panel customers with regards to GRAIL?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't have any pancancer screening customers. So, GRAIL occupies an absolute unique niche in the market with a pancancer assay target for screening. And it's strongly our belief that no customer that we have or anyone else has in the sequencing market has the ability to implement a screening test for asymptomatic individuals across all cancer types or most cancer types anytime in the next five years because of the economics required to sequence as deeply as we think will be necessary to make that test as specific and sensitive as required. So we've not seen any negative reaction from any existing customers.","Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you and good afternoon. The Q4 service revenue was quite robust. How material a driver to services growth was average risk NIPT reimbursement and also population genomics programs? And what does your guidance embed for services revenue growth for the year, given it seems like the two things I mentioned would seem to be trends that would continue, but you do have an offset where one of your major NIPT customers did bring NIPT in house rather than sending out volumes to you?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I don't actually have the statistics, Doug, of what the average risk dollar contribution was to the NIPT component in the services line. We did mention in the script that the actual number of samples we did in the quarter went down a bit. And that's because of a large customer of ours who has been in the process of moving the technology in-house, and that will continue through the course of the year. Population genomics really is one account now, largely Genome England. And if anything, that's running somewhat behind our expectations in terms of sample volume. We expected to start ramping significantly in 2016, but in 2015 it's probably gone a little bit slower than we might have expected. As we look at services revenues for 2016, there are going some offsetting factors. We have some consumer business there that will continue to be very robust. We expect through 2016 average risk will help to some extent, but that would be offset by one of our largest NIPT customers moving the test in-house. We will have GeL accelerating there as well. So there is some pluses and minus, puts and takes in the services line.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. But in the quarter, then, recognizing those puts and takes, and also recognizing that you had a \u2013 still a pretty big sequential step up, is there something you could call out as being the material driver to that?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, because the installed base continues to grow, our overall warranty service contract business is growing very, very nicely, our maintenance contracts. And then, I would say the other big plus is how well we're doing in the consumer business and services.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I guess just given all the moving parts at the R&D line, I was hoping that you might be willing to provide some breakdown, at least on this call, of R&D expense allocation, maybe something along the lines of how much you're allocating to sequencing platform development, really, technology development, how much is bioinformatics, maybe sample prep, and maybe something on the clinical study or consumer market, however you want to break it out. Would you be willing to give us a little bit of detail there and how that's evolved and how you expect it to evolve in the years ahead?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say not a dramatic change, although probably in 2016, we're working a bit more on the platform side because of the launch of MiniSeq and getting that all wrapped up, and also the significant investments that we're putting in place for Firefly. So we're probably slightly more biased toward platforms than we have been historically. We've never given an exact breakdown of how we spend R&D, and I don't think we're prepared to do that today. But that tweaking on the margin probably is a little bit more toward platforms.","Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is actually Mike Ruskin (25:37) calling for Derik. I had a quick question about the cancer moonshot that President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden announced. If you could comment on how much of an impact you're expecting to see from that especially with the recent news the other day that they're planning to spend another $195 million on cancer research at the NIH this year.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and it's certainly going to be a plus. We're excited about the program and the fact it actually has some funding behind it. It's a little early to know specifically how much of that activity is going to be allocated towards sequencing, but they've called out specifically the work to identify the molecular basis of tumors. Clearly, the kinds of things that we're doing in early detection are going to be very important. So I would say, qualitatively, we expect there to be a nice tailwind for our business from that, but it's too early to quantitate it.","Unknown Speaker","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Afternoon. Thanks guys. Francis, can you expand on the MiSeq-MiniSeq dynamic just in terms of the selling strategy or the criteria that you're using to determine whether MiniSeq is the right box or whether maybe an upsell to the MiSeq is more appropriate. And then if I could sneak in a follow-up, Marc, just curious how the margin profile for the MiniSeq will compare to the rest of the instrument portfolio once it's scaled up. Thanks.","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Sure. The MiniSeq really targets sort of the long tail \u2013 the very long tail, we believe, of labs, the majority of which are new to sequencing. And so these are labs where, either because of capital constraints or frankly they just don't have the volume of samples to justify buying a MiSeq, and so for them, the MiniSeq is the perfect instrument. And in some cases, if they have even more budget, they're more likely to get two MiniSeqs, because of the flexibly that gives them in terms of managing samples and workflows.","If you have a larger volume of samples, then you tend to go to the MiSeq today. And so what we're seeing is either a lab that have more samples or clinical labs that value the Dx designation off the MiSeq platform. And so that's sort of how it's breaking out. We had a thesis that the MiniSeq was going to open up a new segment for us and would not be largely cannibalistic. And based on the early feedback we're getting from the interest in the MiniSeq, that thesis seems to be true. And so we believe there will be minimal cannibalization between those two instruments to the order of 20% to 25%.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And remember, MiSeq has some unique features that MiniSeq doesn't. It's got the Dx version; of course, we have the long reads, 2x400s, 2x350s on MiSeq, which we don't have on the MiniSeq. And of course, if you're doing something like deep cancer panels, you need more throughput. And that would tend to bias toward MiSeq, where MiniSeq will be much more targeted.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And Dan, on the gross margin question, I would say, the margin for MiniSeq is pretty typical of our benchtop instruments, and I would compare it more to MiSeq than anything else. And in fact, as it's typical with any time we launch a new instrument, the initial warranty and installation experience, we tend to estimate to be on the high side, and certainly, in the first couple of months or maybe in six months, it is. And then that settles down over time as well.","Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with UBS. Your line is now open.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Jay, can you maybe talk a little bit about the decision to keep a majority ownership stake in GRAIL and also in the variable interest of Helix? And then also I'd love just kind of any update on Helix. You mentioned the growth in your \u2013 on your large consumer customers who \u2013 I think talked about pretty spectacular growth in the last quarter there, but also maybe a little bit of reticence to move to Helix or to sequencing.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. You can imagine on both Helix and GRAIL, we had significant internal debate about what the right structure for these entities should be. At the end of the day, the key considerations came down to the nature of the business itself. And in the case of (30:22-30:27) than Illumina's core business, one being very focused on a new market, that being the consumer; and the second, being a business that will very likely be a global services company. And neither of those are directly what Illumina does. So that was quite important.","We thought both of these needed to operate in sort of the high-velocity startup mode, and we wanted to have the ability to recruit the best possible talent early on into these companies. And so we thought the best structure for that was to spin them out of the core of Illumina, have a separate management team, separate board, but retain majority ownership. So that Illumina, as these companies, be as successful as we hope, we'll get the majority of the benefit from these.","With respect to Helix, JPMorgan announced the second set of partners, so a total of four are now announced. The two largest consumer companies so far have not been announced as joining Helix. It's certainly our ambitions to try to get them to join, but you can imagine as an incumbent in this space, there might be some initial reluctance to do that. So it's imperative for us to really build this ecosystem out and to demonstrate that we have the capability to deliver a better experience and better economics to the incumbents than what they do independent of Helix. We're working on a large number of other potential partnerships within Helix as well, and we're very active in recruiting a CEO and hope to get that done here in the next month or two.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","I don't know if I can have a quick follow-up there, but is your sense that there's a desire for sequence data, or on the consumer side is \u2013 are you learning that maybe that's just not so important to them right now? There's some other factors, I guess?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I don't think that's the key determinant, Jon. I think everyone wants to move toward sequencing. I think it's a question of really economics and to what extent Helix can subsidize the upfront economics to allow the consumer price points that exist today and the margins that are being delivered in the existing consumer companies. But the whole idea of having the full content database and being able to go back to that content without having to rerun or recreate a chip, I think, is appealing to everyone. So there's no resistance on that front.","Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Good afternoon, guys. So, just quickly on the Q1 guide, I mean, aside from, obviously, the downtick on the HiSeq Xs seemed temporal, I guess as we just think about sort of the sequential movement, obviously we'll get a little bit less box placement, in least a few of the pieces is just that seasonal, but were also the other key deltas \u2013 I'm just taking back the historical step-ups off of Q4. And they're, I don't know, 5%, 6%, and this is obviously a bit less. So I'm just trying to see how much \u2013 what other sort of flex points there are on that sequential movement.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Ross, let me mention two things. Marc may have some more to throw into this after I start the answer here. I'd say one thing is that we had a very strong Q4, that we actually outperformed all of our forecasts in Q4, and so that's caused us to temper our expectations a little bit for the percentage growth into Q1. I'd say the second factor is that we're a little bit cautious whenever we announce a new instrument like MiniSeq, that sometimes customers take a little bit of time to make a decision. So there is a chance that we may slow down at some orders in Q1 because customers are deciding between MiSeqs and MiniSeqs. And that will cause some instruments to get pushed probably out into Q2 that otherwise may have come in, in Q1. Marc, anything else to add?","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. The only thing I would add is if you look at it geographically, Japan has often been a very strong contributor to Q1, both instruments and reagents. And we're not entirely counting on that to be the case this quarter, given the funding challenges that we've seen over there.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Got it. And maybe just following up on MiniSeq, you gave the number in terms of individuals signing up for sort of the webinars. Can you just help us put that in context of what you think the total addressable market opportunity is here? And then secondarily, the staffing needs to ensure that you can sort of execute on that part of the market, which is likely to be slightly different, obviously, than some of your other platforms just in terms of user base and sales, what sort of OpEx needs in terms of what you guided to already are sort of being allocated there?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean I think the OpEx considerations are built into the guidance that we'd provided, so there should be nothing incremental to what we've done in the guidance. So \u2013 and the commercial team clearly has been thinking about this for quite some time. We think it is largely opening up a new market segment. We need to become more efficient to sell systems effectively that are priced at $50,000 and ultimately below with Firefly. And so we're a tremendous amount of work in the commercial organization to sort of tune our organization, hire people that perhaps are earlier in their careers and at lower price points. We're working on our services model, and of course it requires that these instruments be fundamentally more robust to reduce the amount of service and training that's required. So all that commercial work is going on now and is built into the guidance that you've seen.","In terms of the addressable market, I think that the \u2013 if you think about the 50,000 labs out there, there's probably half of them would want to have a MiniSeq if they could, but the funding won't support that. So getting below the $50,000 price point, we think, opens up certainly the opportunity to get to many, many thousands of these instruments placed. We talked about our installed base of the MiSeq at the JPMorgan conference, and I would suspect if we went out a few years on MiniSeq that the installed base would be some multiple of the installed base of MiSeqs.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Great. Very helpful. Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. I just had a quick question on the X platform. So in terms of funding, it seems like while the NIH-derived large-scale funding might be sort of down year-over-year, that perhaps we're seeing some increased funding from other agencies within NIH in terms of large-scale sequencing, and then obviously positive potential trends going forward here in NIH, as well as industry buyers maybe that are a bit different than we've seen in the past in terms of pharma biotech and then even some clinical customers. So I guess I'm just curious, do you agree with that statement? And then secondly, what might drive an acceleration in X placements beyond the 20 to 30 that you talked about? Is that something that's feasible if you think out two to three years from now?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I definitely agree with sort of your analysis of the funding opportunities there for Xs. I would say that we have placed an awful lot of Xs now with 27 customers. And if you recall back a couple of years ago when we first launched this, we had talked about 5 to 10. And so we hit a awful lot of the large customers around the world with this. And so the incremental brand-new customer is naturally \u2013 has to be created from scratch almost because they generally won't be somebody who already exists.","The other thing to be a little bit cautious about is the fact that many of these customers are also going to want to run the full breadth of applications, so they may be opting for HiSeq 4000 rather than HiSeq Xs. So that's another consideration in terms of calculating how many Xs we may place. There's a couple of other things that could happen. Population sequencing projects \u2013 you know we're tracking (39:28) and other places like Australia, which is an interesting opportunity for a POPSEQ project. China's announced that they're going to do some very large population programs, but nobody quite knows the specifics or timing around that, but that could certainly be an upside to Xs as well.","So I think, like so many parts of our business, there're some puts and takes here, and it's caused us to kind of keep the guidance the same at that 20 to 30 per quarter until we know anything different than that.","Amanda L. Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks and good afternoon, everybody. Jay, I just wanted pick up on a comment that you just talked about in terms of China. Certainly, I guess the new five-year budget plan is expected here as soon as March, and there's a lot of talk, certainly at a conference last week, about this being a pretty substantial long-term investment. So I'm just curious kind of what you guys are hearing on China? And then I've got a follow-up. Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And we're hearings big numbers, but none of that is official yet. So it's a kind of leaking out in bits and pieces. We don't know how much of it will be sequencing-directed and what the timing of that might be. Some of these programs, if they begin, spend a year or two collecting samples, and they don't actually start doing any large-scale sequencing for a while. That's certainly the case, for example, in the U.S. PMI program, so there's no sequencing actually budgeted yet in the PMI program.","So we're just going to have to wait and see what the strategy of this is. The alternative could be that they're going to start collecting and start sequencing them just as they come in, which would be very favorable to us. So \u2013 and we're just waiting to hear more specifics in March.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And then on a follow-up, I guess a follow-up to the warranty question earlier. And that is, in terms of kind of that the increase in the warranty expense, obviously your installed base is growing. Is this at all any reflection of kind of the diversification of your customer base? In other words, some of your translational customers may be hanging on to some of the systems longer, and so we could potentially see some more, I guess, sustainable growth within the warranty side. Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","If by warranty expense \u2013 and what I was talking about as warranty revenue or maintenance revenue being a significant (41:52)","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah, warranty and service revenue. Sorry, Jay. I should have clarified that.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I wouldn't say we're seeing necessarily people hold on to systems longer, although there probably is some of that going on. I think we're doing a great job of getting renewal contracts compared to any other business I've seen. The fraction of customers that renew their contracts is very high, and our gross margins are great on these maintenance contracts. So we tend to do pretty well in that business, and we have a team that is totally focused on making sure that customers get their maintenance contracts in place. So I think it's just largely a function of the growth of the installed base more so than it is, at least now, people holding on to systems longer.","William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks a bunch. Question on the guidance this year regarding OpEx, I was sort of thinking through the puts and takes you guys mentioned, and curious if you could talk at all about whether or not there are any internal initiatives to support the scale-up of GRAIL this year, putting aside the ownership structure that we should keep in mind.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","All of the initiatives to build up on GRAIL, Isaac, are going to be in the GRAIL business. So we will have our share of those expenses, and that's in the dilution numbers that we've already talked about. But there's nothing in addition to that other than some minor coordination kind of activities that will be slightly incremental expense to Illumina. But those are kind of in the noise level. Marc, anything else there?","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Just on the geography and how that's accounted for, I mean, we get the full extent of the expenses for both Helix and GRAIL in the R&D and SG&A lines, and you'll see that. And then we get the credit down below the line for that in the non-controlling interest shares. So you'll see it kind of look like a higher uptick for Illumina in the OpEx line, but the benefit is down below.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then maybe a follow-up, I was reviewing the comments that you guys made last month regarding GRAIL timelines, and was curious if you could perhaps talk little bit about some of the key milestones operationally you guys want to hit with GRAIL this year, pursuant to the clinical trial start in 2017. Is there \u2013 are there any specific guidance, maybe not dates, but events that we should be thinking about to signal that you guys are on track?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","There are. So the key things that we're working on \u2013 a key goal for 2016 is to make sure that we've down-selected to the final or near-final assay method. We're pursuing in parallel a number of different techniques here. We're likely to have both DNA and RNA, maybe even methylation work going on in parallel. And then, deciding on what the ultimate format of this test will look like by the end of the year could involve running sequential tests or multiple tests in parallel, and maybe across DNA and RNA. So that work has to happen this year. We're also moving ahead as rapidly as possible on the MSK partnership to help understand many of the fundamentals about what happens in cell-free DNA in the blood and to begin to correlate what we've learned there with what actually is happening through biopsy of solid tumors. And so all that kind of fundamental work that hasn't been scaled before is an important goal for us in 2016.","Third thing I'd say is getting the clinical trial very well-defined in getting it structured in a way that when we push the button, start collecting samples, we have the ability to do that, and to do it at scale. And that's going to require a lot of background work and potentially some partnerships at GRAIL we'll we need to form to get large-scale sample access. All of those things, we hope to finish in 2016 to be able to begin large-scale clinical trial work in 2017.","Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. It's very helpful color, really exciting. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you. First question on the MiSeq versus \u2013 I'm sorry, the MiniSeq versus the Firefly. Do you think that the announcement of the Firefly could impact interest at all in the MiniSeq? And if not, why not?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't, Dan. We thought a lot about that, and we wouldn't have said anything if we thought it did. If you look at the relative output of those boxes, it's pretty dramatically different, a factor of six times, and the capital cost is going to be somewhere just above half \u2013 little more than half for the Firefly. So I think that the kind of applications you're going to want to run on a MiniSeq are very different than what we're going to do on a Firefly. And for those reasons, we just don't think there's going to be any cannibalization in the near-term. It's a different market segment in our view.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","And Jay, can you elaborate a bit more on your efforts to, I think you said, tune the sales force? You have talked in the past, it is sometimes tough for the lower-priced product to get attention when you have big ticket items.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, it is. I think we're beginning to introduce some very specific things here, and Francis can elaborate on some of this. But Christian and Francis have been working on defining how we do specialist overlays, and I think for the first time, we're actually considering creating a part of the sales force that doesn't sell the high-end instruments. And as you know, up until now, we've taken the philosophy that salespeople know the best place to go and they know how to maximize their overall revenue and we let them be essentially market animals to go figure that out. But I think, for the first time, we're going to have to develop a sales force that sells just the desktop platforms.","So, Francis, maybe you want to give an update on where (47:51).","Francis A. deSouza - President & Director","Yeah, sure. As Jay said, look, there are number of things we're doing to more effectively and more efficiently get at that much larger, sort of low end of the market. So, one thing we are doing is we're looking to bring in a targeted sales force that targets that low end of the market, primarily people that are maybe earlier in their careers, and so are less on a per-head basis than more experienced salespeople, and also primarily people that are working the phones. And so we'll be expanding our inside sales capability to sell those products.","In addition, we are looking to expand our ability to digitally get to those customers through expanding our e-commerce capability as well as being smarter about using our instruments to drive additional sales.","And then we're also looking at targeted areas where we can add specialization by market into the sales force that will allow us to target some of the smaller labs that we haven't been able to get to yet. So those are the kinds of things that we're doing in the commercial team.","Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC","Appreciate all that color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions here.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","One for me, you guys have been really helpful giving color over the last couple of years on how things are progressing in the clinical channel. I wonder, as you think about the plan for 2016, how you would imagine growth for clinical progresses relative to what we've seen over the last year or two.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd say overall, we expect that to be far and away the strongest growth area for us, fueled in part by average risk coverage in the NIPT space. The kind of things we're doing in the PGS and IVF markets, I think are going to accelerate the number of IVF cycles that use various forms of sequencing. So, we think that's in the earliest stages of adoption, and we'll get into the higher part of the growth curve during 2016 and 2017.","We're waiting for the inflection point yet to happen in the oncology market, and as I said, we're seeing good uptake of TST 15. I think we need to really define what the regulated and reimbursed strategy is going to be in the oncology market after we get this next round of guidance from the FDA. And once we get that, I think it will help us clarify what kinds of products we want to push through the FDA and actually get approved. And that, I think, puts a serious inflection in the curve if we can figure out how to do that efficiently in ways where the time it takes to get approval doesn't mean that the product you ultimately get approved is obsolete by time it gets there. And so, those are the key issues. But the oncology market is still very, very, very early. And so we're not even up on the accelerating part of that growth curve, which we think will happen in the next couple of years.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Got it. And then on the Bio-Rad collaboration, I wonder to what extent you might be able to expound upon the plans there. I mean, given some of the chemistry and the work that we've seen come out of Bio-Rad, it's perhaps a little too easy to let our imaginations run in terms of what that could turn into. Can you expound a little bit on where you see that going? Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The collaboration is based on integration of their fundamental droplet technology, which they have working very well in other implementations for different applications, coupled obviously with our library prep and sequencing. The initial target of the collaboration is around single cell and their droplet approach is very effective for doing high-efficiency single-cell sample prep. So we're excited to move that program forward. As I mentioned at JPMorgan, I think that the method that is used there is quite extensible, and so we're exploring other applications that we may decide to put on that platform. And we're using both sales forces to sell this into the marketplace. So we're real excited about it, and we're getting good data already very early on in the collaboration. And as we said at JPMorgan, we expect to have it out on the market late this year or early 2017.","Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is now open.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Just from a high level on your 2016 guidance for relatively flat instrument growth but somewhat robust consumable growth, can you help us \u2013 just give some color on how historically generally consumable growth in the following year of instrument growth has been lower but you kind of expect the opposite in 2016, as instrument revenue growth was a little bit lower in 2015 but it seems like you expect consumable growth in the following year to be a bit higher?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, do you want take that?","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The way the math works with the increased installed base that we built this year, that plus the increased utilization and the mix of instruments is what drives consumable growth to be so much higher next year. So if you kind of look at this year's trend of instruments by quarter and you look at the continued growth in sequencing, it's always around the high \u2013 sequencing is always around \u2013 consumables, I'm sorry, always around high 20%s, low 30%s, even to mid-30% growth. And the flat instrument placement is sufficient to drive that.","Rebecca Chambers - Vice President-Investor Relations & Treasury","And Dane, we're not implying an acceleration in sequencing consumable growth in 2016 versus 2015. We're just saying that sequencing consumables will be a large component of the growth next year.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Exactly.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Got it. And on terms of MiniSeq, that 20%, 25% cannibalization rate, is that on a unit or dollar basis?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's on a unit basis.","Dane Leone - BTIG LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned that the HiSeq X was below the anticipated range, but that's due to the order of timing. Since several quarters since you began working with the \u2013 from your lower-utilization customers on improving their own utilization, have the utilization of those customers picked back up into an acceptable range?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think, the best way to describe it is that we've got a handful of customers at the very high end that are using their machines all out, and whenever they need to add any bit of capacity, it means, they have to buy a new machine. We have a middle group of customers that on average continue to move up the curve. They're getting more efficient. They're getting more sample access. They're getting better at running the overall pipelines. And so that continues to be kind of an upward pressure on the number. And then we have a small number of customers at the very bottom that frankly aren't doing very much and almost no matter what we do, it's hard to influence them to do more. It's either funding issues or a couple of these vanity buys that we've talked about or customers who are just waiting for something structurally to happen in their environment that's going to cause them to actually start using the units. And there is a small number of those at the bottom end of the curve.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","And you mentioned the weak funding environment in Japan, but could you provide some color on what you're seeing in China as well as in Europe? Thanks.","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I would say in Japan that things are starting to feel a little better. So in the fourth quarter, things got little bit better. It's not anywhere near back to where it was, so it's still got a long ways to go, which is why we remain a bit cautious about Japan as we've looked into our guidance for 2016.","In China, the research markets have been a bit challenging over the past year or two in terms of overall funding. But having said that, we have a couple of unique vectors into the Chinese market, one being the HiSeq X systems. There's a sort of disproportionate number of HiSeq Xs in China, which gives us good reagent pull-through and incremental potential sales into those customers. And our NextSeq sales there are good because of our NIPT business. So the downward pressure perhaps is the overall health of the research funding environment, but NextSeqs and HiSeq Xs are the strong uplift.","Europe's been pretty steady. In Q3, we talked about the fact that we had some business that we think got pushed out to Q4, and you saw that we had very strong results in Europe in Q4. So I think we recovered that business and more normalized the pipeline. When we exited Q3, we talked about a strong desktop pipeline that didn't quite make it over into Q3 revenue, and we're able to recapture that in Q4.","So I wouldn't read anything into the Q3 weakness there. I think overall, Europe's pretty stable.","Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to start on GRAIL, and just curious if you began soliciting any feedback or received anything from managed care payers, just given the magnitude of the investment you're planning on making the next few years. And then maybe off of that, just what do you think the criteria you need to demonstrate is in the clinical trials to earn reimbursement?","Jay T. Flatley - Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's a little too early to be talking to the managed care companies. We need to figure out exactly what this assay method is and get our own economic models done around knowing which stage of cancer we can detect. So there's some work we need to do before we actually embrace that community.","With respect to the clinical trial itself, what we're trying to do is demonstrate a stage shift. So we will screen a large population, identify on average for that small subset of that population that has cancer at that stage when they don't know they have cancer, what stage on average we detect it. We'll filter them out of the population and then sequence the remaining group a year later and then two years later, and demonstrate that on average the stage of detection is earlier. So that's a clinical trial design which we think will be sufficient to demonstrate that screening this population can be dramatically improved outcomes, but also improve the overall economics of cancer care.","Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. That's really helpful. And then just one wrap-up with Marc, on the balance sheet, I'm curious just given some of the moves in the market to start the beginning of the year. I'm curious how you're thinking about capital deployment and just the repurchase program or M&A from here. Thanks.","Marc A. Stapley - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I mean, no real change. We'll continue to \u2013 and our intention always has been to try and offset employee stock issuances with repurchases where it make sense. We still have a fair amount of discretionary at our disposal. The one thing we need to be cautious of in terms of repurchases is our U.S. cash, and that's something we continue to look at very carefully; no challenges or concerns right there at the moment. And then beyond that, we always want to make sure we've got plenty of opportunity for M&A should opportunities come up. And you've seen us do a few smaller ones in the past. And then continued investment as you saw in the 2016 guidance.","Operator","Thank you.
