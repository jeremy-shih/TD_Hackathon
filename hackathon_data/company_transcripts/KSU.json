At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the Company which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC. The Company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS Web-site, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, you may begin.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Thank you very much and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Kansas City Southern first quarter earnings call. We'll start with Slide 4. I don't think there is a big need for introduction. It's the same familiar cast of characters that you've seen here for the last several quarters. So let's go right into the first quarter overview on Slide 5.","I think if I were in a position to write a headline for this quarter, it would be, 'Solid and Clean'. First quarter revenues, volumes, operating ratio and earnings per share, were all records. So in addition to this being the first quarter that we have seen now in two years where we have seen year-over-year favorable comps in revenues and volume, it is also a record for the first quarter in those categories as well as operating ratio and EPS.","So, while there may be some truth in the element that this is an easy comp from some flooding and other service disruptions that we had in the first quarter of 2016, it's also very important to recognize that this is a record for those four important categories, volume, carloads, operating ratio and earnings per share.","Brian will talk more about the major business units, but we saw solid growth in four of our six major business units during the quarter compared to last year. And the two business units where we saw declines, they were relatively modest, and again, I don't want to steal Brian's thunder. He'll talk a little bit about the outlook that we see, favorable trends in 75% of our business, neutral in 25%, and we don't see any major business units where we are forecasting unfavorable or declining trends for the remainder of 2017.","Moving on to Slide 6, probably most of you saw, I know some of you have written about a press release we issued after the market closed yesterday announcing that we had filed our response to the Mexican antitrust authority COFECE Preliminary Report, which was published in March of 2017. We filed that press release separately from the earnings call because there is really very little that we are prepared to say about that at this point. The process is ongoing. The responses will not be made public and the statement from yesterday is really all that we are in a position to say at this point. So just as a heads-up, for those of you who are thinking about how to use your precious time on the Q&A, you might want to stay away from this topic. The press release kind of stands on itself, and again, because the process is still underway, there's just not much more we're going to say about it.","So with that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer.","Jeffrey M. Songer","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. Beginning with Slide 8, velocity for the quarter of 27.8 miles per hour has remained relatively consistent over the past several quarters and is a leading indicator of stability in the overall network. Dwell for the quarter of 23.3 hours lagged prior year's performance, but improved by 5% sequentially. Dwell in the north region of Mexico, in Monterrey, Sanchez and Nuevo Laredo, remains elevated versus historical levels, but all three terminals showed improvement over last quarter.","Total train volume in these three terminals remained strong with year-over-year and sequential growth of 10% and 5% respectively, and the team remains focused on reducing dwell in the region as we handle these additional volumes.","The projects to add capacity at grain and auto terminals in this region, discussed last quarter, are on pace to complete this quarter. Additionally, we completed construction of new classification tracks at our Sanchez Terminal during the quarter and are on schedule to construct additional tracks before the end of the year.","Also of note, total train volume over the Laredo gateway increased 13% over prior year. This includes franchise, non-franchise, loaded and empty carloads. Time to process trains across the bridge, which is another key measurement, improved 12% during this time in spite of the large increase in traffic. Overall, I'm pleased with our operating performance during the quarter and remain positive that the ongoing capacity and process improvements will continue to support the growing operation.","Turning to Slide 9, resources remained aligned. 4% of the U.S. workforce is in furlough status, 7% of locomotives are in storage and we remain well positioned to handle additional volume as required. No locomotives are planned for purchase in 2017, but additional locomotives are readily available [indiscernible] market, should volume dictate.","Productivity improvements during the quarter enabled us to handle 6% more volume with neutral headcount. To support the automotive segment from Q1 2016 through Q2 2017, we will have increased our bi-level automotive fleet by approximately 40%. The additional equipment coupled with strong operating performance in this segment enabled us to handle 38% more automotive volume during the quarter versus a year ago.","Major curfews on the southern portion of U.S. network and significant curfew activity on the KCS\/UP joint track in Texas had some negative impact to the operations during the quarter. As Mike will show, this also added detour expense as we rerouted trains around these curfew areas. This work is now largely complete for the year and ongoing curfew related impacts and detour expense should reduce.","Other positive items include a mechanical in-sourcing and contract restructuring activities, we have discussed over the past few quarters. These actions are performing as planned, and as you will see in Mike's presentation, we are recognizing the cost benefits. We anticipate these efforts will reduce operating costs by approximately $10 million for the full year.","Also of note, we have restructured our short-term incentive program for the operating department by adding operating metric goals in addition to our standard operating ratio targets. This plan will align individual performance with overall Company objectives and will reinforce our commitment to a strong operating environment.","Turning to Slide 10, our 2017 outlook for capital remains unchanged at $550 million to $560 million. This represents an approximate $30 million reduction from 2016. We remain focused on adding additional capacity in Mexico and supporting new business growth opportunities. Sanchez Yard construction continues as planned and the new fluids terminal project in San Luis Potosi is on target to open later this quarter. Additional capacity projects on the KCS\/UP joint track in Texas are estimated to be complete mid-year and should provide for additional fluidity in this region as well as benefit cross-border traffic flows.","Finally, the Sasol Terminal project is progressing well and is on schedule for completion late in 2017. I've included a photo showing the Sasol project and our adjoining Mossville, Louisiana terminal. Once complete, this will roughly double the footprint of our existing terminal and will provide 1,400 additional carload capacity for Sasol.","With that, I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock.","Brian Hancock","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. I'll start my comments on Page 12 where you can see first quarter year-over-year revenue was up 8% on 6% volume growth. The negative impact of foreign exchange to revenue was more than offset by strength in our energy, automotive and chemical and petroleum business. If you eliminate the impact of foreign exchange, our first quarter revenue would have come in at a strong 11% increase.","Volume increases of 30% in energy and 38% in automotive were the primary drivers of growth in the quarter. But we also saw strong revenue per unit increases in spite of the foreign exchange, driven by improved core pricing, fuel price increases and impact of positive mix.","Our energy line of business saw revenue up 64%, led by utility, coal and frac sand, offset by weakness in our crude business. Automotive revenue was up 25% over 2016, driven by higher year-over-year volume, but this includes comping the plant shutdowns we saw in Q1 of 2016.","We also saw 8% growth in our chemical and petroleum business unit, with solid performance in our southbound LPG business as well as lubes and oil product movements. The industrial and consumer segment was generally flat in the quarter. We continue to see competition with truck and barge for the metals business but we have seen some encouraging signs over the last few weeks. We also experienced temporary plant shutdowns at several of the paper facilities in the first quarter.","We see continued solid performance in agriculture and minerals business, with 6% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, driven primarily by increased demand in food products and grain. Our intermodal business continues to see stiff competition from low trucking rates and ocean shipping consolidation. Intermodal saw volume decrease of 1% and revenue decrease of 2% for the quarter. I'll speak more in depth about intermodal here in a few minutes.","On Page 13, you can see an updated assessment of our 2017 volume outlook. Our outlook for energy is improved, driven by higher natural gas prices and low inventories, driving an increase in demand for coal. Additionally, a resurgence in drilling is driving demand for frac sand.","Our automotive business should continue to see strong growth in volume and revenue. This is partially due to the temporary plant shutdowns we saw in the first quarter of 2016, but we continue to see growth in this business segment driven by additional manufacturing capacity and improvements in our service.","Chemical and petroleum should also continue to show growth due to the refined product shipments as well as some of the new plastics facilities coming online over the next 24 months. The ag business remains neutral, grain and food product demand remain strong, but we are comping a very strong 2016. Industrial and consumer will continue to be quite variable in the short-term as both steel and paper markets continue to see significant pricing pressure against other modes of transportation.","We have a positive outlook on our intermodal business, but it continues to see significant competitive pressure. I'd like to take the next few minutes to describe our plans in this important area. If you turn to Slide 14, you can see our intermodal business is broken into four segments, each making up approximately 25% of the intermodal portfolio. First let's discuss our cross-border franchise business.","This business segment has a positive outlook for the remainder of 2017 and these are the shipments that run on the KCS-KCSM across the border and provide a direct KCS solution for our customers. This service connects to most of the other Class I railroads to provide service to every part of North America. This service has been the focus of our new intermodal product announced with BNSF last year.","Next you can see the cross-border interchange business that provides service through our interchange partner, Union Pacific, with an exchange at Laredo, Texas. This segment has historically consisted of auto parts moving north and south in support of the growth in manufacturing on both sides of the border. As we said in the past, the UP is an excellent partner and the relationship is one of the most important that we have in our network. The KCS and Union Pacific are working together to expand this service and make it easier and faster to move products on this route.","Next is our domestic U.S. business that primarily uses the Meridian Speedway to service customers in the Southeast United States. This service has a dedicated train five days a week and is the fastest service seen in Dallas and Atlanta, using our interchange partner, [indiscernible]. This is the business that would experience the most benefit from any tightening that we would see in the U.S. truck capacity over the next few years.","Our final segment is that of the Lazaro and intra-Mexico segment. This business continues to be strong but faces daily competition from inexpensive trucking from the Port of Lazaro in the Mexico City. Our service provides a very secure and timeless solution for our Mexican customers. And with the opening of a new APM Terminal, we expect this portion of the network to be used as an alternate route for shipments bound for the Southeast U.S. from the West Coast ports. We also expect to provide additional services for shipments going southbound through Lazaro Cardenas, bound for Asia and the western side of South America.","On Page 15, you can see a picture of the new terminal which was dedicated two weeks ago by the President of Mexico and was attended by many of the KCS management team. Consistent reliable service in and out of Lazaro will continue to be a source of growth and investment over the next few years,. We believe this service will continue to provide our north bound customers with a shorter, more secure alternative to reach the North American consumers and it will also provide an excellent route for southbound products going to other regions of the world.","On Slide 16, I wanted to provide an update of our refined products business. As you know, the 2013 Mexico Energy Reform is being implemented this year. KCS has a growing number of terminals, either already built or in some phase of construction on our line. Our new refined products terminal in San Luis Potosi will move its first shipments in Q2, but KCS has already participated in over 1,500 cross-border carloads of refined products including diesel, unleaded and LPGs.","We continue to believe that the number of shipments could vary month-to-month during the startup phase of the new law, but we are encouraged by the current volumes in the agreements we're putting in place. Overall, this shift towards an open fuel market will be a positive for the country of Mexico, for energy exporters from the U.S. and for KCS.","Finally on Page 17, we wanted to provide an update on the petrochemical facilities being built along the Gulf Coast. Currently there are $169 billion worth of facilities under construction that will provide plastic resins for regions all over the world. These facilities are taking advantage of the low-cost natural gas found in the Gulf region.","In Q1, KCS sponsored a Plastic Symposium attended by more than 70 customers and service providers. At the meeting, KCS provided detailed plans on the infrastructure we've put in place to support this important and growing business segment. KCS is spending significant capital in the Mossville area, as Jeff noted, to support our agreement with Sasol. But we expect to ship products from many other customers as well.","Obviously, much of this product will be shipped to the major ports on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, but many of our customers are looking at shipping through Mexico and out of the port of Lazaro Cardenas as a way to create additional capacity and protection of supply for their global consumers. We believe this opportunity will benefit KCS and many of the other railroads because shipping by rail is the most efficient way to move these products. Overall, we believe these and other opportunities provide a robust environment for KCS to continue its growth in the markets that we serve.","I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Michael W. Upchurch","Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 19. First quarter volumes increased 6% and reported revenues increased 8%. Our operating ratio declined 120 basis points to 65.4% despite some significant fuel challenges. As [indiscernible] mentioned, it is $8 million year-over-year lag headwind. Additionally, we saw some mix changes in our peso denominated revenues and expenses which created a $3 million net negative impact to operating income, and you can find more details on Slide 27 in the appendix.","Reported first quarter 2017 EPS was $1.38 a share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter of 2017 EPS was $1.17 this year, a 14% increase in earnings per share. You can refer to Slide 28 in the appendix for more complete income statement details that reflects a $46.8 million foreign exchange gain, representing both a gain on our currency hedge contract and the impact of the remeasurement and settlement of our peso-denominated net monetary assets. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 34% and our average basic outstanding shares declined 1.95 million shares, reflecting 2.1 million shares we repurchased over the last 12 months.","Turning to expenses on Slide 20, operating expenses increased $24 million or 6% in the quarter. Foreign exchange benefited our expenses by $11 million. Increasing fuel prices contributed to $18 million in expense increases, but the $12 million fuel excise tax credit mitigated some of those negative fuel price impacts. Fuel consumption increased expense by an additional $6 million as we experienced carload growth of 6% and GTM growth of 12%.","Car hire was up $5 million year-over-year, $2 million due to carload growth and another $2 million due to the mix of equipment, with higher cost to automotive equipment to support the 38% carload growth Brian mentioned. Depreciation added another $5 million due to a higher capital base. And in the compensation expense line item, we saw wage inflation of $4 million and benefits inflation of another $4 million, and I'll talk a little bit more about compensation on the next slide.","And finally, as Jeff mentioned, maintenance on the trackage rights with a partner railroad caused us to detour more trains, increasing expense by $4 million in the quarter, and we would expect to see that decline in the second quarter, and already have during the first part of April.","Turning to Slide 21, compensation expense increased $7 million or 7% year-over-year. Wage inflation drove $4 million of the increase, while benefits expense was up another $4 million, largely due to funding of our U.S. union benefits obligations which continue to rise.","Foreign exchange contributed to a $3 million decline in wages. And finally, I would note that our mechanical in-sourcing drove compensation expense higher by another $1 million, but we saw corresponding declines in purchase services. Overall headcount levels excluding the mechanical in-sourcing were flat year-over-year despite the fact that we generated 6% carload growth, hence driving nice labor productivity during the quarter.","Turning to Slide 22, fuel expense increased $18 million or 33%, driven by fuel price increases of more than 20% year-over-year. Foreign exchange helped expense by $6 million while fuel consumption, again driven by carload and GTM growth of 6% and 12% respectively, caused a $6 million increase.","Finally, during the fourth quarter earnings call, we provided some guidance that we would expect the IEPS fuel excise tax credit to be approximately $60 million for 2017. Since then, fuel prices have increased in Mexico approximately 20% to 25% depending on region. However, in response to a variety of protests that took place in Mexico due to higher fuel prices, the Mexican government did decrease the IEPS component of fuel price to moderate the overall negative impact. While we don't have great visibility in the specific plan for fuel prices in Mexico for the rest of the year, we do currently expect the reduced IEPS tax to stay stable throughout the remainder of the year.","Clearly much has happened in last 90 days but we now believe our credit will be in the range of $45 million to $50 million, $10 million to $15 million below our original guidance. And we'll continue to closely monitor fuel prices in Mexico and make changes in fuel surcharges and purchasing practices to minimize any potential negative impact.","And finally on Slide 23, let me address our capital priorities. We continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flows into growing our business for the long run. And accordingly, we continue to estimate 2017 capital spend between $550 million and $560 million. However, we will continue to pursue investments in ventures, such as our refined products fluids terminal in San Luis Potosi to take advantage of the incremental growth opportunities that Brian discussed around the energy sector. For 2017, we currently anticipate incurring at least $20 million to fund our share of the terminal buildout.","In acknowledging the need to balance our capital spend with shareholder distributions, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend of $0.33 per common share. We also have now completed almost 90% of our share repurchase program by repurchasing 4.9 million shares at an average price of $88.82.","And finally, with the balance sheet that is comparable or better than most of the rail companies rated two notches higher than us, we continue to make gains in converting leased equipment into owned assets and now own approximately 68% of our equipment. The end result of this program has been an improvement in our operating ratio by approximately 230 basis points.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","All right, thanks. I think the team has done a good job of kind of explaining the quarter and the outlook, but let me just touch on a couple of points to draw your attention or highlight certain things. The revenue growth and the volume growth that we saw was really pretty solid across the board.","If you look back to Slide 12 that Brian covered, I think the strength of some of our business gets muted by the scale on this slide. So ag and min, and chemical and petroleum, look kind of small but we saw a revenue growth in those business units of 8% and 6% respectively.","Feel very good about the cost performance. As Mike highlighted, our volume growth was 6% but our GTM growth was 12%. So I think Jeff and the team have done an outstanding job of managing the cost and improving the operating performance.","Intermodal, we wanted to go a little bit deeper into the intermodal segment because that is one area where we might be a bit of an outlier. We're not happy with the performance for the first quarter, but we clearly feel like we can see a path to grow through the remainder of 2017. I think Brian got into some of the reasons that we are confident about that in his presentation.","And then again, I just want to reiterate the long-term outlook. Many of us have had a chance to be in Mexico, particularly a few times so far this year. We have seen a brand-new Kia plant, a $3 billion plant that opened last year that's still ramping up toward a production level of about 600,000 vehicles a year. We toured a soybean processing plant that's in the process of being expanded, that once completed will represent the largest soybean processing plant in North America and most of their raw materials will be sourced from the United States.","Brian talked about the APM Terminal. For those of you that haven't been to Lazaro, it is just an incredible place. And once the APM Terminal ramps up to full capacity and they complete Phase 2 and Phase 3, this very well could be the second largest international container terminal in the West Coast of North America.","The Plastic Symposium, we are starting to become more active in our business development efforts with our customers and shippers and intermediaries who are interested in moving those millions of tons of products out of the United States, as many of those products will be exported as a result of the U.S. being a low cost producer and we think there are some very interesting solutions to move those into Mexico as well as through Mexico for South American and Asian markets.","And then finally, the energy and refined products, that is happening today. We are active in terms of investing to support that growth and we've seen many other destination terminals being built and more in the pipeline to be able to handle those products over the coming years.","So the long-term outlook continues to be extremely positive, and I'll close where I started. I think the way I look at this quarter is solid and clean. So with that, we'll open up the line for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler Brown","Mike, quick question about the proxy, so in the proxy you give the OR the fee incentive comp is tied to. I think this year you made the 100% payout based on a range as opposed to a set number. I'm just curious if you could comment on why you changed that to a range. And then I know it's not guidance, but should we assume that that 100% payout threshold is kind of effectively what you're budgeting internally?","Michael W. Upchurch","The second part of your question, 100% is roughly on the AIP, about $18 million a year. And then have some PTU obligations in Mexico and some long-term incentives that target gets you to about 25%. With respect to the ranges, that's really a reporting of last year's range. And so I'm not sure I completely understand your question. We haven't actually disclosed anything for 2017. That would be in next year's proxy.","Tyler Brown","Okay. Let we ask this. I think last year, 2016, you accrued maybe 200% on the AIP. But assuming this year if you hit just say 100%, can you talk about what the accrual differential would be in dollars?","Michael W. Upchurch","Yes, I mean in essence I tried to just give you that. It is about $18 million, Tyler. So if you were at 100%, it's about $18 million. If you're at 200%, it would be double that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Pat, as you said, a clean quarter this time around, and it looks like you have a couple of overhangs to get past, that may not be in your control with policy out of D.C. and the antitrust stuff. But once you get past that, and let's say we have clarity on that the next months or so, how could you know your number is going to be from that point on? In terms of your view on macro, some of the noise you've gone through the last several months, the startup costs you've had, do you think you're past that now, and the stuff that's in your control is coming along pretty well?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes, I feel very good about the things that are within our control. And as far as the impact of some of these other things that are not in our control and the impact that that would have on our numbers, I just don't know how to answer that question, it's just too hard to know exactly where some of these things are going to land. But it feels good. It certainly feels better to me and to us at this point on both of the obvious fronts, the NAFTA and COFECE.","I think you're seeing some of the campaign rhetoric die down, and as the new administration is becoming populated with cabinet members and staff members and getting focused on doing work, it certainly feels to us like it's going in a good direction.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. And can you give us an update on that in terms of what you're hearing from customers and are your customers feeling the same way about that and are they sounding more constructive about ramping up investments in Mexico or do they still think, are they like sitting on the sidelines until we have a little more clarity there?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes, I think customers are still forging ahead, and again, many of the projects that we talked about, the new projects in Mexico in particular, were well underway before the election results were known. But we really have \u2013 I'll frame it this way, we only know what we know based on customer activity that was in process and customer activity that was planned, investment activity, we haven't seen any significant pullback, which is one of the reasons that we are not pulling back from our capital investment plans because we have to be ready for that growth once it occurs. And until we see evidence that our customer investment activity and growth actively is changing, we really have to stay the course.","But again, we're spending a lot of time on this topic. We have talked to a lot of congressional leaders, policy makers, people who we believe are going to be very influential in the process, as well as quite frankly one of the areas where we are really taking the lead, in fact in the last two days we've had few conferences here in the Midwest with U.S. ag interests. This is a very important topic to U.S. agriculture and all of those farmers and all of those Midwestern Red states who voted for President Trump are very interested in making sure that international markets, and particularly Mexican markets, remain open for their products.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","With respect to the opening of the San Luis Potosi facility, should we expect any sequential uptick in refined products in the second quarter or will the ramp be weighted more towards the second half of the year?","Brian Hancock","This is Brian, I'll take that one. We will probably see our first shipments later in the second quarter. So you'll see obviously the ramp up happen more towards the back end of the year. But certainly what will be open will be tracks where we'll be able to take product directly from the trains into trucks. And so as that business starts to grow, you'll see those definitely in the second quarter and on throughout the year, and then as the terminal fills itself out, you'll see the higher volumes later on in the year.","Allison Landry","Okay. And I guess just more broadly thinking about growth in cross-border volume and the various capacity projects that you have going on in Mexico, is there anything on the horizon from a capital standpoint to expand or upgrade the Laredo bridge?","Jeffrey M. Songer","This is Jeff. We're focused on process improvement at the bridge right now. Some day into the future that's something we will probably need to address. I don't see that for several years. I think we've got a lot of opportunity to continue to streamline customs processes, working on some international crew activity that should allow us to increase our throughput before we need to move forward and build a new or second bridge or additional crossing.","Keep in mind, we also have the crossing at [indiscernible] gateway that we interchange to UP. That's a relatively unused [indiscernible] versus, comparatively to Laredo. So, there's a lot of additional capacity on that gateway as well that we could utilize into the future.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And also, Allison, I think much of the expansion that we are doing and planning for the future at Sanchez is going to improve the efficiency of the way we cross the border. And then as Jeff mentioned, I think there are some process and technology initiatives that are well underway and showing good progress that we think will also be helpful to improve capacity and efficiency at crossing the border.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Wanted to ask you about two of the I think longer-term drivers of growth that you mentioned and that you have talked about for a while, and just really ask about kind of visibility with customers. So the first is on the plastic side. Have you got any customer commitment to use Lazaro to actually ship the plastic pellet, whether it would be container, I assume via container, through Lazaro to access markets in South America, or is that something that still is kind of remaining to be developed? And then also on the, I think you commented on the APM Terminal, saying, we think shipments to the U.S. will come back. Is that based on visibility of Maersk or someone else saying they are going to do that or is the comment more like, well, we think longer-term it can happen again?","Brian Hancock","This is Brian. I'll take your question. From a plastics perspective, we have been running test shipments for a myriad of companies across a number of different options that they are all going through. The important piece to understand is, the amount of product that's going to be coming out of the Gulf region is significant, and most of the companies are looking for one, two, maybe even three ways to get their product into the global market.","So you think about shipping to the West Coast of the U.S., shipping to the East Coast of the U.S., and then having some type of an outlet for protection of supply, Mexico is a perfect opportunity in that space. And so that's really the place that we play. And we believe through our test shipments that people are excited about the opportunity. I would tell you, it's primarily Hopper car down into Mexico, transloaded into a 40-foot container, and then off to the port.","You could also see containers, maybe 53 is down, transload, 40 is out. So there is a big opportunity there, but we're going through all of those test shipments right now. And really the high volumes come on over the next 24 months. So people are still waiting to make those commitments. We certainly have a commitment with Sasol that has been announced for several years. So I think it's important that we continue to go down all of these different paths because people are looking for multiple ways to move their product.","From the APMT perspective, we have obviously been very close with Maersk for many years and we stay close to their plans, as they have made the infrastructure investments, as we have made the infrastructure investments. Typically these are seasonal. They are also going through an industry consolidation that has had a pretty significant impact on the way that containers move throughout the globe. And so, we're participating with them in that.","But Lazaro as a port, not only for containers but also for finished vehicles and others has become kind of a standard, and now if you go down and you look at the technology that's been implemented in APMT, the productivity they are going to be able to have, and then our renewed service and consistency of our service, the investments that Jeff has talked about, when all those things are in place, that's going to be a very viable port and way to bring products in and out of North America.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I'll provide another little color commentary. When we were at the ribbon-cutting ceremony a couple of weeks ago in Mexico, we were told that there were seven containers on a vessel that was parked at the APM Terminal that were U.S. plastic products that were shipped to Lazaro for export to Asia. So as Brian mentioned, we're in the test phase.","The direct answer to your question, do we have commitments at this point, customer commitments for that business? No, but we met with a few weeks ago or maybe months now one of the companies that's building one of the largest cracker plants in the Gulf Coast, and I will tell you that one of their biggest concerns and issues that they talked about as their plant begins to produce and ramps up was infrastructure and how these plants and the investments that's being made in the Gulf Coast, the capacity that's being added will exceed the demand in North America. So these products are going to need to move to other markets around the world. And their concern is infrastructure, port capacity, highway capacity, they are looking for every available option that makes sense, and we think we have a very good option for those products to move through Mexico, particularly to South America and Asia.","And one other point, and you're already starting to see this with ExxonMobil's announcement just a few days ago about a new ethylene cracker plant that they're going to build in Texas. This capacity that's coming online in the next two to three years, this will be fully utilized and sold out within a six or seven year period according to the customers that we're talking to, and they all are beginning to plan new plants in the 2022, 2025 timeframe to add the next wave of capacity that will be needed to satisfy global demand.","Michael W. Upchurch","Tom, this is Mike. Not to over-answer that question, but I think plastics going out of the port, remember containers is less than half of our revenue that we generate at Lazaro, and a good bit of the rest of it is in fact chemicals, plastics going out, auto, and some grain.","Tom Wadewitz","Thank you for the very thorough answer. I just had a real short follow-up. Can you give any update on the BNSF service and kind of how well that's \u2013 how that's ramping up?","Brian Hancock","Sure, Tom, I'll take that. We are very happy with the service. I would tell you that both operating teams have done a great job in creating stability for the expectations of the customer. We're continuing to see the volume increase and we have \u2013 we are very pleased, we're probably a little bit ahead of where we're at when we think about commitments that we've had together, the bids that we've won together, and we feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to meet our expectations and probably exceed our expectations on that service. So we're very pleased with the way it's going right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","I had a quick one on refined products. Brian, if you could just give us an update on the full liberalization of prices in [indiscernible] Sonora, an ongoing open season with Pemex I guess across the country, and then just more broadly, how the daily market adjustments really worked across the other regions and has that really triggered any pressure on peso denominated trucking competition so far?","Brian Hancock","Greta question. Obviously we're watching it very closely as is everyone else. I think the key is the March 30th date went by and there were no major, major disruptions in that Sonora region. June 30th is obviously the big day. That's when you actually hit a population center that will have a significant impact. And we believe that it's going to go very well. Actually there is the supply which was the concern. We think we've got that taken care of. There's a number of investments that have occurred and also people have been very \u2013 there are a lot of people working together, which I think has been beneficial.","We haven't seen really the fluctuations. Mike talked a little bit about how the government has really I want to say taken the hit for the initial increase. We saw that in January. They backed up a little bit of that in February. But right now everybody is stable and we believe that it's going to go up very well.","Obviously June 30th is a key date. You start moving, that last six months you're moving 95% of the population of Mexico into the market. And so we feel like it's going to be \u2013 that's why I said in my comments that we'll see some fluctuations, but we think it's all going to be positive. And right now it appears that we're going to be able to meet all the demand. I think the people are very focused on working together. So hopefully that gives you a good answer.","Brian Ossenbeck","Yes, thanks Brian. So just a quick follow-up on sentiment and investment in the country in Mexico, Pat or Jose, you mentioned there wasn't really any significant pullback as you're talking to customers across the spectrum. But we have seen some reports in the press about China's Great Wall motor considering [indiscernible] plant in [indiscernible] the latter would be of interest to KCSM. So just curious, since the high-profile step-back of Ford earlier in the year, has anybody stepped in to fill that gap?","Brian Hancock","I'll go ahead and take that. Pat is kind of pointing at me. We have not seen anyone pull back except for that initial Ford announcement. Many of the producers, you talk about Great Wall, you talk about others \u2013 I know that there is a couple of other automotive companies that are looking to moving into the production space that's been opened up there. Toyota will have their facility open here in another year and a half. The Mercedes Infiniti opens up this year. Kia, as Pat mentioned, we went through that plant and just the enormity of their plans on a global production basis.","So we have not seen anyone pull back and they have asked us very specifically, please do not stop your investment, please do not stop your investment in capacity, in fluidity. So we feel very comfortable that there's going to continue to be a great flow of auto parts in from the other North American countries, assembly manufacturing in Mexico and then those vehicles being shipped all over the world. The ports, we're seeing a lot of product go out through Lazaro, Veracruz. There's just a number of things that are happening. So we feel pretty good about the foreign direct investment that's happening in Mexico.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And I'll go back to, I didn't really finish my comment I made earlier about we only know what we know. Obviously what we don't know is plans that may have been underway but not made public or that we weren't aware of that have been put on hold. No way of us really assessing or commenting on that. But for those projects that we were aware of, obviously those that were already underway, with the exception of Ford, and I think we can say that we know that site is one that Great Wall is interested in. And you mentioned San Luis Potosi. Ford had made some progress on that facility, about $400 million in the facility when they changed their course and made the decision to move back to the U.S. But based on plans that we are aware of and projects that were underway, with the exception of that, we just haven't seen any evidence that customers, that our customers are pulling back.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Congrats on a clean result here. We definitely like to see the improvement. Pat, I'm going to address the [indiscernible], I'm not talking about the competition, commission, but if we go back a few years, your stock definitely had a big valuation in the group with the idea that Mexico could be big growth. Now we're concerned about what's going on south of the border. So can we just address from a U.S. investor perspective, we understand regulation and the U.S. pretty well, but you do have a couple of things that are unique down in Mexico apart from the concession agreement. You do have an exclusivity period that ends in 2027. So I was wondering if you could address that. And then secondly, just at a high level, if I'm a captive shipper in Mexico, what are my options today and how does it differ from regulations in the U.S.?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Let me answer I guess the first part of your question first. Our position is, we want to compete on the basis of running the best railroad in Mexico, and I think we do, from a service, from the way we face with customers, from a security standpoint. So we think we have a superior product in Mexico and we run the business to maintain that competitive edge, which then we believe regardless of what happens, whether there is something that comes out of the current investigation or just sort of running the normal course of the original concession, we will be able to protect and defend and grow our existing market as well as compete and grow in any potential new markets, whether that's after 2027 or prior to, and have success there as well.","So I don't know if that's an entirely satisfactory answer but I think if we continue to focus on running the best railroad in those markets and providing the best interconnection to the rest of North America through our own network and through our very good relationships with all of the other Class Is in North America, we'll be fine. And now I've rambled on so long that I've forgotten your second part of your question.","Brandon Oglenski","What other modes of transportation [in that do you compete] [ph]?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Mexico is an incredibly competitive market, and if you look at the press release from yesterday, you will see links to three OECD reports that have been issued and prepared over the last couple of years, going back to 2014 when we were looking at the threat of possible reregulation of the rail markets legislatively in Mexico, which I'm sure all of you remember. I'll just draw your attention to those reports and you can take a look at the research and conclusion that the OECD has reached about the competitiveness of the transportation markets in Mexico.","Brandon Oglenski","I appreciate that, Pat, but I guess if I could decipher then, am I hearing you correctly that I guess beyond 2027 then there could be potential competition for parts of the concession that you have today, is that correct?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Certain provisions of the exclusivity are relaxed, but there is still a need for the regulatory agency to determine that there is a lack of effective competition in certain markets. So again, I'll fall back to my earlier statement, we expect and we plan to run a competitive efficient railroad and attractive service to our customers, and that kind of at the end of the day is going to be the most important consideration.","Brian Hancock","Brandon, if you read those OECD reports, about 13% of traffic in Mexico is rail traffic. The rest of it are other modes of transportation. So that gives you a sense of the level of competition.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And I'll just say one other thing, and not going to great depth, but I think you all, most of you are familiar with the case for and against trackage rights really representing effective competition. And again, if we stay focused on running the most efficient, safest, customer-focused railroad in our markets, we will be just fine.","Brandon Oglenski","All right, thanks guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","So you made some changes this year to the [indiscernible] incentive targets. I believe you added a free cash flow component and that was at least last year based entirely on margin. I was hoping, Pat or Mike, could you address kind of what the Board's thought process was in making this change, and looking forward, do you see any further evolution in the way that the senior management team is incentivised at KSU?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I'll take a first shot at that. I think the evolution is that distributing, and by the way, this is something that's happened across the entire industry, moving away from operating ratio as the sole financial metric for purposes of annual incentive payouts. I believe we were actually the last railroad to do that. And the way I would say it is, when your operating ratio is in the high 80s and you're spending 20%-plus of your revenue on capital expenditures, you can do that math in your head, there is a very high degree of urgency and need to improve your operating ratio to support the investment in the business.","We are not declaring victory on operating ratio. We are not suggesting that we can't further improve operating ratio, and I believe we will. But when your operating ratio is in the mid to lower 60s, the need for further improvement isn't as great. We are clearly \u2013 at this level of profitability we are earning returns to support reinvestment in the business and we believe that our shareowners are more interested in seeing growth in return on invested capital, in cash flow and in earnings per share, and not solely focused on improvement in margin.","Bascome Majors","Thanks for the comprehensive answer. That's all I've got.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Want to circle back to some of the energy destination terminals that you guys remarked a couple being announced, some being planned. Could you talk a little bit about the timing of the construction of these projects and how many will fall on or near your lines?","Brian Hancock","This is Brian. All of the facilities that I mentioned are on our line. And so we have right now about somewhere between 14 and 16 that are either completed, under construction or in the permitting process. So we feel very comfortable. Now many of those are I would say to the north. So you think about Monterrey, Salinas, San Luis Potosi, San Jose [indiscernible], those types of locations. Many of them small, they start with the transload, the ability to take a railcar, go into a truck, but many of those now have tank-in. So we've already shipped to two of the Pemex facilities, as was mentioned in the script.","So when you think about where we're at, we're looking at large facilities, small facilities and all of the regions where we serve primarily. So we feel very comfortable that it's going to continue to grow. The market is now just starting to understand where the need is, and so we'll continue to keep you updated as we know more.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Konigsberg","I just had more of a broad question. So the volume performance obviously fairly good in the quarter, just curious when you take a look at the portfolio, what's changed as far as your expectations by market, what you see now versus coming into the year what has improved and what may be a little bit more challenging?","Jeffrey M. Songer","Here's what I would tell you. I think chemical and petroleum is performing as we had hoped, even better than we had hoped, and so we feel very comfortable. Now those are complex deals. They are very important that you have security and all those things in place. So we're going to continue to see it grow.","Industrial consumer, primarily driven by the paper and steel markets, and so they fluctuate as to which mode they use, but we feel like we're competing well and we feel like the market is coming back in a couple of places that we serve specifically. So I think we're going to be flat to up there.","Ag and min continues to be strong. Pat mentioned the new facility down in Monterrey. It's an enormous soybean crusher and we feel it's right on our line. We feel very good about that. The foods business continues to grow.","Energy, I think coal has returned, but for us the more important piece of that is that we're able to move it where it works within our network. We have great product diversity across a number of different product lines. And so it allows us to the days that we have to get very, very discounted to move a lot of or even minimal coal is no longer there.","So we feel very comfortable that we're in a good place in our energy business, frac sand. There's a lot of fracking going on, a lot of people need natural gas in Texas. So that's a good space. The crude business has still not performed but we feel very comfortable in our energy business.","Intermodal, we talked a lot about. I don't have anything else to say on that. And automotive, it's going to continue to grow. We said in our last call, in the next two, three years, there is a lot of production coming on, there's a lot of products, especially parts that move back and forth. So they are going to continue to grow at the pace that we've already laid out. So I would say we're upbeat. Since 75% of your product line are green, you feel pretty good about what's going on.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","I had a question about the peso improvement. So we have seen the peso sort of bottom in January and improve pretty decently from those levels. Just want to get a sense if you're seeing that flow through any pieces of the business, is it too early to see that sort of benefit and should we think about it as it goes through 2Q and maybe beyond if we can sustain these levels, how should we think about sort of this dynamic change within currency?","Michael W. Upchurch","I would tell you that currency is going to help us as it gets stronger. With the peso coming back to a normal level, it allows the cheap trucking that we compete against, that's a key, when we're in a space where we're in U.S. rates or we have rates that are being impacted by the cheap trucking, that's a big deal for us. So as the peso strengthens, trucking comes back to a normal level. We're more competitive and we believe the security and the service we provide, we are a better deal. So we feel comfortable that that's going to be a good [guess] [ph] as the peso returns to a normal trading range.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","I wanted to ask about pricing. First, would you be willing to share the core price number for the quarter? And secondly, we've seen the continuation of a pretty competitive environment in the truckload sector year-to-date. So I was wondering if you still have confidence in achieving above inflation pricing this year.","Brian Hancock","This is Brian. Our core pricing came in at that mid low single-digits. We feel very comfortable that we'll be above inflation and we feel very comfortable that the trucking market is going to continue to be very competitive. We're going to have to be of good value and we feel like we are, but our core pricing, we feel very comfortable that we're going to move into the \u2013 to continue to be above inflation where we're at.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Justin, just to be specific, it's 3%-plus in the quarter. So it's ahead of where we ended 2016.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","You had talked about some of the heavy volumes you had gotten from one of the auto plants that had just recently opened but you had some service issues on the line and the region. It sounds like I think that line opened up and you're up and running now. Can you talk about the volumes, maybe the progression of volumes? Is the plant fully up and running and giving you those volumes now, is it still accelerating?","Brian Hancock","This is Brian. I would tell you I don't think we said anything like that.","Jeffrey M. Songer","This is Jeff. I think as I mentioned on Q4, Kia was the one that we talked about from an infrastructure that Kia continues to expand their footprint. If you recall, they opened without really their track infrastructure in place. And so we are handling that, still handling that in our Monterrey yard, which I think I went into some detail in Q4. But that construction is moving well. We took the tour. We saw that.","So here, kind of toward the latter part of Q2, we expect that track work to be done in their facility and move that out of our Monterrey Terminal. So that should help the fluidity and help our product. Brian may talk about the Kia overall volume.","Brian Hancock","I was just going to add that the overall volume in Kia, they are producing at the levels that they thought they would, maybe even a little bit higher. So the operational work that Jeff is doing, literally they put him in a truck, haul him downtown to Monterrey and put him on a railcar, that's a tough move. So we're going to get a lot of benefit once that track is in place, but they continue to grow at the pace that they thought they would.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group ","Quickly, can you just clarify if the incentive comp this year assumes 60 million of the fuel tax credits or 45 million to 50 million? And then just the bigger picture question, just coal yields were up 34%, is that interchange rates like tied to higher natural gas prices, is that mix? I guess I'm just not sure how we should think about coal yields and maybe overall mix going forward rest of the year.","Michael W. Upchurch","On the first part of the question, Scott, we did budget for the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year. So we're going to need to manage to that number.","Brian Hancock","And on the coal side, Scott, we not only picked up an increase linked to haul on some of our facilities, but some of the temporary pricing that was put in place two or three years ago is no longer in place. So we feel very comfortable that where we're at is kind of where you're going to see us for the next few years from a pricing perspective.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger","Just to kind of round up, speaking to network fluidity in Mexico, some issues at the end of last year and some staffing changes, a little bit of impact on dwell time, could you just give us a status update and maybe impact on operational ratio right now and going forward, the potential impact there?","Jeffrey M. Songer","This is Jeff. So I think I kind of covered where we were for the quarter. The volumes still remain very heavy on the north and the dwell still a little overweighted. I kind of pointed out that velocity number really stabilizing, which is what I'm glad to see. So it signals we're providing the consistency for our customers.","I've been in the chair now for about a year, so getting the resources aligned with headcount, getting the equipment in line, I think we're there. And so, the capacity that will come online with Sanchez, that will continue to help the fluidity. As we've said, we haven't backed off any of our investments to help with other mainline. I don't talk about those smaller project citing extensions and capacity improvements. We're making around the entire network. But we're so very committed to say increasing our capacity and infrastructure to help the overall fluidity of the network.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Kauffman","A quick question on cash flow and modeling, I realize the share repurchase is like about 90% complete, but there is still a couple of hundred million of free cash you're generating this year. Can you talk a little bit about priority uses for free cash?","Michael W. Upchurch","This is Mike Upchurch. I tried to in the presentation indicate that our priority was going to continue to be investing in the business. We obviously have a dividend in place, our share repurchase program expires June 30 and we'll be having those conversations with the Board prior to expiration, and we'll have some additional communication once we're through those discussions.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I think the one change, I'll draw your attention to the final slide that Mike covered in the presentation, is in the 'invest in the business' category we've added this concept of growth accelerators. Projects like the San Luis Potosi fluids terminal, we've had those discussions internally and with our Board, and I think you should probably expect to see us do similar types of activity where we see opportunities to invest in facilities that are very complementary to our core business and drive revenue and volume growth on the railroad.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ottensmeyer, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay, I think we have covered about everything that is certainly on our minds and thank you for your participation and we'll see you in 90 days. Goodbye.","Operator","Thank you.

Now I would like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2018 earnings call.","Our CEO, Pat Ottensmeyer, is unfortunately out of town and will not be able to join us on the call today due to the passing of his mother yesterday afternoon.

For the quarter, revenue increased 5% on 1% volume growth. Brian will discuss our revenue performance in more detail, but we delivered strong results in most of our commodity groups led by automotive, intermodal, and chemicals and petroleum which continues to benefit from growth related to Mexican energy reform.","Offsetting those growth areas, we did experience weakness in our coal business driven primarily by our Texas utility that closed a plant in January.","The North American Rail network congestion did impact both revenues and operating expense during the quarter. Congestion affected primarily our cross-border business as cycle times slowed and we experienced some challenges positioning equipment in and out of Mexico. Both Jeff and I will touch on this later. However, we believe weakness related to network congestion will gradually improve during the second quarter.","We are confirming our mid-single-digit volume outlook for fiscal year 2018. We expect volume growth to improve throughout the rest of the year, particularly in our chemicals and petroleum business, as destination terminals in Mexico continue to be built or expanded to carry more refined product.","Sasol and other plastics facilities will begin production in the back half of the year and we would expect intermodal to continue to grow. So far, in April, we have started to see some acceleration in our carload trends.","For the first quarter, operating ratio was 65.8%, an increase of 40 basis points versus prior year. Although we are somewhat disappointed with the year-over-year increase in our operating ratio in the first quarter, we continue to believe we will deliver OR improvement for the full-year 2018.","And finally, first quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.40, while adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.30, represents an increase of 11% versus a year ago.","Let me turn the call over to Jeff Songer now.","Jeff Songer","Thank you, Mike and good morning.","Reviewing the key operating metrics for the quarter on Slide 7, velocity of 27.6 miles per hour was relatively consistent with prior year and prior quarter. Overall Dwell versus prior year improved 1%, while there was some variation in performance of some major terminals. Solid operating improvements in Mexico terminals including Monterey, Sanchez, and Querataro, was partially offset by increased Dwell intermodal terminals in Laredo and Nuevo Laredo that experienced elevated Dwell related to South Texas congestion.","As outlined in our response to the STBs service outlook inquiry, the majority of our network is performing well. Resources are at sufficient levels with respect to both crews and locomotives. Congestion in South Texas and Houston has had the most impact to operating performance during the quarter, but are starting to show signs of improvement. We do expect some lingering effects in the second quarter as fluidity in this region returns to normal. Congestion in this region also caused some expense inefficiencies during the quarter driven primarily by elevated re-crews over time and car hire expense related to multilevel cycle time.","As Brian will illustrate some volume impacts were also felt due to the congestion primarily related to cross-border movements of agriculture and automotive. However shippable automotive ground count levels have been reduced by about 50% today versus peak first quarter levels, signaling better availability and flow of automotive equipment.","Other notables for the quarter include our mechanical insourcing initiatives and contract restructuring which we've discussed in prior quarters. These initiatives are achieving their projected benefits and we anticipate approximately $7 million of net expense reduction for the year.","Lastly, I would like to provide a brief update on PTC. In summary we are progressing on schedule and project to be fully equipped on our network by the 2018 deadline. Approximately 40% of our PTC route miles are in service -- revenue service demonstration including our most dense corridor between Kansas City and Shreveport. Thus far, we are experiencing only minor impacts to our operations as we begin transition to PTC operation.","I would like to acknowledge the efforts of all the individuals who are working tirelessly to ensure our PTC implementation as a success.","I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock.","Brian Hancock","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone.","I'll start my comments on Page 9 where you can see first quarter year-over-year revenue was up 5% and volumes were up 1% despite headwinds from the closure of a large utility customer facility in Texas and the impact of network congestion with a number of rail partners in the U.S. As you can see most of the business units saw increases in both volume and revenue with revenue per unit benefiting from higher fuel surcharge and favorable foreign exchange impact.","The fuel surcharge impact is noticeable year-over-year primarily due to higher fuel prices including FX and rebasing fuel for certain customers from a line haul rate perspective. Given that FX and fuel surcharge drove the year-over-year growth in our Q1 revenue per unit; we wanted to spend a little more time on the year-over-year RPU reconciliation. As we indicated on the Q4 2017 earnings call, we expected our revenue per unit to be impacted by mix this year as our profitable but relatively low RPU intermodal business continued to grow throughout 2018. Additionally, we signaled that the reduction in long haul utility coal volumes due to a plant closure would pressure the RPU and this was exacerbated in Q1 by 6% reduction in grain.","However when we look at revenue per unit by business unit and strip out the FX and fuel for year-over-year, all business units with the exception of intermodal, still had a year-over-year increase in revenue per unit driven by mix and price which we believe is more reflective of the overall strength in our business. Furthermore, we also see in our 2018 same-store sales being in line with previous guidance of 3% with our renewals trending ahead of that pace.","The chemical and petroleum business unit revenue growth of 10% was primarily driven by solid performance in our longer length of haul, Southbound refined products, and LPG business as we continue to see growth from Mexico Energy Reform.","Petroleum revenue grew at 26% from the strength in Mexico Energy Reform partially offset by volume decline in our heavy fuel oils due to some maintenance issues and a temporary plant outage at a facility in Mexico as well as a teacher protest in Michoacan.","The industrial and consumer segment also showed improvement in the first quarter with revenue growth of 4%. This business segment has benefited from strong cement shipments driven by strong construction demand. Additionally, we saw strength in lumber products due to a tightening truck capacity market.","The agriculture and minerals line of business revenue was down year-over-year on a 5% volume decline driven by grain and food products. The decline in grain business was driven by the U.S. network congestion and softer overall demand. Food products experienced a shift in sourcing trends primarily in soy meal and volumes declined were partially offset by favorable pricing and longer length of haul.","This quarter the energy line of business decline was driven by previously announced closure of a power generation facility in Texas. This decline was partially offset by higher volume and pricing in our crude oil business. And the crude business saw a slight resurgence due to the increased production in Canada with decreased pipeline capacity compared with the increasing Brent and mine spreads.","Intermodal revenue increased by 9% driven by new cross-border services as well as growth in U.S. domestic lanes.","The Lazaro business was negatively impacted during the quarter due to the teacher protests and the protests were halted at the end of February, but still they had an impact on overall quarterly volume.","Our automotive business was up 17% year-over-year with improvements in both volume and revenue per unit. The volumes increased due to an inventory carryover from Q4, increased plant production, and growth in the import volumes at Lazaro, partially offset by challenges that Jeff mentioned in equipment availability.","During the quarter, we provided several very unique solutions for our customers which help to keep vehicles moving in spite of the congestion experienced by some of our North American rail partners.","On Slide 10, we provide an outlook for 2018 for each of the business segments. Our full-year volume outlook remains in the mid-single-digit carload growth for full-year, however the outlook by business unit has been updated to reflect wagon performance year-to-date.","Starting with the chemical and petroleum group, Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a significant focus for 2018. Volume growth continues as storage comes online later in the year. Additionally, we expect plastics to grow in the second half of 2018 as new petrochemical capacity comes on line. We also expect solid growth in intermodal with continued focus on conversion of cross-border and U.S. domestic freight currently moving by truck and solid growth out of Lazaro Cardenas.","We'll continue to see good performance in our automotive segment with growth in the mid-single-digits which is in line with most of the third-party industry estimates as well as some of the market share gains which we've seen with some of our biggest customers.","We continue to expect positive economic activity in 2018 which would positively impact our industrial and consumer businesses in both steel and paper. We'll continue to see positive impact of military but year-over-year comps could be difficult given the heavy shipments that we experienced at the end of 2017.","We expect agricultural min volumes to be neutral to slightly down due to ships and sourcing trends in food products and lingering North America rail network congestion. We're working with our customers to provide additional services into Mexico that should help us continue to grow this important segment. We're encouraged that the congestion that has impacted this segment in Q1 appears to be potentially improving which will improve overall grain flow.","We expect the strong remainder of 2018 in food products and grain but do not believe that we will be able to recover all the shipments that were delayed or lost in the first quarter.","As previously noted, we expect our energy business to be down year-over-year as it will be impacted by the closing of the coal fired power generation facility in Texas. However, we do expect continued growth in Canadian crude as we previously mentioned.","On Page 11, we provide an update on Mexico Energy Reform. As we mentioned this important change in energy policy in Mexico is having a significant impact on our volumes versus Q1 2017 our volumes were up 287% and our revenue is up 275%. Most of this has happened with only a single facility currently with storage tanks. Included on this update is a diagram of all of the origins and destinations we're currently working with as well as an update on the destinations that we've previously announced.","As you can see, tanks are now being constructed throughout the network as well as new projects being announced in the Gulf at both Altamira and Veracruz ports. We continue to expect steady growth as this infrastructures build out in the coming months and years.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks Brian.","Let's move to Slide 13, revenues increased 5% to $639 million the result of a 1% increase in volumes along with favorable impacts of fuel surcharge to cover rising fuel prices and an improving Mexican peso currency.","Our first quarter 2018 operating ratio was 65.8% compared to 65.4% a year ago. We did not see an improvement in OR during the first quarter due to lower than expected volume growth, $3 million of year-over-year incremental costs resulting from casualty expenses, and an approximately $2.5 million negative impact in operating income resulting from the North American rail service issues. But we continue to believe we will see improvement in our OR for the full-year 2018 as volumes grow.","While we were somewhat disappointed in lack of OR improvement, we continue to believe volume growth will improve throughout 2018, and along with the favorable pricing environment and disciplined expense management will lead to an improved OR in 2018 as we continue to target strong incremental margins.","First quarter 2018 reported earnings per share of $1.40 increased 1% over 2017 first quarter, while on an adjusted basis excluding the impacts of foreign currency, EPS was $1.30 or 11% higher than 2017. A reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS can be found in our Appendix on Slide 24.","A more detailed income statement is available in the Appendix on page 23, but I wanted to touch on one item of note. During the first quarter, we did experience lower equity in earnings of affiliates that declined $3 million year-over-year, while other income declined $1.4 million year-over-year. After-taxes these below operating income line items contributed negatively to EPS by $0.03.","Moving to Slide 14, let me spend a minute discussing some key changes in our taxes in light of tax reform and this should be pretty consistent with what we communicated back in January on our fourth quarter call.","As you can see in our effective tax rate reconciliation, our U.S. statutory rate has declined from 35% to 21% providing substantial benefit to KCS. Offsetting that U.S. statutory rate benefit is a higher tax rate in Mexico where we pay a 30% rate. The negative impacts of the Guilty tax which adds three percentage points to our effective rate, state income taxes, and finally, the foreign exchange impacts.","And as a reminder, our hedging program generally offsets any positive or negative impacts of foreign exchange risk in the income tax line item and for the year we expect the net to be positive about $1 million. We continue to project a 30% to 31% adjusted effective tax rate for the full-year.","One more note on taxes, we currently believe that KCS's guilty tax impacts are at least partially due to unintended consequences as Congress was intending to prevent transfers of intangibles to low tax offshore jurisdictions with the tax rate less than 13.125%. We are actively pursuing regulatory and\/or legislative remedies as KCS operates in a foreign jurisdiction with a relatively high tax rate at 30%. And the final tax law was not limited to intangibles rather based on income generated on all assets.","With that, let's turn to expenses on Slide 15. Operating expenses increased by 5% or $21 million. A stronger peso resulted in a negative impact to expense of $8 million, while U.S. fuel prices contributed $5 million to the expense increase, and depreciation and increased headcount contributed $4 million and $3 million respectively. I'll cover compensation, fuel, purchase services, and materials and other and a little more detail in the following slides.","On Slide 16, compensation and benefits expense increased $5 million or 4% and is inclusive of some of the inefficiencies created by traffic congestion in Texas. Foreign exchange contributed another $2 million to our overall comp and benefits expense increase. In the bar chart you can see our overall increase in headcount, excluding the insourcing of service contracts was 3%. While this increase was above our carload volume growth, most of the increase related to Teenie personnel in Mexico to allow us to better handle growth for the remainder of the year, and we would expect our headcount trends to be flat to slightly up throughout the remainder of the year.","Turning to page 17, net fuel expense increased 13% largely due to fuel price increases and foreign exchange impacts. As you can see in the bar chart U.S. fuel prices were up 19%, while Mexico fuel prices were up 8%. Rising fuel prices negatively impacted operating income by $3 million in the quarter due to the timing lag in collecting fuel surcharges.","On Slide 18, purchase services declined mainly from the insourcing of a car repair facility. Offsetting that decline was slightly higher comp and benefits expense from hiring those employees, along with a $1 million parts expense in the materials and other expense line items. We do expect to see a $7 million reduction in overall expenses in 2018 from these insourcing activities, and finally, we experienced increased casualty expense of $3 million.","Let me quickly cover our capital allocation priorities on Slide 20. Our commitment to continue investing in our business is as strong as ever given our growth opportunities across our network. Our 2018 CapEx guidance of $530 million to $550 million remains unchanged. We expect 2018 will be the third year in a row that our CapEx and CapEx to revenue ratio has declined.","In addition to capital requirements we will continue to explore investment in ventures to enhance our core revenues, particularly around Mexican Energy Reform.","Turning to shareholder returns of capital, during the first quarter we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares at an average price of $108 and to-date we've repurchased 2.9 million shares at an average price of $106 under our repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in August of 2017.","Finally, we're very comfortable with our balance sheet and credit metrics but we'll continue to evaluate the acquisition of leased assets that provide positive financial returns.","So in closing, let me provide a few thoughts on the regulatory and political landscape as I know these subjects are on your mind. First, we were pleased to announce during the quarter that the COFECE issued a final resolution that dismissed the preliminary report along with its finding of a lack of effective competition for interconnection services. This final resolution represents the end of the COFECE investigation.","Second, we are encouraged that NAFTA negotiations are progressing and appear to be moving towards resolution hopefully sooner than later. Although we cannot predict whether negotiators will reach a resolution prior to Mexico's Presidential Election in July, we are very pleased by recent progress and hopeful that these negotiations result in a modernized NAFTA agreement that will benefit all North American economies.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question today is from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Mike Upchurch","Good Morning, Ken.","Ken Hoexter","Great good morning Mike, my condolences obviously over to Pat and his family. But it just -- maybe you can step back and quantify, you talked a lot about the impact of UPs, I'm sorry other rail network congestion and the impact on results you mentioned a couple million dollars but I'm interested in your comment that things seem to be improving maybe you can kind of address that and kind of walk us through you talked a little bit about that the specific cost categories but how quickly can they get back to normal, what needs to happen and kind of the all rank to KSU you as you move forward?","Mike Upchurch","Jeff?","Jeff Songer","Yes, Ken, I'll take that firstly we did not say UP, we said overall congestion in the region, the way I look at this where as we've spelled on I think the energy is doing a much better job today understanding that we are a system of very interconnected system. So for us the impacts were slowdown really from between Belmont and getting things back and forth across the border to Texas.","Impacts to us as I outlined higher re-crew rates. We probably could have had some crews furloughed if not or for the just extra effort and extra resources that during these types of issues similar as what we saw with the hurricanes, we just have to load up the resources a bit more to ensure we keep fluidity for the traffic and for the customers. I think Mike outlined the financial impact of that from a net income perspective.","Mike Upchurch","Yes, $2.5 million of operating income impact.","Jeff Songer","So that's a rough guess on the elevated expense net of any potential revenue loss opportunity. Where we're at today things are feeling little better and how I measure that just the fluidity, I mentioned the auto ground counts for me that was a big item here we had over substantial amount of ground counts here during Q1. Those will relatively quickly clean themselves up, we're still not where we want to be but you've seen a lot of movement in the auto here early into Q2, we're seeing that on the volume side, you're seeing that just from the ground counts that are winding down.","So that equipment is flowing better. We are gaining more reroutes around some of the congested area I think during Q1, you had a lot of Texas, a lot of the routes in Texas we're really seeing some congestion in this harder route any carriers traffic in and through, in and through the areas. So I think we're feeling better on that now. We are receiving some reroutes and some detour routes for various commodities.","So again I don't think we're out of this quite yet. I think we understand and I think our resources are at good level. And as I mentioned that the need to retain excess either locomotives or crews to ensure that we don't further contribute or aren't able to help work our way out of this issue here, it's elevated the cost bid, so.","Ken Hoexter","That's helpful overview, I appreciate the insight there. If I could just get a follow-up for Brian, you\u2019ve got a lot of contracts I guess just ramping up U.S. fuel with grain seems to be coming back online, the tanks. Are there specific kind of months or dates where you kind of look and see that acceleration is it gradual? I noticed you noted that auto plants not really picking up for full production till 2019, anything you can kind of detail in terms of timing of the ramp up in volumes?","Brian Hancock","Yes, I would tell you, Ken, I think the key for us is watching how the plastics -- the manufacturers start to come online obviously we feel pretty comfortable. We know what's going to happen in the automotive space that will be at the very end at least, the new facilities that come out at the very end of the year. But right now we're actually picking up some market gains, so we feel comfortable there. As you see tanks come on even with the increase that you've seen you have to realize that's only a single facility that has tanks specifically on the line for refined products.","So I think we now have, I want to say six or seven facilities that are building tanks across the network and so that's going to continue to go probably you won't see many of those tanks get completed until the third quarter and then certainly some in the fourth quarter and then it will just continue from there. So we feel comfortable there but overall the intermodal -- the only thing I want to say intermodal as that continues to grow certainly that is at the surge type capacity environment, so you see it always each year between June and August, September that's when those big volumes come from an intermodal perspective to feed the typical retail environment. So we feel pretty comfortable with our estimates right now and right now we're very focused on fluidity and making sure that the customers have a great way to get product in and out of the ports and out of Mexico as well.","Ken Hoexter","Really helpful.","Mike Upchurch","Ken, maybe just a couple other real quick thoughts intermodal -- much of our intermodal business is carried in Mexico and with the improving peso puts us in a little better position than we have been over the last two to three years to be in a soft service is obviously growing and we've got peak season which we expect to be good coming up.","Auto just to give you a data point, our volumes have accelerated here in April to 16% growth so far in the quarter and then while we wouldn't want to rest laurels on easy comps in the third quarter, remember a year ago, we had a pretty major impact from a hurricane that set us back with the volumes.","Ken Hoexter","And did you say that teacher strike was over done or just off your network or is it still lingering?","Brian Hancock","No, the teacher strike that impacted us is now off, I mean it's over but I would say we continually watch that I think Jeff and his team do a great job of making sure that really if somebody does get on the line at that space that it's off the line, it doesn't really impact any service just the -- the things we saw in February did impact us and impact us there during the quarter from a volume perspective. But we feel pretty comfortable; we've got our arms around it as long as some major event doesn't occur there.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Mike Upchurch","Good morning, Ravi.","Ravi Shanker","Good morning everyone, thanks. Just to follow-up on something you just said about the extra resources needed to fix the service issues of the railroads, just to make sure I understand are these temporary resources that you need tied over the current bottlenecks or not just you also the other rails or do you think this is more of a kind of long-term resource addition to get these service running smoother for the long-term?","Jeff Songer","Ravi, I think if you look at our headcount growth, we've talked about trying to certainly have headcount growth below that of volumes. So I think what you saw really in the quarter is volume as we've stated here didn't quite achieve what we saw due to the various reasons, I feel pretty good where we're at with headcount.","Continuing to look for opportunities to improve productivity, really the expense drivers with re-crews so the headcount base that we have they're more than fully utilized and the re-crew rates it takes multiple crews versus fewer crew to get across territories when you see this type of congestion.","So it's just -- it creates demand with the re-crew rate with the total expense to get that train from Point A to Point B. As we kind of confirm volume for the rest of the year, I think again that's why I think we're in pretty good shape when it comes to resources to be able to then handle the certainly last three quarters, last half of the year as we expect the volume to pick up a little bit.","Ravi Shanker","Great. Also you briefly touched upon in your previous response but in terms of where the peso is and the intermodal market, how would you characterize the current competitive environment right now on the trucking side?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Ravi, I would say we feel very comfortable, we put in place a new program for some of our international shippers which we feel has been accepted very, very well. We've had some great wins in the normal bid process that happened in February both domestic and international in Mexico but also that that Peso has a big impact from a trucking market perspective and as it comes back down that's only going to benefit us because we have not only a great program in place, but we have capacity to be able to utilize not only on the BNSF service but the UP service, all of our intermodal products both cross-border and into Mexico are impacted by that and as that Peso strengthens, it's just a real benefit to us against the truck market.","Ravi Shanker","Great. And I may just sneak quick one, then, Mike you said that the other income affiliate income declined in the quarter, if you can elaborate a little bit more on kind of how we see that through the rest of the year?","Mike Upchurch","Good question. We did see a decline in other income and equity and earnings, the other income decline was due to a land gain that we recorded a year ago, didn't have that again in the first quarter 2018 and then our equity and earnings declined $3 million year-over-year that's primarily comprised of PCRC, our Panama Canal Railway and FTVM which is the operator in Mexico City.","I think the PCRC business is challenged a little bit right now in terms of container volumes, Maersk has moved some of their traffic from Valbao to the PSA port and that\u2019s had some impact there. But I wouldn't expect it to be a material drop in equity and earnings over the full course of the year maybe just a slight decline.","Ravi Shanker","Great, thanks very much and our thoughts are with Pat and his family as well.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Ravi.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Mike Upchurch","Hi, Allison.","Allison Landry","Hi, good morning, thanks. Thinking about Lazaro going forward and I'm sure they're no way to really handicap on that Teacher's Union is going to protest but it's all risk that the Ocean carriers shippers that are calling on the port may divert traffic away from Lazaro because of the network disruptions and could this potentially be a risk as we think about the upcoming election?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Allison, this is Brian. I think that\u2019s a good question but what I would tell you is both port facilities, the Hutch facility and the AT&T terminal are marketed. They are now fully marketing their product out of Lazaro. As a result not only the ports and the railroad but also customers are now almost in constant contact with both the state government and the federal government to make sure that these protests don't impact commerce.","And so what I would tell you the importance of the capacity at Lazaro is not only important to the railroad, but it\u2019s important to the steel industry, the auto industry and if you look at the -- when these things occur we'll have probably over 30 to 35 companies join together along with the government to make them go away. This particular item that caused the February delay, I would say is probably a little bit of a different type of an item but we believe that there's not really going to be an impact.","Now certainly if there were some type of major delay, it potentially could but right now we just don't see that this was a very specific issue and there's enough people focused on it, including over the last couple of times, the military has actually come in immediately and removed the teachers because of international commerce needs. So we feel pretty comfortable that everyone is focused on and it becomes more and more an important part of the infrastructure of Mexico we feel pretty comfortable that we're doing and have done everything we can to make sure it's a fluid piece of railroad.","Mike Upchurch","Allison, this is Mike. Just one other thought there remember only about half of our Lazaro revenues are intermodal. We have a number of other products there that predominately have to move by rail. So we shouldn't see a whole lot of impact things like steel and autos that move in and out of that port.","Allison Landry","Right, okay. That makes sense. Thanks. And then on the cross-border intermodal piece, so we\u2019ve been seeing very strong growth there, is that the longest length of haul segment within overall intermodal and if so is it fair to say that as this piece of it grows over time should the overall profitability of the intermodal franchise improve as a result of that?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, Allison this is Mike. Remember we report those as two carloads one in Mexico, one in the U.S. to the extent we carried on our own network and we do get a little bit better length of haul with the BNSF service that does help our profitability and will take as much of that traffic as we can because those trains still have a lot of capacity. We've been what Brian 13, 14 months into the --","Brian Hancock","Yes.","Mike Upchurch","Service with BNSF and it's still showing very nice growth. So it is definitely profitable business.","Brian Hancock","Absolutely.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Mike Upchurch","Hi, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. Wanted to see if you could give us kind of an update comment on the connectivity that you have with the Port of Veracruz with respect to automotive, I think that's something you had in the past kind of paired with the idea that as BMW came on there was commitment to get that connectivity in place, so just wondered if you could offer thoughts on where that's at and when that might become a growth driver in automotive as well?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Tom, this is Brian. I would say that we actually had a meeting with BMW again this quarter. We're both working very hard on that obviously the connectivity is going to continue to be focused on the end of this year into 2019. But all of those plans that we've had in place here for the last couple of years as that plant has been being built they are all continuing down and down that path and we've had significant meetings on planning for the volume, certainly the parts coming out of Europe all of those things.","So we feel very comfortable that our connectivity with Veracruz is going to occur just like we have planned and that we should continue to see growth there. Certainly I would say as well don\u2019t forget the export piece of automotive going on through Veracruz into Europe and some of the -- like Brazil or Argentina down in South America, it's an important part that we're tying in and I think everybody's working very hard on that, it just taken little longer than we had hoped but we feel very comfortable it's going to be done in the next year.","Tom Wadewitz","So it's fair to think about that as significant auto volume growth driver in 2019 that's right way to think about it?","Brian Hancock","Yes, I think it's certainly going to be a great pathway for all of our products to come out of Veracruz and go into Veracruz. The global sourcing piece because Mexico is becoming such a manufacturer of choice, it's not just automotive, it's anybody who builds or sells anything in Mexico, Veracruz, Altamira, Tampico those are all great ports and each one of them is building out infrastructure over the next year or two years and so we feel comfortable in all those ports on the Atlantic side of the page if you will.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. Appreciate that. And then the second question just along the lines of how we think about crude by rail and framing the volume opportunity. Obviously that stepped up nicely it's still off of I guess a reasonably low base. But you -- it seems like there is room for meaningful growth, how closely do you tie your growth to what we're hearing from CP and how they talk about things? I don\u2019t know if you can comment about how much your crude by rail in connection with CP and kind of how directly we would link growth in Canadian crude by rail to your growth?","Brian Hancock","Yes. I think the way I would think about is we are certainly an attachment to many of our North America partners. CP being one of them, but there is a number of the big rails that we attach to as we deliver into the Southeast U.S. and into some of the larger facilities in the Gulf.","And so we have to talk to each one of those railroads as they speak, but we are very confident in our ability to move the freight. Jeff has been working extremely hard to make sure that we have the right capacity and right fluidity to be able to handle this train link, we're working with all of the terminals with all of the companies that we work with down in the Gulf to make sure that they can receive the trains but we're very comfortable, we're going to continue to grow that, we've got lots of spreads, they move around on us a little bit and they've been moving quite a bit lately. So we're watching those very closely but given the pipeline capacity, given the amount of crude that's available up in Canada and in some of the Northern facilities, we feel pretty comfortable it's going to continue to grow and as you listen to the other railroads, we\u2019re certainly in support of all of our partners that are bringing crude towards the Gulf.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Upchurch","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey good morning guys and certainly our thoughts with Pat and his family as well. I wanted to ask about the sort of the Energy Reform opportunity, so we thought about this for a while and it certainly has been part of the business now for the last year or so, first quarter stepped up nicely from the run rate kind of in 2017. I think it was mentioned earlier in the call that this is business basically from one facility with storage as you think about the six or seven that kind of come online over the course of let's say the next year or so. Is there any way we can kind of translate the business you're doing today to what ultimately the opportunity set looks like for you, is it simple with sort of looking at this quarter and multiplying it by six or seven or there other kind of nuances can you help us sort of frame this up a little bit?","Brian Hancock","Yes, sure. I actually love the question because we get asked that question probably more than anything else. What I would say here's a way we think about it is these facilities are being built to handle unit trains because that obviously keeps the price per barrel low and so unit train responsibility and being able to receive that that type of capacity is kind of our key focus. What we're looking at is making sure that the facilities that we are assisting and also the facilities that we\u2019re trying to service are looking at capacity in the right way.","Overall, we believe that it's going to continue to grow at a rate that is pretty close to what the government has said how they want to change the number of days available in Mexico, I think it's going to be very difficult to say when is it going to ramp up but if you look at the number of companies here is what I would say to focus on. Focus on the retail outlets that are non-PEMEX and those will be announced by other people, other companies the companies that are setting up that retail environment because that's really the key on how much we'll move and how fast it will move.","Now if you were to ride the train or take a car ride through some of the major parts of our railroad, Monterey's, SLP North, Mexico City you will start to see non-PEMEX retail outlets as those come online, it's much easier to understand how fast you'll be able to move and how many barrels you'll be able to move. But most of these facilities want to be able to handle a train or maybe let\u2019s say a train every other day at least and so that's kind of the way they're building out, that\u2019s the way their plans are set up and so we\u2019re trying to make sure that we have the capacity to handle that type of volume because that's when you think about a train, it's about 60,000 barrels and so it's that kind of turn that you have to watch.","But I would look at those metrics that come out from the other energy companies around number of retail outlets and serviceability from a distribution, their midstream segments and that's probably the best way to get it. But the government wants to move from two days to 10 days over the next seven years and you\u2019re going to see pretty much a ramp up of storage and logistics capacity to handle that.","Mike Upchurch","Chris, I think it\u2019s safe to say this is going to continue to stair step up for us with one of the facilities expanding their storage capacity and our own facility at SLP getting tanks in during the third quarter, I think we see a pretty material step up in 3Q and 4Q.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, all right, that's helpful. Those are great parameters to work with, I appreciate it. And as a follow-up when you think about sort of the OR improvement that you\u2019re targeting for the full-year, you just sort of called out some costs during derailment, there is also service issues in the quarter you had the teacher strike. We think about sort of the progression, volumes are getting better, is it fair to say that year-over-year OR improvement starts as early as 2Q, I just want to get a sense of sort of how transitory these costs really are and sort of how we can think about the timing as the year progresses?","Mike Upchurch","That\u2019s a good question obviously it\u2019s challenging to grow incremental revenues at a high rate when you don't have a lot of volume growth that we showed in the first quarter here, also rising fuel prices and FX are essentially a 100% OR businesses. So when those are growing, it makes it a bit more challenging but we do believe that we're going to see volume step up in the second quarter, obviously 20 days or so and April doesn't make for a quarter but we're seeing some nice results so far.","So I would expect us to see sequentially some improvement in OR going into 2Q and then 3Q, 4Q for a lot of the reasons, Brian, and I mentioned earlier that's when your plastics begins ramping up Sasol opens up in the back half of the year, the refined products which we just discussed will begin to grow from current levels because of all the storage facilities being built, intermodals are going to see a nice ramp, the crude is we're optimistic about that.","But as Brian said, the spreads maybe aren't quite as wide as they were a month ago, auto will continue to accelerate. So I think we have a lot of conviction in those drivers and are excited about the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Reustle","Yes, thanks for taking my question and just wanted to follow-up on those dynamics around OR, obviously kind of toughest start for the year than expected, are there any underlying trends here that have actually been better than you expected whether it\u2019s volume or pricing that drives that confidence or had you always kind of baked in that much improvement in the back half of the year that even with the weakness in the front end you'll still be able to meet the full-year improvement?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Matt, good question. We did build our plan with third and fourth quarters seeing much better volumes and profitability. I think first quarter what was off to a little slower start; I mean we did have some obvious issues that we've talked about here with respect to teacher strikes, with respect to the congestion that we've seen in the North American rail network. We had some negative comparisons around Holy Week in Mexico being in first quarter versus second quarter. Not that it was a big driver but the revenue accounting standard pushed couple of million dollars of revenue into future quarters from first quarter. So we -- I think the first quarter is performing maybe just slightly behind where we thought we would be but I think second, third, and fourth quarter for all the reasons we've talked about we'll see growth and improving profitability.","Matt Reustle","Understood, understood. And what also on pricing, I think I heard earlier that it was 3% underlying pricing in the quarter, can you touch on that I think that the past few quarters have also been 3%, are you seeing any momentum there acceleration on pricing front?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Matt. I would -- this is Brian. I would tell you we feel very comfortable in the pricing environment we're in right now. First off service has improved, I think that people are feeling the effects of a capacity constrained truck environment which allows them to look at other options certainly in the intermodal space but also in some of the other places where you could use a rail car to move it a long distance and transload.","So we feel very comfortable and a lot of our industries are doing very well, the paper industry is having a great year from our perspective because we're on the box plants as Amazon grows, as FedEx and UPS shipments continue to go higher boxes there's more boxes out there. So that's good for us.","If you look at the steel now one of the things you hear a lot of political rhetoric obviously we're now fully into an election cycle down in Mexico and that election rhetoric in the steel industry along with some of the things that have happened from the U.S. perspective, there's a lot of bullishness that that industry is going to continue to grow.","So like Mike said, we have a lot of great signs going, our capacity is there, our fluidity is there, we just had a little congestion in the South -- the Southern part of our U.S. network and we feel like that's breaking up, we are working very hard with our partners and so there's a lot of good things happening out there, Energy Reform, automotive. So we're bullish, we think it's going to be a good year.","Mike Upchurch","Now just one last thought, we have seen a little bit of an acceleration in pricing around contract renewals that we had in the first quarter and I think that's always an important data point to look at because that's going to be reflective of what you're going to see in the next four quarters. So Brian mentioned roughly 3% range what we've been seeing for the better part of the year but in the first quarter, our renewals did step up from that level.","Brian Hancock","Yes, it's higher than that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Upchurch","Hi, Justin.","Justin Long","Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on the volume outlook for this year, you're sticking to the mid-single-digit growth target for 2018, but could you help us understand the quarterly cadence of that target over the remainder of the year, I'm just curious if the right way to think about it is that you guys see mid-single-digit volume growth in the second quarter and then maybe a ramp to high-single-digits in the back half as Sasol and some of the refined product opportunities kick in, could you just help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about that?","Brian Hancock","Yes, I would say Justin, this is Brian. I would say, we are going to continue to see a ramp up as the second quarter kind of comes in obviously Jeff mentioned automotive has started out strong as we kind of taken that ground count down.","So we feel very comfortable in that space, intermodal obviously ramps up in the third quarter because it means retail season certainly grain and food products is going to continue to get better as we get better fluidity and so yes we're going to see those ramps continue.","The tankage you guys kind of know when those are coming on there in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So certainly that's going to have an impact on those quarters, so I would say certainly in that space. But overall most of the industries look better as they come in on the second half; we talked about plastics in the second half. So Q2 is going to strengthen because we're going to have better fluidity, better capacity much better, less congestion, but then as those tanks as the intermodal season hits as automotive continues to strengthen we're going to see that in the back half. So yes I would say you\u2019re thinking about it correctly.","Mike Upchurch","And again 20 days in April doesn't make a quarter but we're running roughly 4% increase so far in the quarter. So I think you're going to see a little bit of a step-up in 2Q don't forget in 3Q we had a pretty substantial negative impact a year ago in the hurricane and then we would expect the fourth quarter to continue to show some growth.","Justin Long","Okay, that's very helpful and maybe asking a question earlier a little bit differently, Mike, I know you've always talked about 50% plus incremental margins in the business. There were some challenges in the first quarter that you\u2019ve talked a lot about, do you think getting back to 50% incremental margins in the second quarter is achievable or is that something it's more likely to occur in the back half?","Mike Upchurch","We'll certainly with volume growth looking better than the first quarter, I think it's more achievable than it was for us in the first quarter that's always been our target to target 50% you have a lot of issues quarter in and quarter out but for the full-year, that continues to be our target we will see where we end up with that. But I think growth is a key contributor to that incremental margin target of 50%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Upchurch","Hi, Bascome.","Bascome Majors","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Following up on the carload business a bit some of your comments earlier the truckload capacity market that we're seeing right here and the rate increases I mean that's arguably unprecedented here. In intermodal certainly seems to be anything across the rail industry but carload it just feels like some of the larger class ones have been slow to regain mobile share in the kind of market we've seen over the last call it three to six months. And you guys have been its KSU user growth oriented railroad for a long time; do you have an opinion on why the larger class ones have not been able to grow this carload business more aggressively in this backdrop?","Brian Hancock","Yes, I would tell you Baskin. This is Brian. I try not to speculate on anybody's business except our own. All I can tell you is I feel very comfortable that we are a great modal solution for the customers that we serve and we are being asked to do more by many of those customers in the Southeast. There's a lot of growth, there's a lot of construction certainly paper is strong, the steel market continues to strengthen with construction and so we feel very comfortable and at least the things that our customers are telling is rail is a great option, so you have to ask everybody else how it impacts them but they're excited about rail as an option in the capacity constrained environment and we feel very good about that.","Bascome Majors","All right. So to paraphrase you feel very good about the carload outlook for the broader industry going forward.","Brian Hancock","I feel very good about the carload volumes for Kansas City Southern Railway. Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks morning guys. So you guys mention sort of uncertainly here on the elections couple of times. I'm just wondering is that purely sort of macro NAFTA uncertainty or as you think about bigger picture implications of the election is there anything specific to rails meaning is there anything policy wise from Obrador good or bad in your mind from -- for the rail industry I don't know maybe that's a question for Warren.","Warren Erdman","Yes, we actually have Jose Zozaya our President in Mexico on the call. Jose, do you want to address that?","Jose Guillermo Zozaya Delano","Yes, I just wanted to comment that we have been able to get in touch with Obrador and all the candidates teams and talk about this in our concession terms all of them have expressed directly to us their interest on respecting their concession terms and of course the rule of law. So we feel very confident in that sense.","Warren Erdman","I might add that a strong associate of Mr. Obrador was before the Wilson Center in Washington and he indicated that they would be supportive of any NAFTA agreement reached before the election. I think that's a pretty strong sign in favor of a good outcome.","Scott Group","Okay, good to hear. Thank you and then maybe it's Mike one for you just sort of long-term, so I think we all tend to focus on your growth opportunities long-term. I want to ask you about long-term operating ratio, so obviously seeing some pretty remarkable improvement in CSX this quarter and maybe some of the arguments about short length of haul don't apply anymore, so I know it's been a few years since you've given us sort of a breakout of U.S. versus Mexico OR but a few years ago your OR in the U.S. is around 70%, do you think that that's an OR that can go to the low 60s and do you have opportunities or things you're working on to get us there.","Mike Upchurch","Well, preface it by saying we haven't provided any long-term OR targets but I think as a team we all agree and are committed to continuing to improve our OR. I think in our case we believe growth top-line growth at profitable and good margins is going to allow us to continue to generate great year-over-year EPS returns. Typically comes in three pockets, growth which we think we'll do just fine, pricing environment continues to look pretty solid and we have some additional cost opportunities. We haven't really fully implemented trip optimizer which is a fuel saving technology on the locomotives that will lead to some future benefit the insourcing that we talked about will continue to allow us to right-size our expenses and I may have Jeff comment on this because I think you're going to see this transition take place here in 2018 labor productivity is something we're very focused on. Jeff, do you want to comment a little bit?","Jeff Songer","Yes, you know, Scott, [indiscernible] we talk about and haven't maybe talked about the fuel in the specifics. Those things continue to move forward we haven't -- we've basically have been out and running that on the U.S. side only. We've got some labor things that are just now concluding here from Mexico that are going to enable us to really utilize that technology and gain some more efficiencies in the fuel specifically in Mexico.","Mexican productivity we're continuing to work on things with crew size, train length, all the initiatives that are out there in the industry were certainly focused on you take an example like a BN train that started off is growing well but it's still not at capacity, so with that deters from train length a bit but in a good way and that we have a lot of capacity remaining on that train to continue to grow and add it's profitability there.","I think there's that's where we're focused and those things will translate them into the specific operating metrics such as intermodal train links as those businesses grow over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Upchurch","Hi, Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and please send my condolences to Pat and his family. On the -- just going back to the fluidity and network and some of the challenges last several months and just really like there's pretty little resiliency to come back from disruptions I know you've had quite a few in a row but you just talk about your confidence and you're seeing some of these costs, rate and things improving in the second quarter. And how much of that the rate specific to Houston and just thinking of the ramp up in plastics that looks in general growth in freight carloads, you talked about earlier is that really the pinch point that can handle that sort of growth or is that risk that we could see another bottleneck to go further down the road here?","JeffSonger","Yes. We are pretty specific we have seen our STB response that that territory South Texas, Houston and that has been the choke point if you will and I think you've heard that from others in the industry what I hear as well from others in the industry is resources are being added. I know we along with others in that area have been spending a lot of CapEx on capacities specifically us with trackage rights across our Laredo subdivision. And so I don't think it's a lack of certainly resource on our end.","As I mentioned right now the demand the excess demand in climbing out of these sluggish periods if you will it just takes more resources that I don't see what I'm measuring right now is our re-crews have improved a bit since Q1 peaks if you will, so that's a clear sign for me. I mentioned also the other detour routes which clarifies for me that other routes within in and around Texas, in and around congested areas are starting to improve it as well. So couple of tangible signs for us here we're seeing things regain fluidity we're seeing some of these cost metrics come back down a bit. As I mentioned I still think we're going to have some impact in 2Q but some intangible signs that things are improving.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks Jeff and then into the second half of the year I think we've enough resources have been put in place to handle, what you're expected to see in terms of volume growth?","JeffSonger","Yes, for us again as I say if you look at our headcount it outpaced volume we generally like that to go the other way but because of congestion, as volume has pressure those assets are here. So I mean the Q1 impact was that expenses are a little elevated but the second half of the year impact should be there we've got adequate resources to handle these opportunities we certainly to plastics continue to look a lot at cross-border refined products opportunities and then the Canadian crude has been mentioned. So with kind of the slowdown in the coal that line for us Kansas City to go to Southeast has plenty of capacity, we got adequate resources from a crude base to where if and when as much as that crude wants to start flowing into the Gulf we\\re ready to handle it.","Operator","Thank you. At this there are no further questions. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Mr. Upchurch for closing comments.","Mike Upchurch","Okay, thank you. Appreciate everyone joining us on the first quarter call. Look forward to talking to you in July about second quarter and of course all of our thoughts and prayers go out to Pat and his family. Thank you very much for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the KCS first quarter earnings call.","On Slide 4, you can see our presenters most of the names here are familiar to you. We're introducing a new voice on the call this morning, Sameh Fahmy, our EVP of Precision Scheduled Railroading is going to make some comments about our progress on the PSR implementation and will be available for questions and Brian Hancock and Jos\u00e9 Zozaya are also on the call and will be available for questions later.","Moving to Slide 5, first quarter overview revenues increased 6% versus last year. Four of our six major business units were up. Mike Naatz will go through those in greater detail but the leaders from our revenue side were Energy Reform related which is refined products moving from U.S. Gulf Coast into Mexico and in Grain. Our volumes were down 1%, a big factor there in the quarter was the blockages that we experienced in the southern part of our network particularly on intermodal between L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and Mexico City.","For operating ratio and earnings per share, we obviously have to report the reported figures, but I draw your attention more to the adjusted figures as they represent more of the sustainable performance metrics that we experienced in the quarter and that we see going forward, so adjusted operating ratio of 64.2% which was 160 basis points better than the first quarter of last year, and earnings per share of $1.54 which was 18% above first quarter of 2018.","Moving onto Slide 6, showing you the outlook. Pretty much the same as we showed you in the fourth quarter with the exception of volume growth which we have taken down by a percent from 3% to 4% which we showed you in January to 2% to 3%. At this moment, although revenue growth has been unchanged, and again, a big part of that story is the loss of intermodal volume in the first quarter which obviously has a bigger impact on volume than it does on revenue but operating ratio, EPS, and CapEx guidance is completely unchanged from what we reported in January.","On Slide 7, I want to show you our PSR ideology or strategy so to speak and I'm not going to read through this but the key points here for Kansas City Southern our PSR strategy is driven by service and growth. You heard us talk about in the fourth quarter January call, and really going back to the third quarter, how we didn't feel good about our performance. We didn't meet our own expectations. We didn't meet our customers or shareholders expectations and that was largely because of the fact that there was business available for us to move that we couldn't move because of service issues that we're experiencing particularly around the border between U.S. and Mexico.","So for us PSR is all about improving the consistency, reliability, and resiliency of our network and it's really focused on service and growth. And I think you'll see as we go through the presentation here with my colleagues, our service has greatly improved, our growth profile has improved, our outlook is the same as it has been. We think there's tremendous opportunity for growth in several areas that we'll talk about, Mike Naatz will talk about it in a minute and if we can get the service issues resolved, improve the consistency, reliability, and resiliency of our network, we can get back on that rapid growth profile that we know is there for us.","Our mantra at the bottom of this slide Service Begets Growth. My team is tired of me saying that and I believe that's really what we're trying to accomplish here with the implementation of certain elements of PSR.","So with that, I will turn the presentation over to you Jeff Songer.","Jeff Songer","Okay, thanks, Pat, and good morning.","Starting with the review of key operating metrics for the quarter on Slide 9, dwell of 21.8 hours improved 5% year-over-year and 16% sequentially, while gross velocity of 12.6 miles per hour improved 11% year-over-year and 13% sequentially.","Numerous factors are contributing to the overall service improvement: PSR initiatives, reduced inventories, execution at our key terminals, and improved asset utilization are all having positive impacts. Specific areas of improvement include our border terminals, Monterrey, Sanchez, and Laredo, all showing marked improvement both sequentially and year-over-year.","Monterrey Yard is one example where we have been able to work constructively with local customers to reduce excess equipment. We've been able to maintain inventory levels of around 1,500 cars this quarter which is about 40% lower than peak levels we saw during last year's congestion.","Another area that continues to improve is the efficiency of processing trains at the Laredo Gateway. Cross-border traffic continues to show substantial growth with volumes up 13% versus Q1 2018 and up almost 25% versus Q1 2017. This illustrates that long-term initiatives including the Sanchez Yard expansion, international crews, and customs process improvements are providing the extended benefit of adding additional capacity at the Laredo Gateway.","Today we cross an average of six to eight trains per day using international crews which can save up to 20 minutes per train.","One other item of note is the change in our reported velocity metric. We will begin reporting a gross velocity number which is a more simplified and relative measure of train performance as it is calculated as the sum of total miles traveled divided by total transit hours. This metric includes all delays including crew changes, terminal dwell, and incidents. Similar to how other PSR railroads report velocity, we feel to focus on a metric that is inclusive of all delays will allow us to better identify and eliminate those sources of delays.","Expanding upon key metrics, we are now using to measure PSR performance on Slide 10; you will see we have added a few metrics for 2019. Train length will be a renewed area of focus as we continue to modify our TSP and reduce train starts. Our stated goal of 6,000 feet for 2019 reflects a 3% growth in overall train length. However we believe we have significant opportunity increasing the size of our manifest and intermodal trains and are targeting a 10% increase in the total combined length of these trains. As we identify additional opportunities for train consolidation, we will modify our targeted train length accordingly.","Car miles per day is another metric used extensively by PSR railroads and measures car velocity instead of total train speed. This measurement will help us establish targets for terminals and road operations to identify other sources of delays and to reduce handlings and work events at a car level.","Fuel efficiency remains an area of focus and we plan to install fuel optimization technology on an additional 100 units this year. As discussed in prior quarters, our fleet renewal strategy is well underway and we have received 25 of the 50 new locomotives planned for this year. These units will contribute to fuel savings through improved fuel efficiency as well as improving our overall fleet reliability that in turn has allowed us to remove a greater number of units from service.","Going forward, we will continue to provide updates on some of these new metrics to illustrate our progress in these areas.","I will now turn the presentation over to Sameh to provide more detail on our overall PSR efforts.","Sameh Fahmy","Thank you, Jeff. Good morning.","So I'll cover a bit what we have done so far on PSR and what we see coming up. As Jeff mentioned, the velocity of the network has increased by 11% and the dwell decreased by 5% which is good news for our customers and it frees up our assets.","When people think of PSR, they typically think of train consolidations, scheduling with customers, locking at origin. In other words service design. But there is also an execution aspect and a discipline that comes with PSR which is the intensity of watching the assets, checking every train delay, and understanding what's going on at least a couple of times every day and that should proceed any service design changes as well as follow every service design change to make sure that it did what it was supposed to do. That intensity has definitely increased substantially in the last three months.","I have some examples here, yard inventories as an example. And Jeff touched on that, Monterrey Yard which is one of the most critical yards on KCS. When I visited that yard, the first time in December, I could not see any tracks. That's how full the yard was. Now full could be an indication of good business but it also means congestion and it means that you cannot switch cars and the dwell increases. So a lot of actions have been taken on that and Jeff mentioned that it has been reduced by about 40%. So we took out about 1,000 cars out of that yard. Yard operations in general is also something that needs to be watched on a constant basis with PSR as an example. We were watching one morning and a train was delayed by something like 54 hours. Well 24 hours of that was waiting just outside the yard and able to see because the crews ran out of time. Now that should not happen like the trains would have been pulled in the yard. But then after that it spent a couple of hours just setting off a block and picking up a block and that's the kind of stuff that PSR looks at and eventually you can change it to service design.","But as a first step, you increase your intensity and make sure that the execution takes care of these things. There is also very heavy switching in KCS particularly in Mexico and that's frankly because of the number of customers. Monterrey again has like 600 customers around the yard, 150 of them are very active customers, and therefore, the switching part of PSR and the service design possibilities and potential are tremendous because one of the things PSR does is to try to block as much as possible at origin and try to also work with the customers to minimize the number of switches.","Something else that we have been focused on which is difficult also at PSR railroads is failures, particularly locomotive failures, which have decreased from about seven per day to four per day. These failures cause a lot of train delays like about 35 hours per day which is substantial for our size of railroad and that's an area that would continue to address.","The Houston area is another very important portion of KCS, and it's actually an area that is increasing in importance now with the refined products business which is a very good business for us. But also all the trains, green trains as an example and manifest trains that come from the U.S. and go to Mexico that goes through that area.","I spent three days with the VP of Transportation, Steve Truitt in Houston and I talked to our partners of other railroads to see how we can improve the fluidity of Houston. Houston is becoming a bit like Chicago and improvement in velocity in that area can significantly improve the velocity of our whole network and obviously the impact of that on our customers and our service as well as on our assets.","So far we have -- we have completed way beyond the execution I'm going now to service design changes that are a way of implementing what we see in execution in a more permanent basis. We have implemented already three major service design changes. You know example combined we had trains that go for one railroad partner, the interchange traffic, another one for KCS, and they all started from St. Louis Porsche and they go up north. So why not combine them. As far north as you can go and then split the traffic but then mix it also with the manifest traffic, so you get intermodal and manifest.","Some trains that are working maybe from L\u00e1zaro to Mexico City that will do a lot of work. Every one of them why get every one of them to do a lot of work when you can divide those that work between trains and get better and faster service point-to-point from L\u00e1zaro to Mexico City on the ones that will not do the work.","We implemented yesterday southbound consolidations from the U.S. to Mexico and now we have set new priorities for our service design team based on what we are seeing in execution particularly as an example the Houston area. So when you have pinch points where the grid is very tight and the capacity is limited, one of the things you want to do is to reduce the number of trains as much as possible. So you consolidate and you combine trains because the openings, the slots for every train are limited. So when you get one, you want to get the most out of it and essentially double the impact if you have two trains in one. The same philosophy obviously applies to the bridge between the U.S. and Mexico.","Something also we have done which goes beyond the internal of KCS is also work with other railroads. People have rather a lot of documents saying well KCS is an interchange railroad, the PSR model does not apply to it. Well first of all it applies big time in Mexico on its own but also in the U.S. we are fortunate that other railroads are actually implementing PSR at the same time as we do and these railroads have been actually asking us if we can combine automotive with manifest traffic for them coming from Mexico and we are asking for reciprocity from them on traffic coming from the U.S. going to Mexico. But also we are beginning to do reciprocal walking meaning we blocked the traffic for less for destinations on that railroad and they blocked traffic coming from them to us for destinations in Mexico. So there is a lot of synergy and again we're very, very fortunate that we're both doing this at the same time.","We are also beginning to look at shorter routes around the Houston area working to get out of the congestion and everybody wins in this case. As a result of this, we have a 100 crew stocks per week that have reduced 100 less locomotives to 1,000 less cars and a 4% improvement in fuel efficiency that comes with the network fluidity.","When we took the assets out, we also took the assets in a way that it takes out the least reliable assets and this is something by the way that all the PSR railroads did but for some reason, it's not talked about enough. You can take out 10% of locomotives which we did here, 100 out of roughly 1,000 but it does a disproportionate impact on your reliability because you take out locomotives at eight, nine times a year that really you are better off not to even have them. So you improve the fluidity of the network velocity but also you reduce the work in the shops because you have a lot less repairs. And we actually did close one of the locomotive shops and we also decided to enforce another locomotive shop because we want to be the beneficiaries of the improvements of PSR that we are doing. We don't want to be bound by contracts and that shop alone closing it is going to save KCS $4 million a year.","So overall it's a very, very good chemistry. The team is a fantastic team. There is commitment; there is enthusiasm, but at a very high level of energy, it's very similar to the level of energy I've seen on two other railroads I have associated with that implemented PSR and that really bodes well and if we have all the signs of a winning team, I can name, I can go on that a long list. But we have people like Mike Vilsack, Olivia Daily, Cary Tippins, Steve Truitt, Brent Vander Ark, and Jon Meyers, who and that's only to name a few we have fantastic team.","So now I turn it to Mike Naatz.","Mike Naatz","Hey, thank you, Sameh, and good morning everyone.","I'd like to start my comments on Page 14, where you will notice that revenues were up 6% year-over-year. I'm happy to say this is a record first quarter for KCS despite the headwinds from the Teacher protests in the State of Michigan.","If you look at the chart, please note that the service interruptions caused by those Teacher protests impacted by and across several business units including our intermodal, automotive, and industrial consumer segment.","For the quarter, our cross-border revenue was up 18% and a 13% increase in volume. We continue to see strong growth from our refined products and our cross-border intermodal business. And in addition, we saw an increase in our cross-border grain volumes. This was due in a large part to the improved network fluidity and cycle times that were mentioned earlier. I like this because this supports the idea that service does beget growth.","During the quarter, our revenue per unit grew at about 7% driven largely by a shift in business mix from the lower revenue per unit intermodal volumes over to the higher revenue per unit chemical and petroleum business. The latter grew at 21% due to the continued benefits from Mexico Energy Reform.","Our intermodal segment decreased in revenues and volumes by 12% and 9% respectively. The deterioration in volume was primarily the result of the Teacher protests in the State of Michigan as well as the extended automotive plant shutdowns that occurred earlier in the year. On the plus side, our intermodal cross-border franchise volumes grew at 5%. This was driven by truck to rail conversions. This growth was partially offset by a slightly shorter length of haul.","In the U.S., we are seeing some softness in the domestic intermodal market and this seems to be driven by increased truck availability. Year-over-year revenue from our industrial and consumer business units was up 2% and 3% lower volumes. The volume declines were primarily attributable to the Michigan service interruption and the unplanned paper plant outages. These declines were partially offset by favorable pricing and mix.","And finally, the utility coal business drove our energy business revenue growth of 5% as we lapse plant closures that impacted us in 2018.","Moving on to Slide 15, we provided an update to our 2019 revenue outlook. As Pat mentioned, we are maintaining our year-over-year revenue guidance of 5% to 7% and Mexican Energy Reform continues to be a significant focus for us and it's definitely unique opportunity that we remain very, very excited about.","We are however revising our volume guidance down 2% to 3%, growth driven in large part by the quarter Teacher protests that we saw in early Q1. Unplanned plant shutdowns in the automotive and paper industries and available truck capacity U.S. will have some downward pressure.","And with that, I'll turn things over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Mike, and good morning everyone.","I'm going to start my comments on Slide 17. Revenues increased 6% on volume decline of 1% and revenue per unit growth of 7%. Reported operating ratio of 76.2% was worse than the 65.8% from the first quarter 2018, primarily reflecting the $67.5 million restructuring charge which represents an impairment of locomotives and freight cars no longer required in our business, employee severance costs, and contract restructuring costs.","Additionally, due to a change in Mexican Tax Law, the fuel tax credit has been moved from an offset in operating expense to a credit in income taxes and I'll provide more details on the next slide.","Adjusted operating ratio of 64.2% was 150 or 160 basis points better than the first quarter of 2018, due to revenue growth, initial benefits from PSR implementation, and other expense reductions. I'll provide more colors on PSR in a few slides.","Incremental margins in the quarter were strong 63%. Reported diluted EPS of $1.02 was down 27% from first quarter of 2018. However on an adjusted diluted earnings per share basis, we generated $1.54 which is 18% higher than the adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.30 from the first quarter of 2018. The increase in earnings per share is primarily from higher adjusted operating ratio or operating income that increased 10% along with the lower share count of 2.1 million common shares resulting from stock repurchases.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 28.9% in line with the 29% to 30% guidance we provided in January and I'll provide more detail on our tax rates and we have some Appendix materials in Slide 26.","Turning to Slide 18, before I get started on the changes in our IEPS, I want to maybe just set the tone that there is no difference in our eligibility of obtaining the IEPS credit. There is no difference in the economics of IEPS. It's still a pass-through of what we pay and there's no difference in the full-year GAAP net income or EPS.","So in January of this year, Mexico changed the provisions of tax law that previously allowed for the realization of the IEPS credit as an offset to both withholding taxes and our income tax liability. The new provisions only allow for the realization of the IEPS credit as an offset to our income tax payments. So we can no longer offset against withholding taxes.","Despite the tax credit being a dollar for dollar credit against the excise taxes we pay on fuel expenditures included in our fuel expense, the strictest interpretation of accounting literature requires us to change the geography of the credit from an offset in operating expense to income tax expense. While this change creates undue complexity for investors to understand both the economics of the transaction and the GAAP financial statement impact, we're required to record the fuel credit in income taxes going forward due to the change in law. Pages 23, 24, and 26 in the Appendix provide more information to help investors gain a better understanding of the true economics of the fuel excise tax by providing a reported GAAP to adjusted schedule for various financial statement line items.","And to make this even more complicated previously the tax impact of the IEPS benefit was subject to the 30% statutory tax rate in Mexico. However recording the credit in income tax expense subjects us to income tax accounting principles that require an estimate of the full-year effective tax rate of the IEPS credit and record that in your quarterly tax provision. This GAAP accounting requirement creates $2.9 million or $0.03 benefit in adjusted EPS in 1Q 2019 but we expect that to reverse in quarters two through four. While this required change seems overly complex, it's again important to note that there is no difference in our eligibility of the IEPS credit. There is no difference in the economics of IEPS and there's no difference in our full-year net income or EPS.","Turning to Slide 19, adjusted operating expenses increased 3% well under our revenue increase of 6%. Depreciation, wage, and benefit inflation, increased average headcount and higher repairs and maintenance costs led the year-over-year expense increases. Offsetting those expenses were lower equipment costs from better cycle time performance that lowered car hire expense by $3 million, better fuel efficiency of $2 million, and favorable impacts from foreign currency of $3 million.","And just a quick note on our headcount in the quarter, that's an average headcount that's reported and after considering the in-sourcing of some contractors, our quarter-end FTE was down slightly year-over-year and down slightly from February, end of month February.","And to give you a little bit of guidance for the rest of the year what we expect to see in expenses, we're still looking at comp and benefit up around 5%, purchase services and materials and other give or take inflationary type increases, equipment expense which we previously guided to flat for the year, we now expect to be down mid-single-digit and then depreciation expense which we guided to being up 9% will now be up kind of mid-single-digits.","Turning to the PSR slide during the first quarter of 2019, management took several actions implementing PSR principles that will generate approximately $16 million in OpEx savings in 2019 and $25 million on an annualized basis.","Benefits include lower comp and benefit expense from reducing approximately 100 positions primarily from reduced maintenance activity commensurate with our reduced locomotive fleet and from fewer crew starts as we consolidate trains. We also expect depreciation expense from disposed assets to be lower. We also anticipate lower material costs from the disposal or return of approximately 100 locomotives and approximately 2,000 railcars deemed excess in our owned and leased fleet.","Lastly, we expect benefits from restructuring of maintenance contracts. These actions represent a good start on our efforts to improve customer service, lower costs, and improve asset efficiency. However it is important to note that these cost reductions only partially help us achieve our own aggressive goals for 2019.","In addition to those cost reductions, we saw expense reductions in the quarter from lower car hire expense and improved fuel efficiency, partially as a result of implementing PSR principles that have improved our velocity, dwell, and asset efficiency. Our fuel efficiency is also benefiting from our prior investment in trip optimizer and other fuel saving technologies and initiatives. And it's important to note that we moved 2% more GTMs in the quarter and burned 2% fewer gallons.","As we continue to firm up our PSR plans during the second quarter, you can expect us to target incremental savings as we further rationalize the equipment fleet, reduce train starts, and implement other cost savings initiatives.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Pat.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay thanks Mike. I have a couple of quick comments before we open the call for a Q&A.","I want to go back again to draw your attention to Slide 7 and just reiterate that our focus and our strategy with respect to implementing PSR is really led by service and growth. This slide as my team here knows is we put lot of thought into this message. This is one message for all audiences. So this is the approach that we're taking with respect to PSR implementation that we will communicate to shareholders, analysts, customers, employees, regulators one message for all audiences.","And I want to share an email exchange here from late yesterday. I was having an email conversation with our largest cross-border shipper and closed my last email with the comment that we are scheduled to have our first quarter earnings call tomorrow. Wish me luck and I'm just going to read the text of his reply. Good luck, tomorrow. My guess is you guys will be just fine. It's been impressive to see just how well your operations are performing lately.","So I think we're really off to a great start with the implementation and we have experience so far clearing congestion from our network, from our yards, getting out of our own way so that we can improve the consistency, reliability, and resiliency of our network and put ourselves in a position where we can take advantage of the really powerful growth opportunities that we have in the years ahead.","So I know you all have really found my guidance on headlines for the quarter very helpful in the past. So I think the way I think this quarter strong beat, strong performance, and more importantly PSR has cleared the path for exceptional growth going forward.","With that, I will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","The first question will come from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry","Good morning, thank you. If I just think about the sort of sequence of events in prior PSR iterations, it seems like you're sort of changing the train design, service design, and it goes on with yard rationalization and all of that. But just given the fact that you guys have a lot of growth in front of you, is there any change in the way that PSR will get implemented such that you can continue to take on that volume growth, maybe if you could explain that a little bit more, and, Sameh, if you have any thoughts just given your experience with past implementation?","Sameh Fahmy","Yes, I mean you mentioned yards as an example. Our approach is not -- is not going to be to close yards unless something really is obvious, but I doubt it. When we free up space in yards and reduce switching and reduce dwell, it's actually more to be able to absorb more business and to service our customers in a more reliable manner and we're working very, very close to many customers. Monterrey again comes as a very good example to coordinate between what we call local jobs spotting cars and picking up cars from them and coordinating with the capacity that they have on their tracks and giving them the best possible service and most consistent service.","So we are not going to look at this and we don't have hump yards as an example, okay. So this is hump yards are nothing but a huge sorting machine and because PSR principle is to reduce the number of times you touch a car then you eliminate some of the need for these sorting machines. But we don't have hump yards. Okay, we have measure yards that have flat switching. So we're what using that principle of reducing the number of times we touch a car more to reduce the switching. But like I said to free up space and grow our volume. Something really distinct here and Pat mentioned it a couple of times is that the volumes here are growing. It's a nice -- it's a nice potential particularly in Mexico in which case the capacity that is freed up will be used. I don't know if I answered the question correctly.","Allison Landry","Yes. That was really good color. And then as my second question non PSR related but could you guys maybe split out from the yield perspective, how much price versus mix versus fuel contributed?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, Allison this is Mike. I think from a pricing perspective we saw increases during the quarter along with renewal rates in the quarter that were similar to what we saw in 2018. The big impact obviously was the drop in intermodal which is about a third of our PU when you compare it against the entire book of business. And then of course we had great growth in refined products which has a relatively high revenue per car load. So I think we'll leave it at that.","Operator","The next question will come from Jason Seidl of Cowen.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Good morning guys. Couple of quick questions. I think you said the adjustment in the volume outlook was -- was it entirely due to the first quarter weakness on the intermodal side or is there anything else behind?","Mike Naatz","So weakness was associated with intermodal industrial consumer and the automotive business. All three of those business segments were impacted by the Teacher strike in the State of Michigan. So it's important [indiscernible] --","Pat Ottensmeyer","Larger in the first quarter. I will pass to Jason.","Jason Seidl","Yes that was going to be my next question and the other thing just to clarify something, when I'm looking at your cross-border intermodal volumes versus revenue, I mean your intermodal volumes are up 5% but your revenues are down 6%, it seems to be some sort of a mix shift going on. Can you elaborate on that?","Mike Naatz","Yes, we've had a reduction in our length of haul which is largely driving the discrepancy that you're referring to.","Jason Seidl","Would revenues have been up if you exclude the length of haul?","Mike Naatz","Revenues would have improved if we would have excluded the length of haul. The length of haul that's most significant to us is the East St. Louis moving south. That business went away as a result of activities on another railroad and as a result that significantly reduced our length of haul on the domestic products.","Jason Seidl","Perfect, those are my two. Thank you again. Appreciate the time.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Your next question will come from Justin Long of Stephens.","Justin Long","So, Sameh, maybe to start with a question for you on PSR. I wanted to see if I could get your thoughts on how you would compare the margin potential from PSR in the U.S. versus Mexico just given the different dynamics of those networks and the different labor dynamics as well?","Sameh Fahmy","We have been looking at the whole network as a whole. We and because it frankly affects each other like I talked extensively about the Houston area as an example and that is for traffic going south from the U.S. to Mexico and traffic going Northbound from Mexico to the U.S. So we have not -- we have not looked at segmenting our efforts on PSR between the U.S. and Mexico. We have been looking at it as a whole.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Justin, I'll -- this is Pat. I'll chime in here to just add a little bit of additional color to this and I give an example kind of -- we have this question a lot. We really -- we really don't pay attention to Mexico versus U.S. operating ratio. We look at the combined network, as you know, 40% of our traffic is cross-border and on a co-story going back to the Dave Sterling era shortly after Dave arrived at KCS, he was getting involved in making some operating changes decisions and one of the decisions that he made was to shift some switching activity from Laredo Texas to Nuevo Laredo in Mexico.","And the senior operating guy who is no longer here wasn't here very long after this conversation in fact made a comment and said well we can't do that. That will increase our operating ratio. Dave pretty much cut him off and said what do you mean our operating ratio and I mean I was talking about the Mexico operating ratio. So we definitely had that mentality in the company either 10 years ago. And, as Sameh said, we are -- as we're implementing PSR, we're looking at just making decisions what's the right way to handle the traffic. Where should we, where do we have capacity, where do we have resources. And that's going to drive costs in decisions about where we handle things that may affect the operating ratio in Mexico versus the U.S.","And the way we run the network whether it's on the cost side, the revenue side is very much just ignoring the details of what the impact is going to be on operating ratio in Mexico versus U.S. and doing what's right for the network, what\u2019s right for the customer. It's almost like if you would ask Union Pacific or BN, what is your operating ratio in Illinois versus Iowa, it's just not a factor.","Justin Long","It makes sense. And secondly I guess this one's for Mike. So it sounds like your outlook for headcount has improved year-to-date but you mentioned that the guidance for comp and benefits to be up 5% was unchanged from what you told us in January. Can you give us some more color on why that's the case and why that's not moving lower? And then also on the change in the accounting for the fuel excise tax credit, is that going to impact incentive comp at all?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, Justin, on comp and benefits, we had guided up around 5% back on our January call. We did in our plans assume a gradual decline in headcount throughout the course of the year and we continue to expect that. We talked this morning about 100 reduction in positions. There's some mix issues there between the two countries that maybe don't give you quite the dollar impact. So we're going to stick for right now with up about 5%.","With respect to the fuel tax credit really nothing has changed on the fuel tax credit from either a net income EPS perspective or the fact that we're eligible to get the credit. So there's really no anticipated change all that happened here was because of law change, we were no longer able to offset this against withholding taxes. And we can only offset it against income taxes and that drove us down into income taxes so no change there.","Operator","Next question will come from Ari Rosa of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Hey it's Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Hey guys really interesting in the depth you have engaged in Precision Railroading. So thanks for that. But, Sameh, your thoughts on interlining Wichita rails. How important is your performance become and your ability to improve on PSR and keeping to your schedule given the amount of interline traffic you have?","Sameh Fahmy","Like I explained earlier, we are definitely in this game together with major class ones. I can think particularly a few people who is our largest partner and BNSF. And when they do have impacts example recently the floods, it did have some impact on us. But the resiliency aspect that Pat mentioned really comes out in this case is that situations like this that ended up not only affecting us at the North end of our network but they started rippling into the Southwest of the U.S. like Texas. If we had not had PSR, we would have had some serious congestion issues and some disruptions like it happened last October.","It was, it's very similar. The circumstances were very similar but because of all the implementations of PSR, we actually absorbed the blow and maintained a very decent velocity and a very decent service to our customers. Not only the PSR changes that we made internally but also the very, very close tight work that we have been doing with these other partners who in the case of one of them is also migrating to PSR. So yes, the interline is very important but the synchronization between the railroads is important and working together in a very synergetic manner as well as implementing within KCS the PSR principles to create that resiliency that I talked about.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Chris Wetherbee","It is on a few one of those. Sameh, maybe another question for you. Just when you think about the network relative to the other two rails that you've been at you obviously have really strong strides forward particularly from the Houston guide now, wanted to get a sense of maybe how you sort of compare this at least potential from an operating ratio perspective to those businesses? And then just maybe a little bit of a follow-up on what your expectations are for timing of the rollout and is your contracts around a two-year deal. You think this can all be achieved in a relatively short timeframe or how should we actually be thinking about that?","Sameh Fahmy","We gave a guidance on the operating ratio. Mike talked about it and Pat of 61% to 62% by 2021. Clearly if 60% to 61% I'm sorry 60% to 61% by 2021. Now we have clearly made very good progress, very fast in Q1. How is that going to impact the timeline, I guess we'll find out as the months go by.","But now if I compare this to other railroads which was at the front-end of your question, all I can say is that I look at the active trains twice a day and we have a report that comes out that shows all the delays and event by event and a one of the delays are enduring. And all I can say is that we have a lot of room to go. Okay like we have, we clearly have a lot of potential. If I look at the train delays, we know -- we know what are the pinch points are, we know what's causing these delays. We know what needs to be done. It's a question now of converting but that is still a lot of -- that is frankly still a lot of fruits hanging. And I guess that's --","Pat Ottensmeyer","And Chris I just go back to the comment that you remember what we said at the end of the fourth quarter and full-year 2018 performance. None of us felt good about the way we performed in 2018. And we knew that we left a lot of business behind because we -- our service was not at a level that allowed us to handle all the business that we knew was available. So our focus here, there's going to be operating ratio improvement as a result of changing the way we manage and operate the network. But again it's really about primarily focused on service and growth.","If we can get our service improved, we can improve the resiliency of our network. We know there's business for us to handle and that ultimately is going to be a powerful driver of improvement in operating ratio, improvement and EPS, and ultimately improvement in shareholder returns.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, that's helpful. And one quick follow-up to sneak it in for Mike here. In terms of charges, anything else we should be expecting as this year progresses, as you guys continue looking towards PSR?","Mike Upchurch","Well, I mean we're still developing our plans and that that certainly could be the case here in the second or third quarter, we will kind of monitor that and provide some timely updates at various points throughout the conference season and you should certainly expect an update from us on our progress and our targets during the second quarter and we'll probably do that on the second quarter earnings call.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks, operator. Hi everybody thanks for taking the question. Mike just quickly on the tax credit reclassification. I just want to confirm that the way you report the adjusted cost base in the adjusted OR has not changed in the quarter and how will you report the cost base going forward. And I think the 60% to 61% OR included the tax credit above the lines. So I'm just trying to compare the performance you achieved in the quarter in terms of how you're going to report numbers and the target make sure all those are in apples-to-apples basis from an EBIT perspective?","Mike Upchurch","Yes. So good question and we did actually include a slide in the Appendix that I think gives you the various amounts and the geography of where they're reported and where we adjusted them. So hopefully that will help and I'd be happy to have a call with you after the official earnings call is over here to provide any more guidance on that.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. But I mean is the 60% and 61% OR excluding this credit above the line or excluding the credit above the line?","Mike Upchurch","That's -- you should view that as an adjusted OR for us going forward.","Amit Mehrotra","Great, okay, got it. And then one other question if I could there's obviously been a lot of headlines in recent weeks about the Mexican government engaging the anti-trust commission to discuss competitiveness of the rail network. I know you provided a statement inter quarter which was very, very helpful. But any other color that you can help with in terms of what's going on, on the ground because there's just been a resurgence of headlines and activity around that topic from 12 months ago. And obviously it has fundamental implications for the outlook for the company. So any color on what's actually going on in the ground would be helpful?","Mike Upchurch","Sure. First thing I'd mention is this wasn't entirely unexpected. We knew this investigation was going on. I think we made some comments about that. And the specific impact the commodities, the routes, the business that is the target of the most recent Coface ruling is less than 1% or 2% of our total business.","And we actually think this is a good thing and I will explain that in a minute. If you remember a couple of years ago Coface and there was a push in the Mexican Congress to more broadly reregulate open competition on the railroad networks by suggesting or imposing trackage rights on a much broader basis. And when we argued and we opposed that point of view by saying really if you think about making a determination that there is a lack of effective competition, this really has to be commodity and route specific. This most recent ruling is commodity and route specific that I think there are 31 or 32 specific routes. All of them -- all of them are routes that are originated by another railroad other than KCS.","This is primarily focused on the shipment of chemicals from quarts of cocoas which we do not have direct access to into other markets in Mexico. So we are responding to the ruling. We expect the Coface final ruling to be public in the fall late summer or fall and then the process will the way the process works that ruling once it's final and determined will be passed to the ATRF which is the call it the Mexican SPB it's the regulatory agency in Mexico that has responsibility for remedies and enforcement.","And then we're in a new world. There's no case history, there's no precedent for how the ATRF is going to rule once they get the final Coface ruling. We will be very engaged in that process. We have a ATRF commissioner who's new with the current -- with the new Lopez Obrador administration. I met with him last week in Mexico City. We will be very engaged. I think they're very reasonable. They understand the importance of creating an atmosphere in the rail industry that that allows the railroad operators and concessionaires to earn an acceptable return on their investments and keep the rail network in Mexico particularly as it relates to connecting to the rest of North America very efficient and attracting capital. So we think we've got a good -- a good regulator in Mexico that will reach a reasonable conclusion but it's probably going to be several quarters or years before we have a final determination.","Amit Mehrotra","Got it. Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you so much.","Mike Upchurch","More than anybody wanted but that's where we are.","Amit Mehrotra","I guess I'll just say gracias. Appreciate it guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Ben Hartford","Hi this is Ben Hartford on for Brandon. A quick question for Sameh, so you touched a little in the interliner question earlier about how some of what you're doing has allowed you to respond to events, you've had some one-time events in the past. Can you just touch a little bit more in detail on the specific service design initiatives that you've implemented and how they'll help you respond to one-time events and make them less cascading moving forward?","Sameh Fahmy","Actually in this case, some of the service design changes helped a little because we have fewer trains running in Mexico due to service design changes but it goes back to my point earlier when I was presenting my slide about the execution portion of PSR. PSR is a philosophy of running the railroad in a scheduled manner. But the key word also is precision and that precision is the execution side and you can get a lot of fruits out of the execution before you even implement any service design changes.","Just the intensity of watching, watching trains constantly and looking at like these reports that we have reports that come out twice a day, they come out like 5 in the morning and 5 PM. I read them actually at 5 AM. And then you react immediately, you don't wait until the situation builds up and you have that huge backlog that is coming from a simple example.","We had a bad, bad storm okay on the weekend. In fact in this case Shreveport to Meridian and there was a big recovery happening the trees that came down on the line and all that. There was a lot of intensity over the weekend some work that was supposed to maybe take place on Monday, it took place on Saturday, and the guys worked and they reopened the line faster and really cover a lot faster.","The thing I talked about on Houston for Texas, we did not wait like we could see that a lot of trains were in holding status. And after cascade them up all the way to the North because we don't have -- we don't have huge yards. So you don't wait until it gets out of hand and out of control. You start attacking it right away. We went to Houston sat in the dispatch center and worked with people and worked with the other railroad and we helped each other and we found solutions like shorter routes outside of the area that not only help us but they help the other railroads because they take us out of that grid and reduce the congestion, so.","And then the coordination between the U.S. side and the Mexican side which was not very -- was not at a 100% in October and this time that coordination was superb like the guys at Sanchez making sure that the way they release trains going northbound, they're going to release them not in a way that congested trains are coming southbound. So that's -- that's what I'm referring to is and I call it focus and intensity and being engaged. And so that allowed us to do these things and work with the interline partners and absorb also any blips that are happening on any side.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","Good morning. Yes, good morning. Let's see a lot of interesting things to talk about on the call and appreciate all the perspective you're providing. Let's see either for I guess Sameh or Pat, I just wanted to get your thought on where you're at in the reset of the train schedules, are you 90% there, are you 50% there. But if you look across the whole network and you think about changing the train schedule how far along are you?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I'm going to ask Jeff Songer to address that question.","Jeff Songer","Yes, I'll comment and I made a comment about our train length initiative and again the 3% initial target is maybe a little underwhelming when you look at the total but our intermodal maintenance product and primarily as we're starting to look at this in Mexico, there is a substantial amount of opportunity with resetting train starts and we're doing that. I think Sameh mentioned we've taken a look at our northbound product that was done earlier in the quarter.","Our Southbound products are just now. I mean just this month we've started to make and implement some changes. So I think I wouldn't put it as a 50%, I would say as part of the intermodal manifest product itself we're certainly working down that path. We have not yet focused on maybe some of the U.S. products with maybe bulk commodities. I don't think there's as much opportunity there but there certainly is opportunity we will be looking at here as this quarter progresses and all through the year.","So I would say we're early -- early in this and early from seeing the benefits here in Q1 and lot of these changes we've already made just came into play here made Q1 and summer just starting right now.","Tom Wadewitz","What was the 3% number again, Jeff that was total [indiscernible]?","Jeff Songer","Yes, in my slide in the presentation there we're regaining focus here on train length. And so if you look at the numbers we provided the overall train length there I think for the charter for this year with what we've identified thus far is about 3%. But I made the color comment around manifest intermodal are biggest opportunities out of the gate here. We're looking for 10%, probably 10-plus-percent growth on those trains.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay that's great. And then just a quick follow-up. A lot of this seems predominantly process driven that's PSR, right. But are there any infrastructure constraints that I think if we look at like what TREE did -- they did some targeted train -- excuse me siding expansions or siding additions. Is there -- is that a component of the opportunity as well to kind of strategically add pieces of infrastructure to make the network flow better?","Jeff Songer","Yes, I'll give my comments and I'll let Sameh add some color here. I mentioned also the cross-border for us that continues to be the catalyst and the main -- and the main driver of this cross-border volume we're seeing both from an infrastructure perspective as we've been doing over the past few years adding the physical capacity of international crews. Those initiatives are not necessarily physical capacity. International crews is proving to have a lot of benefit, continuing work with customs.","On the capacity side because of the refined products opportunity Mike mentioned, we are investing somewhat last year and then heavily this year in our corridor between Houston and Laredo. And so that's going to pick up Houston originated traffic Corpus originated traffic. So we've seen this coming. We've reacted, we constructed one new siding last year, we've got a couple of new sidings, we're constructing right now to stay ahead of that. So I think strategically in the quarters that are really growing for us, we are looking to add capacity in some segments.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Hey Tom, I will provide a little cover here to your question and that is we talked a lot here as we as make these changes, as we implement these things as we take locomotives, cars, service design the changes that we're making kind of we're -- if we're going to air, we're going to air on the side of probably moving a little slower than quickly.","One thing we've talked about here we never want to be in the position that we were in last year where we said to investors, shareholders, employees, board there was more business that we could handle than we were able to handle because of congestion and service issues on the network. I never want to have to come back on an earnings call and say there was more business than we could handle but we couldn't take any and we couldn't move it because of a lack of power or crews or other assets. So we're going to be very careful and thoughtful as we make these changes with an eye toward making sure that we have capacity to handle the business that we believe we know is available to us particularly in the four oversized growth areas that we see ahead of us refined products, plastics, automotive, and intermodal.","Sameh Fahmy","And if I may add to what Jeff said about some of the improvements in infrastructure. As we keep looking at yards everyday and we have a small team that has been going through yards. There are some small, small money investments that pay huge dividends example we have a yard at Vannes in Mexico and the main line goes right in the middle of the yard. So whenever you do switching you lock the main line. But we can do some bypasses here for $1 million, $2 million and in fluidity, we have a situation at a place called Leon which is north of Monterrey which is a true change point. And every train whether it\u2019s southbound or northbound goes through that location and spends about 4, 4.5 hours not only to change crews but to add locomotive because when it goes out that are great. When we are doing that, we are also blocking the main line. So if you built the track to do this work then you can -- you can save a lot of time.","So there are a lot of small infrastructure savings that can be done that can greatly improve the fluidity particularly of yards but also on the main line I just described especially that Beaumont all the way to Laredo section.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group","Hey thanks. Thanks good morning guys. So 100 locos, 2,000 cars so far. I guess how much more in the pipeline in the next couple of years. And then my big picture, I think last quarter you said the OR improvement the next three years is maybe a little bit more back-end loaded with lower D&A and equipment cost this year. Does that change now? Is 2019 now better than you thought from an OR standpoint or there any offsets we need to think about?","Jeff Songer","Yes, Scott I'll take the first part of that question and then ask Pat to answer the second part. And again I don't -- I hate to say I don't know how much more and go back to what I said a minute ago. We're going to be very thoughtful about how we take assets, locomotives, crews, cars out of the picture here because we want to do this in a way that is long-term sustainable and we want to do this in a way that prevents us from ever having to say there was more business than we -- that we had available that we could handle because of a shortage of resources.","I think there's more to come but -- and we'll every day we're finding opportunities to reduce congestion, reduce assets, do more with less and the quarter-end is an opportunity for us to take a still shot of where we are and report to analysts and shareholders and we'll continue to update quarterly, if we have information during the -- between the quarter reports at conferences and other venues we'll update the market. But we're just going to go about this every day finding opportunities to get better and improve our performance.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Scott and to address your other question, you're right. The 60% to 61% we did guide is a bit more back-loaded. Remember that was primarily because of a big step up in PTC costs from 2018 to 2019 approximately $17 million.","The other factor just to keep in mind while we are seeing a nice downward reduction in our expenses we have one quarter that doesn't make for the full-year. And finally on the slide that I reviewed where we showed $16 million of 2019 operating expense savings don't forget the comment I made that that only partly gets us to the goals that we established for 2019. So we're really pleased with our results in the first quarter. But we've got a lot of work ahead of us.","Operator","The next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna.","Bascome Majors","Yes, thanks for taking my question here. I just want to follow-up on Justin's earlier question for Sameh and Pat and asking I know from that response in what you said before you don't manage the business to independently maximize margins on either side of border. But even with all the challenges you had South of the border last year, it still looks like the Mexico business operated at what's called a high 50s OR versus for the full-year versus the U.S. business in the high 60s. So as you think about implementing the PSR principles that worked for your network is there anything structurally keeping takes this U.S. business from getting into let's call it somewhere in the 50s much longer term and given the corollary that we saw the Illinois Central reached the low 60s more than 20 years ago with the North South U.S. Railroad. Thanks.","Pat Ottensmeyer","I'm going to take that one and I'm going to be really stubborn about my answer. It's just really, is unimportant to us. We look at the combined results and we will make decisions about cost, activity others things that are in a particularly given the 40% of our business that is cross-border, that is in the interest of driving consolidated profitability and improvement in performance and really very little regard to U.S. versus Mexico operating ratio. So I know that's probably not a satisfying answer but I'm going to be really stubborn about that.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck of J.P. Morgan.","Brian Ossenbeck","Two quick questions here. One if Mike or Mike if you can give us an update on just what's going on at the border there's obviously been some disruption with some order personnel being reassigned. I know that's been a near-term disruption to the business if it's not opportunity if trucks could [indiscernible] us longer so maybe can just cover that? And then third for Sameh if you can just -- it's not though a lot of success the opportunities with PSR at KCS? Can you just give us a sense of some of the challenges and difficulties you are encountering, what's the easier or tougher than you've expected so far this year earlier in the process? Thank you.","Mike Naatz","I will take the first piece. I believe that you're referring to the long lines of trucks at the borders that are waiting to cross as a result of some personnel movement with the CBP; is that correct?","Brian Ossenbeck","Yes, that's correct, Mike.","Mike Naatz","Okay. So, yes, we absolutely do see that and we're not experiencing any challenges like that on the railroad side of the house. I believe it's much more efficient and effective to cross similar amounts of volume via train versus via truck. And I'd like to see this turn into an opportunity for us absolutely.","Brian Ossenbeck","Is it too early for that opportunity to arise?","Mike Naatz","We have had customers approach us looking for alternatives of moving freight across the border trying to move away from truck and move to trains. So those discussions are happening but there's a fair amount of work that will need to be done in order to make the actual change occur.","Sameh Fahmy","Now as far as the second part of your question about challenges, I guess the biggest challenge is the Houston area. Like when it comes to -- when it comes to Mexico and all that it's all great potential. The rest of the U.S. is also great potential.","The one challenge is the Houston area. But it's a nice challenge to have because it is something that has been hindering KCS for a long, long time. So fixing that is going to be a step function improvement to the whole -- to the whole network. So I think that the same way as it's a channel, it's just a golden opportunity and we're working very, very hard to find solutions for it. Some of the solutions are short-term, some of the solutions are more medium-term like infrastructure improvements joint efforts with other railroads.","As far as another saying that obviously is always something that you don't know until you start date or size up PSR when you joined a new team is you don't know what kind of receptivity, what kind of engagement and that was a fantastic surprise like that was extremely positive that the team here is, is definitely, definitely very committed and you see it -- you see it, when you send somebody a note on a Saturday morning and they reply within five minutes that tells you that people are watching, they are fully engaged in this process and they all want -- it's a winning team and it's a very positive spirit you feel it and the chemistry is awesome.","You don't find anybody questioning or hesitant or second guessing or saying okay well now this is because of PSR assumption. It's -- you don't see any of that and that's -- so that is on the very positive surprise side. And like I said on the challenge Houston is hit and I'm confident that we'll fix this.","Jeff Songer","Unrelated to this question, Pat, if I can just clarify something I mentioned earlier. There was a question about intermodal revenue per unit decreases and I correctly referred to the fact that that was a result of the change of length of haul. And the example that I provided with St. Louis was correct or if I mistakenly refer to that as U.S. domestic business and it's actually U.S. cross-border business. I just wanted to make sure I clarified that.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay, I think we're finished. Operator, no further questions?","Operator","No, that\u2019s all at this time.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Well I will pick up on the closing comment from Sameh. I know there are a lot of KCS employees, if you'll indulge me for just a few seconds here. Lot of KCS employees listened to this call both in the U.S. and Mexico. And I just want to pick up on what Sameh closed with and that is just the level of engagement and commitment and enthusiasm that I've seen and I think the whole team have seen. Go back to the end of the year when we talked about the performance in 2018 not being up to our own expectations I really feel like everybody in the company felt that way and the way this team has engaged is, is just been very, very gratifying. Everybody in this company wants to get better. We know we didn't meet our customers' expectations, our shareholders expectations, our own expectations in 2018.","So I just want to make that comment for the people on the call from KCS. I'm very pleased, very proud of the effort, the engagement, the commitments that this team has shown. So I think there are many good, good things ahead of us and I'll close with that and we'll catch up at conferences in about three months with our second quarter report. Thank you all very much.","Operator","Thank you. This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day."],"12509":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call June 20, 2018  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Patrick Ottensmeyer - President and Chief Executive Officer","Jeffrey Songer - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Brian Hancock - Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer","Michael Upchurch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya - President and Executive Representative of KCSM","Analysts","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Jason Seidl - Cowen and Company","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Ravi Shanker - Morgan Stanley","Matthew Reustle - Goldman Sachs","Christian Wetherbee - Citi","Justin Long - Stephens Inc","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Brian Ossenbeck - J.P.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.","[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company which could materially differ from the events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP could be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, you may now begin. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thank you very much and good morning everyone and welcome to the KCS second quarter earnings call. I will start my comments with just brief introduction on slide four, but you all know the casp and line up for our call no call changes, so I won\u2019t spend anytime introducing us.","Slide five, just a couple of quick comments about the results, we had record quarterly revenues for the second quarter of 2018, revenues up by 4% from the previous year, volumes up only 1% which was a bit of and disappointment and I will talk about that in and couple of minutes. ","Operating ratio of 64.0% which was 50 basis points higher than last year, Mike Upchurch will review this in greater detail in a few minutes, but volume weakness higher casualty and fuel expense and PTC related cost including depreciation were some of the major contributors to the higher operating ratio. ","We also produce record quarterly earnings per share, there were some tax items included in that number, but and as Mike will review in a few minutes as well. But I would still say solid earnings per share growth for the quarter. ","Before I turn the discussion over to the team, I would like to make one additional comment on our volume growth and full-year outlook. Given our actual volume growth for the quarter and year-to-date to six months, we are revising our guidance which are previously been mid single-digit down a bit, while it\u2019s a certainly no means out of the question that we could still achieve mid single-digit volume growth for the full-year. At this point there is certainly greater risk and higher probability that will come in below that guidance. ","So, our current expectation is that full-year volume growth will be in a range of 3% to 4% which is kind of right at the edge of high, or low to mid single-digit growth. I think for the past few weeks, Mike Upchurch and the Investors Relations team have been guiding to the lower end of our previous guidance range. So, hopefully this doesn\u2019t come as a surprise to most of you on the call. ","As Brian Hancock will show you in a few minutes there is a lot of strength in many of our most important long-term growth areas and while the major areas of disappointment was crude oil, which was largely a timing issue. And again Brian will talk more about that in a few minutes. ","So with that introduction, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer.","Jeffrey Songer","Thank you Pat and good morning. Starting with a review of operating metrics for the quarter on Slide 7, velocity of 27.5 miles per hour improved versus prior year while Dwell increase driven primarily by our northern Mexico terminals. ","Congestion phase in Q1 and early Q2 has the [indiscernible] in the Houston area and we have been working hard to clear the cross-border traffic that backed up the Northern Mexico during that time. This congestion is largely behind us, and Dwell should continue to moderate through the rest of Q3.","Other highlights for the quarter include the announcement that we will purchase 15 new high horsepower locomotives with deliveries starting in Q1 2019. This provides a great opportunity for us to modernize our fleet with more efficient, more reliable and lower costs to maintain units and positions us to handle more line of [indiscernible] trains specifically in the refined products area. ","Offsetting this purchase is the disposition of approximately 30 older switching and low horsepower units additionally, we look to reduce the least units that we have had online over the past several months. Overall, our active fleet will remain largely unchanged with the acquisition of these new units.","PTC work continues on schedule and we project to be fully equipped on our network by the 2018 deadline, approximately 60% of our subdivisions are in PTC revenue service that's up from 40% as reported at the end of Q1. We continue to experience only minor impacts to our operations as we move territories in [Q3] (Ph). ","Turning to Slide 8. Our cross-border volume outlook is strong as Brian will outline in more detail. We continue to work on operational improvements at the border to ensure we have capacity to achieve planned growth. In addition to the joint U.S.-Mexico customs facility, which began operation last summer we have now started our international crew operation. ","This operation will improve fluidity, safety and security at the border and will provide public benefit by reducing the amount of blocked crossings in Laredo. Future technology enhancements such as [indiscernible] scanning of trains and data processing improvements are other opportunities to improve fluidity at the bridge. ","Turning to Slide 9. This map shows 2017 foreign direct investment in Mexico. Despite ongoing trade negotiations foreign direct investment in Mexico has grown. Prior capacity investments we have discussed such as Sanchez, [indiscernible] and on joint KCSUP trackage rights in Texas as well as future projects such as upgrades to the mainline between Monterey and [Matamoras] (Ph) and at the ports of Veracruz and Tampico all aligned with foreign investments into Mexico and related cross-border opportunities. ","As indicated on the map, the highest concentration of foreign investment is in the northern and central regions that we serve. Brian will go into additional details around specific customer projects in these areas, specifically related to the refined products, plastics and automotive industries. ","I will now turn the presentation over to Brian. ","Brian Hancock","Thank you Jeff and good morning. I will start my comments on Page 11 where you can see second quarter year-over-year revenue was up 4% and volumes were up 1%, despite headwinds from the closure of large utility customer facility in Texas. ","Both volume and revenue increased for five of our six business units, additionally in the second quarter we achieved record franchise cross-border Carloads and revenue benefiting from the growth in key areas such as refined products, plastics, automotive, and cross-border and mobile. ","During the quarter, our revenue per unit grew 3% despite mixed pressure from the loss of the long haul utility coal business and unfavorable FX impact. Positive core pricing was in line with the first quarter pricing of about 3% and our outlook on pricing remains very positive as 2Q renewals were up from the mid single-digit range. ","The Chemical and Petroleum business unit revenue growth of 14% was primarily driven by plastics and petroleum. The plastics revenue growth of 24% was driven by favorable domestic and cross border volumes and very strong demand in Mexico. Petroleum revenue grew 14% driven by strength in soft bond unit train and manifest refine products related to Mexico energy reform.","In Q2 Mexican energy reform carloads and revenue grew 84% and 57% respectively and we included an update on this important and growing business segment in the appendix of our earnings slide. Our strong performance and refine products was partially offset by lower heavy fuel oil volumes at the tool in Mexico and refinery continues to experience production challenges.","Revenue from our industrial and consumer business unit grew 3% in Q2, this business unit benefited from strong paper and appliance revenues due to tightening truck capacity and increase around paper demand, partially offset by lower metals revenue and length of haul was negatively impacted by shift in customer sourcing service.","Agriculture and minerals revenue was up 1% year-over-year, growth in grain and ores and mineral was partially offset by food products due to a plant expansion project at one of our customers facilities that require temporary shutdown. We are encourage that the congestion that impacted this segment during the first quarter has improved as evidence by better performance at the end of second quarter and early third quarter. ","Similar to the last quarter, energies revenue decline of 20% was driven by a previously announced closure of a power generation facility in Texas and by frac sand sourcing changes. These declines were partially by offset by higher volume and pricing in our crude oil business driven by increase production in Canada with decrease pipeline capacity.","In motor revenue increased 3% with mix performance by length, both U.S. domestic and cross border business posted solid performance as we continue to benefit from truck conversion. This growth was partially offset by a 15% year-over-year decline in [indiscernible]. As we continue experiencing pricing pressures driven by weaker Mexican peso, we are actively pursuing strategies to regain this market share without suffering the long-term negative effects of unsustainable pricing concessions. ","Revenue from our automotive business was up 17% over prior you with improvements in both volume and revenue per unit. Increases were driven by carry over inventories, increased plant production and growth in vehicles imported into Mexico through the port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. We continue working with our customers to address inventory congestion by providing unique service solutions that address some of the temporary congestion and equipment issues being seen throughout the rail industry.","On Slide 12, we provide an outlook for the second half of 2018 for each of the business segments. As Pat mentioned, our full-year volume outlook maybe below mid single-digits, we still expect a sequential increase in the second half of 2018 as growth from key businesses accelerate and we benefits from easier constitute to hurricane impacts during the second half of 2017.","Starting to Chemical and Petroleum, Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a significant focus in 2018, volume growth from refine products accelerates in the second half of 2018 as additional storage capacity comes online. Additionally we expect plastics to grow in the second half of 2018 as new petrochemical capacity begins production.","We also expect to see continuing solid growth in the inner motor across the border and U.S. domestic range as we benefit from conversion of a freight currently looking like truck. L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas will be a particular focus during the second half of 2018 as we evaluate our strategy to gain back that market share in a market that is ground zero for transportation impacts of changes in market flow and capacity in for Mexico City. These shipments also have an impact on our volume growth assumptions for the second half of 2018. ","We will continue to see solid performance in our automotive business with growth trending ahead of most third-party estimates for Mexican production. In addition to increasing production in Mexico, our growth will benefit from market share gains with some of our biggest customers. New equipment coming online during the third quarter will be a welcome support for this business there in the second half of 218. ","Our industrial and consumer business unit will continue to benefit from strong demand and tight truck capacity, particularly in the paper and appliance businesses. We are closely monitoring the ongoing trade developments for any potential impacts on metals business as well as other segments. We expect our Ag and NIM volumes to be slightly up from second half of 2018 with steady demand in both grain and food products. ","As previously noted, we expect our energy business to be down year-over-year and during the second half of 2018 as it will be impacted by the closing of the coal fired power generation facility in Texas. However, we do expect continued growth in Canadian crude as customer volumes and the new contracts started ramping up towards the end of Q2 and have continued into Q3. ","Over the last few months the question has been raised on whether we would continue to invest in Mexico at the pace we have over the last few years. As Jeff mentioned, we are continuing to work on both capacity and fluidity as well as origin and destination opportunities on online. ","On Page 13 we wanted to provide just a short list of projects that have been publicly announced that KCS will be servicing. As you can see, we have over 20 customer projects as well as major opportunities at the ports of Veracruz, Altamira and L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. As referenced on this slide you can see that our cross-border business was up 19% in Q2, demonstrating that each line of business continues to grow as trade increases between Mexico and U.S. ","KCS continues to be confident in the economic decisions that are being made by our customers as well as those we are making ourselves. As we have already mentioned foreign direct investment in Mexico remain strong and KCS will continue to appropriately invest to support the objectives and the growth plans of our customers. ","Now I will turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch. ","Michael Upchurch","Thanks Briana and good morning. ","I will start my comments on Slide 15. Carload volumes increased 1% while revenues increased 4% predominantly from rising fuel prices. Carloads and revenues were negatively impacted mainly due to the decline in our coal business resulting from the closure of the utility plant in Texas. Excluding the decline in coal, volumes increased 3% and revenue 7%. And we did see strong sequential revenue growth at 7% with strong incremental margins of 60% plus. ","Operating ratio increased from 63.5 in 2Q of 2017 to 64.0 in 2Q 2018. We experienced cost headwinds from higher year-over-year PTC expenses of approximately five million and six million in higher casualty costs. In total, contributing about 150 basis points of the impact to OR. ","We also saw higher fuel prices that increased 33% in the U.S. and 16% in Mexico. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.6% lower than our guidance of 30%. During the quarter we saw benefits from the lower guilty tax and the State of Missouri lowering their corporate tax rate from 6.25% to 4%. ","Our reported effective tax rate was 24.2% lower than our adjusted effective tax rate primarily due to new guidance issued by the IRS in April that lowered our repatriation tax by approximately $4 million. We continue to believe our full adjusted effective tax rate will be approximately 30%. ","Finally, we continue to be encouraged by our discussions with various congressional offices and the treasury department regarding some relief of the unintended consequences of the guilty tax. We believe there maybe additional interpretive guidance issued by the treasury department sometime this fall that may help us mitigate at least part of our current guilty tax provision estimate of $17.5 million for 2018. ","Reported second quarter diluted earnings per share increased 14% to a $1.45 per share while adjusted diluted EPS increased 16% to $1.54. Average outstanding shares for the quarter were a $102.5 million, a reduction of more than three million share from the you ago. More details on reported and adjusted diluted EPS can be found on page 24 in the appendix and a more detailed P&L is available on page 23 in the appendix. ","Turning to Slide 16, second quarter operating expenses increased 5% or $20 million over second quarter 2017. As I mentioned earlier expenses increased primarily due to fuel prices, depreciation which was predominantly from PTC and $6 million in casualties in materials and other expense line item which did include a negative year-over-year comparison due to a $2 million casualty credit we booked in 2Q, 2017. Offsetting those increases, were foreign exchange benefits of $5 million of fuel consumption and efficiency savings of $3 million. ","Turning to Slide 17, second quarter compensation expense declined 2% or $3 million, drivers of lower compensation and benefit expense include $4 million in lower incentive compensation in 2Q, 2017 lower than expected benefit cost and foreign exchange benefits. Offsetting those declines were a $2 increase from higher headcount and wage inflation of $3 million. ","Turning to Slide 18, second quarter fuel expense increased 17% as a result of a 33% increase in fuel price in the U.S. and a 16% increase in the price of fuel in Mexico. Offsetting those price increases we experienced 4% lower GPMs reducing our consumption realized the foreign currency benefit of $2 million and additional $1 million in improve fuel efficiency. ","Turning to Slide 19, let me briefly discuss our capital allocation priorities. As Jeff and Brian discussed earlier, our first priority continues to be investing in our various growth opportunities. Our 28 CapEx guidance remains unchanged at $530 million to $550 million. We expect 2018 to be our third year in a row of declining CapEx spend and declining CapEx to revenue ratio. ","We also continue to explore investment opportunities in venture that might drive more revenue growth on our railroad such as refined product receiving terminals in Mexico. During the quarter we repurchased 503,000 shares of our common stock on accumulative basis have now incurred $364 million to repurchase 3.4 million shares under the $800 million board authorized program we announced in August of 2017. ","During the quarter we repurchased approximately 100 million of equipment on lease and now own approximately 77% of our equipment up from 20% in 2011. Overall, our strategy of owning more of our equipment has achieved in approximately 250 basis point improvement in OR. ","And finally, we were very pleased to have Moody's upgrade our credit rating to be AA 2, and we look forward to the day, S&P also recognizes just how much our credit has improved in the more than five years since their last upgrade. ","And with that, I will turn it back to Pat. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay, just a couple of comments here before we open up for the Q&A. Obviously one of the significant new development since our last quarterly call would be the elections in Mexico on July 1. I think everyone knows how that turned out and as expected to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador known as AMLO was the winner of the presidential election in a very wide margin. ","His Morena party coalition won 61% of the seats in the House of deputies and 54% of the seats in the Senate, which is obviously a majority but fall short of the two-thirds majority that would be required for any constitutional amendments. Based on his postelection comments and messaging that has come from himself and his key staff and cabinet leaders, we really are pleased with that commentary and don't expect that he will pursue any constitutional amendments adverse to our interests or adverse to the economy and strength of the economy in Mexico. ","Obviously financial markets have been relatively calm and positive about this result. Peso has appreciated about 5% and as you have seen in some of the data that we presented here in the second quarter both foreign direct investment in Mexico was up significantly and our cross-border business revenues and volumes also increased significantly. ","So it's very early on, I will say we like what we see in terms of the messaging, the dialogue with the U.S. government leaders, meeting with the secretary Pompeo and Secretary of [indiscernible] and others that took place a few weeks ago, seem to be very positive off to a good start, but its early and obviously we will keep our fingers on the pulse and stay very close to the transition team as we move forward to the December transition of the government and see how things develop from that point on.","In the past, I have offered suggestions for the headlines for our quarterly performance and outlook which I'm certain all of you find extremely helpful, particularly those who are writing research updates over the weekend. When I look at our performance and commentary and the way we feel about the outlook, some of the potential headlines that comes to my mind are solid volume and revenue growth in most strategic growth areas. ","Very pleased with the performance in automotive, plastics, refine products, the growth in our cross order business was just outstanding. As I mentioned at the very beginning, we are certainly disappointed with the 1% volume growth, but feel like the weakness is isolated to energy, some of which is crude oil timing and the international intermodal which Brian talked about in his comments and we will probably have some questions on that later on. ","Second half outlook points to improve sequential growth in both volume and revenue and I would finish by saying the long-term outlook shows multiple oversize growth opportunities in several of our strategic growth areas. Feel very good about the future, long-term and short-term so all things considered we can ever feel too disappointed about any quarter which shows record revenues and earnings per share. ","While its very early on in the New Mexican Administration we are optimistic about the initial commentary that is coming from the new leadership team and the outlook for improved U.S., Mexico relations and possibly a revolution of Naphtha in the near-term.","So, with that I will conclude and open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting the question-and- answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Hi, great. Good morning. Hi, Pat thanks for the thoughts there at the end. Maybe just expanding on that a little bit. Can you talk a bit about the production challenges in energy maybe some of the timeline to get there? And then secondly on pricing, Mike you talked a bit about pricing maybe talk about when we should expect that it accelerating given some of the market tightness right now? ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Ken, what you mean by production challenges in energy? ","Ken Hoexter","I thought that\u2019s what was set up earlier in terms of getting the production in Mexico, the facilities I thought you said there was production challenges? ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay. ","Brian Hancock","Yes. Ken, this is Brian I will take that. Its primarily storage capability capacity in Mexico around refine products. As we have told you before there are at least four or five major storage facilities being constructed on our line right now. The majority of those will be at least one or two tanks completed in the fourth quarter or early first quarter 2019. ","Right now we are moving a lot of the unit trends and then they are being offloaded directly into truck and so that will help us significantly and we have that storage capacity and space. When it comes to pricing, what I would tell you is we feel very comfortable with where we are at both on our renewals as well as our same store pricing, we\u2019d be feel very comfortable and we are going to be in that mid single-digit range moving forward and continuing into the accelerate into the back half of the year.","Most of our major let's say opportunities on the refined products area. There is just so many things that are happening, but we are very, very comfortable that we are going to hit that mid-single-digit range on our renewal. So hopefully that gives what you need.","Ken Hoexter","Yes and then my quote on pricing, on the timing for maybe given the timing and the market when we could see the acceleration you were referring to.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Well I think it was Brian made those comments but I think you are going to see a pickup in third quarter based on the renewals in the second quarter. ","Ken Hoexter","Great. I appreciate the time guys. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you very much. God morning gentlemen. Staying on pricing a bit, [indiscernible] between your core pricing in the quarter 3% renewals are 5% and that obviously those rounds going forward where is the strength coming from? And why do you think the market is jumping like this? This is all of the tightness in the trucking space or are there other things that are working in?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Jason this is Brian. I would say we are seeing it fairly broadly. We feel very comfortable in our automotive business, in our chemical and petroleum business, industrial consumer. So we see it fairly broadly, certainly intermodal domestically and cross-border as truck conversion continues to happen. It's a great pricing environment for the intermodal carriers. So I feel that it\u2019s pretty wide slot if you will around pricing. We feel very comfortable. It\u2019s a great environment for us and our customers are actively looking for options on rail and so we feel pretty good in that space right now. ","Michael Upchurch","Jason, this is Mike. I might just add one thing. The soft spot in pricing for us has been for a while intermodal in Mexico, particularly at the port at L\u00e1zaro where we are billing in U.S. dollars, truckers are billing in pesos. So our service has effectively become 50% more expensive over the last five years given what has happened with the currency. ","But we are looking at some rebate opportunities types of volume increases that would help fill out some trains that aren't at maximum length. So we want to look at those opportunities anywhere from 25% to 35% capacity left on those trains, if we can sale that out I think we might be successful and driving a bit more volume at L\u00e1zaro. ","Jason Seidl","And that should help to incremental margin at L\u00e1zaro so much capacity. Let me stick with some cross border commentary because you mentioned that. You mentioned it was like the strongest growth you have seen I think every cross border. What are the reasons behind that? Are people trying to shift ahead of - I mean maybe issues with tariffs or with NAFTA or people really just starting some of the peak season a little bit early?","Brian Hancock","No I would say Jason I think that there is a couple of things that are driving, certainly there is more intermodal business our new service with [indiscernible] is continue to increase, our source with UP, continues to grow. We are also seeing some sourcing changes in field where product may have been coming from China or other places, it\u2019s now coming in through the U.S. and then down into Mexico into the steel plants, and so there are some sourcing changes in the steel area that are having a pretty significant impact on cross-border. ","It impacts our line of the length of haul, but overall we are very positive on the way that our cross-border business and the fluidity that Jeff and his team are creating at the border, we are going to continue to utilize that and try to feel each of those trains our as that business continues to grow.","Michael Upchurch","I would just add to that, because I don\u2019t think you mentioned refine products that opportunity in spite of the some of the challenges in storage and facility and capacity that Brian mentioned earlier that business is growing very, very rapidly. So, we ask ourselves the same question, Jason if some of this sort of a little bit of blip in because of concern about what is going to happen with tariffs and trade, we just don\u2019t see it. ","I will jump on that one, because I\u2019m sure there will be questions later on about the impact of tariff and so far we just haven\u2019t see any impact, any negative impact in our business, even into the third quarter, because of tariffs that have been announced or threatened or both of those. ","And I will make one more comment about L\u00e1zaro, I think that is an important consideration as you all think about the volume weakness that we have seen in the first half. Business is there and as I said in my comments there is a lot of strength in our business across the board, it feels to me like our business is stronger than our results reflect. ","And we have talked a lot about the timing of crude oil, but I think the international L\u00e1zaro intermodal business is another area of weakness and we have been very thoughtful about how we view at that. So, the business is there, if we were more aggressive in discounting to retain or gain share back, I think our volume numbers would have been better. ","We are trying to be very thoughtful about how we deal with that as Mike mentioned with rebase, volume incentives other things rather than just cutting prices and we will continue to try to address that. But I think it\u2019s important to say that the core business is there, we have just chosen not to do what some of our customers might want us to do in terms of pricing reaction to maintain that volume.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","AllisonLandry","Good morning. Thanks. So, just on some of your comments regarding L\u00e1zaro, Pat. How do we, in terms of the second half of the year, how much of a drag do you think that L\u00e1zaro could be in terms of total intermodal volumes are even your overall volumes. Just, as we think about the worsening decline in the second quarter and that looks like comp in the back half of the year is pretty difficult. So, just trying to understand that this is an incremental risk to the second half of those?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I will ask Brian to get into more detail, I don\u2019t think there is incremental risk, I really think there is some upside, some opportunity to gain business back and share back, but again we are going to be very thoughtful. At the end of the day, I hope you appreciate this, we are going to be disciplined about how we price that business to maintain an acceptable level of profitability and returns. And, but I think there is more upside and opportunity in the second half in international and motor.","BrianHancock","Yes, Allison this is Brian, I would say the only thing I would add to what Pat said, is whenever you end up in a situation where someone has made a pricing decision that impacts a large market like that, what happens as you get flow imbalance, and these end up in places they shouldn't be. There is not enough capacity to handle other pieces and so there is always a transition there is always a recalibrating of where that freight comes in, and we are right in the middle of that. ","So we are actually trying to take advantage of some of the actions that have been taken in the past and be able to be a thoughtful provider that provides a secure way into Mexico City without taking an unsustainable pricing action that we just don't think it's something that that can last longer than a three or four month timeframe. ","And so we feel very comfortable with our plan that Mike kind of laid out, using the rebates, allowing people to use us, so I don't think there is additional risk and we are certainly looking to try to make those opportunities more prevalent here in the second half. But it's certainly something that we are managing on a daily basis and our team is very engaged and understand what is going on all the ports on the western side of Mexico. ","Allison Landry","Okay, so just to clarify it sounds like you are taking these actions as we peak and hopefully you will see some of the volumes come back a little bit. Is that fair?","Brian Hancock","Absolutely, most of the actions have already been taken Allison, so we are in the middle of it right now. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","And remember there is typically a build at L\u00e1zaro because the peak season and we are going to get some benefit from that in third and fourth quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. ","RaviShanker","Thank you. If I can just follow up on the pricing commentary. I think it's pretty interesting that you are getting mid-single-digit pricing on renewals but I think you also said that some customers may not be willing to give you business at the price you want. So how do you find a balance there between price that you are willing to take and the volumes? The mid-single-digit is kind of above what we are hearing from any other rail on renewals. So does it make or maybe ease up the gas there and maybe find get some more volumes? ","BrianHancock","Ravi this is Brian, I will take that one and then I\u2019m sure pass it Mike, who has some input there. I would say that I think from a pricing environment we have so many new opportunities that are happening. Pat mentioned refined products, the changes that are happening in both paper markets the way that box companies are used, they allow us for some additional opportunities.","Intermodal obviously is an area right now where the entire market is seeing pricing capability. We believe that we are being very thoughtful. We have responsibility obviously within Mexico to play within some regulations that allow us to be in the space where we create the maximum amount of value for the freight that we're moving. So we are looking at continued opportunities in both our automotive space, long-term contracts that we put in place, industrial consumer, and the chemical and petroleum business. ","We are also looking at some additional businesses off of some of the ports that give us new opportunities with existing customers. And so when you think about that we are being very thoughtful. We're in the space of making sure that we have not only market share gains that Jeff and his team are creating the capacity and fluidity necessary. ","But like Pat said the business is there we just need to make sure that we are being thoughtful in the way that we go at, especially in that international intermodal business. It does not make sense I have said this before, it does not make sense to rush to the bottom of the barrel from a pricing perspective because of the weakness in the peso and the weakness in some of the other things in some of the other poor areas. ","So, we feel like we have a great strategy, we are going to continue to monitor it every day with our customers and we get a lot of feedback from them. So, I think we are in a very balanced position right now. ","Michael Upchurch","Ravi, just going to add one point, Pat I think did a pretty good job of summarizing the disappointment around few of our components of the business, call I think that story is well known, we talked about that almost a year ago. L\u00e1zaro and then crude, the crude was just the timing issue for us. ","So, I think when you look at the rest of our business, we see a lot of strength in pricing and we use a lot of discipline with our network organization or marketing organization and finance all collaborating to make sure that we are getting the kind of yield and incremental margins that we are targeting. ","Ravi Shanker","Got it. Also it\u2019s kind of hard to predict what politician would do when they go off, but when the new government takes over end of this year. Basically you understanding do you think economic priorities and things like maybe addressing competition and the concession are like top of mind for them? Or do you think there are other social priorities that will come first. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how quickly off they take over will be known kind of what the impact is for you guys? ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, is on the phone, so I might key this up and then ask Jos\u00e9 to comment as well. I think if you look at the main messaging of Amlo and Marina is about corruption security other things that are of very high important to Mexicans and doing with economic improvement in the economy by reducing or eradicating the cost and consequences of corruption. ","So far based on what has been said in the messaging both public and private in and meetings that we have had it doesn\u2019t appear that there is certainly no anti-America, anti-Naphtha. They seem to very much appreciate the economic in the investment foreign investment that has clearly benefited Mexico. ","So, I guess the answer to your question is we don\u2019t expect that to be top of mind in terms of major changes and the strategy or approach that the new administration is going to take once the transition occurs. Jos\u00e9, any additional commentary there. ","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya","Okay. Just to comment on that in the meetings, we have with new elected President that [indiscernible].","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Reustle","Thanks for taking the question. Curious when you factor in the sound is the first half of some of the momentum that you have going into the back half. Is the full-year of our improvement are achievable. And particularly when you lookout to 2019, do you expect that given that what you\u2019re saying about the quality of the carload the pricing and the tailwinds that are going to there. Is that where we could see a material change and improvement? ","Michael Upchurch","Yes, Matt this is Mike. I will take that one. Obviously we are now where we want to be through the first half of the year with respect to our OR. We are slightly worse than we were a year ago. But our goal continues to be full-year improvement in the operating ratio. We have got some momentum in the business as we have been discussing here for the last 20, 30 minutes. And I think that volume will allow us to continue to improve our operating ratio. Believe me nobody here is taking their eye off the ball in terms of improving OR and we have certainly incentives tied to that as well.","Matthew Reustle","And then to follow up to your earlier point that you are not seeing any accelerate demand as a result of the trade overhang. Do you think there is any pockets of pent up demand, just trying to get a sense of whether the business would be operating any differently if all the headlines overhangs right there.","Michael Upchurch","Yes, that\u2019s a tough question. We ask ourselves that all the time and the way we feel about it is we really haven't seen any tangible evidence that companies are pulling back or withdrawing. There is a lot of press earlier this year I guess it was last year about Ford. I think that was kind of misunderstood Ford did cancel a plant in Mexico, but they built it in China. ","And there are just a lot of examples that we have seen where customers have taken a hard turn or reverse course. We don't know what we don't know and when I say that, I mean, we don't know that there are companies that have discussed projects or right on the cusp or on the verge of making investments in Mexico that haven\u2019t moved forward because of those concerns. ","Our sense is that there is some of that, but it's very hard to quantify. And then you just look at our business, look at our cross-border volume growth. I can tell you there is in spite of all the rhetoric and the concern about the election and NAFTA and all of those things in the refined products and the energy segment people are going actually full steam ahead. ","If we had capacity and facilities and terminals that could handle more business, we would be growing faster than we are in that segment. So they are not hesitating at all to move into those markets and pursue those opportunities. ","And then you just look at the foreign direct investment stats that Brian and Jeff talked about, so it certainly doesn't feel like this overhang is causing any serious delays or traffic was to be growth in Mexico.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","ChristianWetherbee","Good morning guys. I want ask a little bit about the volume sort of outlook. So 3% to 4% Pat I think is the new number, you gave one in the first half, you started looking for I guess mid single maybe even a little bit better than the broadcast. I know we have the comps and we have some of the ramp up in some refined products. But maybe if you could unpack that a little bit maybe by quarter. Do you expect to see that come back here in 3Q? Or do we have to wait more to 4Q and get some of that storage to open up in Mexico before we see those types of growth rates realized? ","Michael Upchurch","This is Mike. Maybe I will give that one of the shot. Obviously we are 1% volume growth through the first half of the year. The comps get much easier for us in the third quarter given the Hurricane that we dealt with last year. But, when you begin to put the building blocks together, we think there is an opportunity to see a couple of percentage point increases as a result of comps related to the Hurricane. ","We think there is a point around refine product, we think there is a point around crude, and then I think area that is highest risk for us right now would be intermodal given all the issues that we have discussed in getting some return back of volumes to the port of L\u00e1zaro and that could be L\u00e1zaro plus other intermodal about two points. ","And that\u2019s how we get to the, our low end of the mid single-digits and we will see whether we are right or not, but hopefully those give you the building blocks and that means the rest of the business continues to stay healthy and grows at about same rate that it did in the first half. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","And I will add one big caveat to that commentary and that is we are not forecasting the Hurricane this you. And obviously that\u2019s a wild card, so some of the comps and some of the commentary about the second half of the year is clearly driven by the fact that we had a big Hurricane impact last year, bigger than normal and we just, we don\u2019t know what is going to happen this year, so, that\u2019s a complete wild card, but I just fall back on what I said a couple of times here. ","It really feels to me and I think to us the business is stronger than the results would indicate and don\u2019t want to make excuses but crude oil was timing, intermodal is part of a thoughtful and intentional strategy, the business is there, we are trying to figure out the way you get back without as Brian said going to the bottom of barrels. So, we will continue to be discipline about that, but the business is there, we just got a find to way to get it back on our railroad in a way that make sense.","BrianHancock","I just want to add one thing, this is Brian. We are seeing some strength in the couple of areas in L\u00e1zaro that I do want to talk about, we are importing more vehicles into L\u00e1zaro than we had thought. Some of our customers are up over 60% and what they are bringing into Mexico from other areas, these are for vehicle consumption in Mexico. ","So, Mexico as a trading partner is been very successful on L\u00e1zaro is a big part of that port strategy for them. And we are seeing some success there. So, we are picking up some additional volume in L\u00e1zaro that we didn\u2019t have before, we talked a little bit about the steel, sourcing changes, but again there is a lot going on down in the Port of L\u00e1zaro. ","So, we think that there is a very good strategy, we can keep going down the path we are, watching it daily, but making sure that we are competitive not only in intermodal, but in automotive, steel, carload and certainly the their export volumes that they are sending out to the Asian and to the Western side of South America. So, we feel very comfortable with the way we are operating down in L\u00e1zaro.","ChristianWetherbee","Okay. That\u2019s really a helpful guys. I appreciate all of that. And then Mike, I just wanted to make sure I understood your comments earlier in the call about incremental margin. I think you were giving that some numbers sort of the call for the quarter and maybe there is a 50% incremental margin number that was associated with sort of the coal business.","I just wanted to understand if that\u2019s right and then when you think about sort of these potential tailwinds to volumes as you move into the back half of the year it\u2019s sort of 50ish, the right number. I don\u2019t want to get too specific with the guidance, but how do you think about the incremental and an environment where major growing closer to mid singles?","Michael Upchurch","Yes. I think the incremental in 2Q were more around 25%. Not to get into the game of excluding things but we had a tough casualty quarter that probably would have gotten us a little bit closer to that 40 to 50% range. The sequential incremental margin was low 60% that was my comment.","And I think it's safe to say if we execute against the volume forecasts that we have here that's going to allow us to continue to target and generate roughly 50% incremental margin. That's been our long-standing goal. If we continue to see the volume that we are seeing here in July play out through the rest of the year I think we will be in pretty good shape.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","JustinLong","Good morning. So wanted to follow-up first on L\u00e1zaro. First how much of the market share headwind would you say the function of truckload competition versus competition from other ports? And secondly as we think about your ability to recapture some of this market share based on the changes you have talked about do you have a target on where you would like to see market share go relative to where it is today?","Michael Upchurch","Yes. Just what I would say is up until I would say, probably the April timeframe the majority of the competition was truck, was peso-based there are obviously pricing pesos were priced in dollars from an international perspective and so there was a significant deviation there between the two truck and rail. ","I would say in Manzanillo, there were a couple of things that were done from a pricing perspective, not only from a shipping line perspective out of Asia. But those rates were cut, I would say from a shipping line perspective to the point where there was really no reason for us to change that volume. ","So I think the key is making sure that we understand how the shipping lines are going to use us, how the competition in truck is going to use port of L\u00e1zaro. We feel very comfortable that the program we put in place makes us more competitive than any other mode based on the volumes that they would be able to bring into that now. ","We understand that most of the decisions around those things are made in early parts of the year, February, January as when those bids happened. So we're looking at capitalizing on congestion that may be caused by some of the other things that are happening at some of the other Western ports. ","So it's a very complex issue, it certainly is multimodal and multi-pork, but we feel very comfortable. If our customer and those that are looking for options into the Mexico City area take advantage of the programs that we have offered for the back half of this year they will not only having more secure transit into Mexico, better service, but also be very, very cost competitive. So I think it\u2019s a good strategy and I think we are in the right space and we will see just what happens.","BrianHancock","Let me chime in here and address your question about market share specifically. We don't like to lose business. We have capacity on trains and on intermodal trains that we would like fill up and get some of that business back.","We don't really have a market share target., we are going to be thoughtful and careful and make sure that we price this business and disciplined about returns and profitability because it's a big driver of our volume weakness. I think it's a big opportunity for us going forward if we can kind of reach agreement with our customer.","Certain amount of this is brinkmanship and negotiation, we think we have a better service, we have a more secure service and we have a lot of other business in L\u00e1zaro, automotive and others, petroleum that is competing for capacity. ","So, again I hope you guys give us some credit for being disciplined about this, we could have shown better volume numbers and we have been more aggressive in responding to the market and the pricing but just to make sense for to do that. ","JustinLong","Thanks. That\u2019s all really helpful color. I think secondly, Mike I just wanted to touch on a few guidance items. I think last quarter you talked about DNA coming in at around $360 million for the full-year that Mexican fuel exercise tax credit being about $35 million. Any update to those two numbers and also curious if you could comment on your expectations for instance in the back half?","Michael Upchurch","Yes. No, we are still in that range $360 million for the full-year for depreciation. The tax credit, exercise tax credit there are continually moving that up and down, it\u2019s hard to predict but I think that\u2019s probably still a pretty good estimate. I think as we look out through the rest of the year, we feel pretty good about expenses, there are no great headwinds, I think you will see a little bit of step up in comp given the volumes that we have been discussing here, that will drive some incremental fuel from the volume perspective but those would be kind of our key headwinds going throughout the year. And I think you have a second part our that question that I don\u2019t recall now.","JustinLong","Incentive comp in the back half, I know there were some abnormal trends last year with the Hurricane. So, wanted to get your thoughts around that?","Michael Upchurch","Yes. You saw in the slide on comp and benefits that we have a decline in incentive comp on a year-over-year basis. If the performance doesn\u2019t move up, I would expect we will continue to see year-over-year declines, but we are not really prepare to give you any specific guidance on that. Too many open items, we try to accrue based on our forecast, actual results for the first six months and forecast for the back half. But, I think it\u2019s safe to say it will be lower than it was in 2017.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wadewitz","Yes. Good morning. I got a couple of on the volume side for you. I know there is been a lot of discussion on this, but a new approach on L\u00e1zaro intermodal. What, it sounds like you were to put some of that in front of the customers. What is the response and what is the kind of conviction level, I think Mike you said that if I understood right, we do think you have two points of added volume growth from the response of the L\u00e1zaro. And just trying to get a sense of your conviction visibility that they took place?","Michael Upchurch","Yes. That\u2019s L\u00e1zaro slash Intermodal. You remember L\u00e1zaro is about 25% of our overall intermodal business.","Thomas Wadewitz","Okay. Yes, specifically in L\u00e1zaro, just seeing those volumes go instead of being down 15% being up year-over-year, is that good visibility or how do you think about that?","Michael Upchurch","I think that we are, I think the customer feedback has been positive. I think what you have to remember though is again those decisions have been made from a port and from a protocol perspective. And it\u2019s so really going to depend on what happens on the ground at the other ports if this congestion, if there has to be rerouting and if there has to be other decisions where capacity drives up. ","So I think we are in a very interesting capacity constrained world right now, specifically in the Mexico City and this just changes on a weekly and monthly basis. So what I would say is we're watching it closely. The customers are positive on the fact that we address the pricing issue against the peso, but I would say there are also very - they want to understand the volume commitments they want to understand and we as well.","We are not in it for the short-term, we are not in it to try to make one quarter or another, we are trying to have good long-term relationships with these carriers that make it very secure, very cost-effective way for them to ship into Mexico City using rail. And I think that's what they're seeing in our strategy.","So hopefully we will see benefits if we continue to see pricing that\u2019s I will call irrational in certain modes. We are in the middle of the fight there is no doubt about it.","Thomas Wadewitz","So what do you think it turns positive or just kind of less where as if you look at second half on L\u00e1zaro volume.","Brian Hancock","Certainly less worse, the opportunity is there, the business is there for it to turn positive. And I just want to - I think I have said this thing two to three times now. So we haven\u2019t changed our strategy. The market changed and we held our discipline. We think that's the right way to approach it. ","We think we have got a superior service, we have got superior security and the capacity is certainly there, but we are going to remain disciplined in our response to changing markets and make sure that we handle this in a way that generates an acceptable return and acceptable profitability.","Michael Upchurch","And Tom when we look back over the last five years given the depreciation of the peso, we are far better off having stuck with price, both from a revenue and margin standpoint. So that's why we feel pretty strongly about how we have handled the pricing strategy and the impacts in the market.","Brian Hancock","Disciplined. ","Operator","Our next question is from the Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","ScottGroup","Hey guys thanks. Good morning. So why don\u2019t you just talk one more again on is the L\u00e1zaro rebate. So I think you said that because the peso there is sort of like a 50% effective change in your cost versus trucking cost. What percent rebate are we talking about here? And I guess when you said disciplined obviously it got a lot of attention how do you get comfort that rebates don\u2019t spread to the existing book of business? And maybe just with that is this also showing up it all in cross border just because I see cross border intermodal revenue per car was down a bit in the second quarter as well.","Michael Upchurch","I will take it of those. No, we don\u2019t see its spreading to our book of business, it's tied to growth. And the cross-border revenue per unit, I think is primarily driven by the very short length of haul that we have on the U.S. side connected to the BNSF service. ","Brian Hancock","Right, and the fact that we get paid on empty there that have a lower rate than the full loads, but that\u2019s been good business for us, the volume growth we have seen from BNSF.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","So Scott I would tell you from a percentage perspective we don\u2019t obviously give that kind of information out, but what I would tell you as you have to take into account a couple of things. Certainly there is a vessel portion of a movement from Asia, there is a rail or England portion we have to look at the way that truck is handle inside each of the ports, specifically around trains load and train shipment and then you have to look at the capacity out of each one of the ports. ","So, I would tell you it\u2019s customer-by-customer, it\u2019s certainly dependent upon where the product is coming from and going to from a shipping line perspective, but we are working very closely with our shipping customers and in a very fluid environment. So, certainly something that\u2019s important, but we are not obviously going to continue those types of percentages.","ScottGroup","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask about the change over to the international cruise. I don\u2019t think you get any questions there. Is this in your mind a more of a volume or cost opportunity. And maybe just with this change over to the international cruise. Just refresh us, what your capacity on across border trains is going to go to and what the current number of trains is today?","Jeffrey Songer","Yes, Scott this is Jeff. This initiative is all about fluidity and growth, it\u2019s not a cost saving measure for say, we are actually hiring and adding a few cruise on the US side to get these trains from these refine products trains mainly on across the border below from Allman, Corpus Christi down to the bridge. ","This simply change a few minutes of a very train that was across the bridge, so it\u2019s a capacity place Scott, its volume play. It\u2019s also a safety play, it\u2019s a public benefit play for reducing while crossing that stop either going south well capacity at [indiscernible] train that\u2019s stop and have their crude change on the middle of the bridge coming north are subject to maybe more [indiscernible] than trains that want to roll right through there.","So, currently we have seen some good benefits this year already with the other initiatives, the customs improvements we saw last year, we are pushing probably over the last couple of months at an average of 25 to 26 trains across the bridge. Right now we started down national cruise world and running maybe four trains a day with international cruise. It will take us quite a while to qualify all trains with cruise for the international cruise to operate on. ","So, it\u2019s a long-term initiatives, it\u2019s going to continue to gain in this marginal time on every train across the bridge until we get this fully implemented.","Michael Upchurch","I think the key thing is as Jeff mentioned it\u2019s a capacity for growth, its security, it\u2019s safety. We are not reducing American jobs, we are not exporting American jobs to Mexico, this is all about growth and more efficiency. We have been working on this for five or more years, it\u2019s very complicated project and very complicated initiative. ","And as you have heard us say many times in the past what we are hoping to achieve here not just with the cruise, with customs, with security, with inspections, with FRA all of those agencies have been supportive of what we are trying to do here. We are basically trying to replicate at the U.S.-Mexico border, the processes that exist today at the U.S.-Canadian border. ","So, that\u2019s\u2019 an important consideration, I think just so people on the phone don\u2019t think that we are trying to do something that\u2019s unprecedented here or just ridiculous in terms of being aggressive, we are just trying to replicate systems that already exists in other places.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey thanks good morning. I just want to come back to AMLO, I guess there was a comment early about the government getting sworn in at the end of the year but congress will be constituted on September 1st. So there is a possibility Marino could still get the two thirds Constitutional majority with some party realignments. They already have the 50% plus one of the local side. So how do you handicapped this outcome? Do you have any visibility to any changes that might be coming Congress aside from what we have already seen in the polls. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","No I mean nothing other than what we have heard in the messaging that has come from the leadership from AMLO himself and from his key advisors and transition team. I think our view is and Brian you guys got a pretty good resource capability that in Mexico so we get a lot of insight from your own people there a bit. ","He sort backed off some of the early promises or statements that he made about reversing energy reform and even in public infrastructure projects like the high-profile Mexico City airport. What he said recently as he is going to look more at the contracts and seems to be looking and shining a bright light on possible corruption that may be involved in energy and in airport or public works projects as opposed to just reversing course. ","He has said things about wanting to maintain a strong national energy entity. So making sure that PEMEX continues to exist and survive and be relevant but way short of saying things like he wants to reverse energy reform. So again based on what we have seen and the messaging that has come out of the administration it just doesn't seem like he has put constitutional reform at the top of his list. Jos\u00e9 anything to add to that?","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya","No just a confirmation of what you just said on the right conversations that we have had with his team. They have also assured to us that they will review some of the contracts, and that\u2019s not lucky for other things but to find out if there was some corruption from the contracts. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","You guys I think some of the data and the insights that we have gained overtime is coming from many of you on the call or your research capabilities that if he can really get at corruption there is - I have seen numbers recently that that could be two or three points of GDP for Mexico if he can really make a significant headway in reducing corruption and the economic drain that results from corruption.","I think he has announced the 40% reduction in his own compensation. And then because of the way the rules work in Mexico that will filter down to all other levels of government so austerity, corruption, security, those things really seem to be top of his agenda as opposed to any major changes in constitutional reform or economic policy.","But as is the case with all transitions in government, we will engage with the new leadership and we will stay very close to what is going on and try to make sure we are active in not only informing, but influencing the path forward.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks, Pat and Jose for the comments there. Just one quick follow up for Brian. Frac sand sourcing changes those topic for a while now but just take it from any specific if there are actually starting to see some declines in the Permian and some production impacts from all particularly capacity. So, maybe franchise is a bit different, but connected just wanted to get your updated thoughts on that as well. Thank you.","Brian Hancock","Yes. Brian, I would say that we concur with that we are starting to see sand coming in from other areas. Certainly our customers are using a lot of sand, but I would tell you there are some sourcing changes that are occurring in the market, we are not sure where they are actually going to land out, but certainly it\u2019s impacting the Permian Basin and we are seeing it.","So, I would concur with that, but we are, we still have a significant amount of sand moving and we are just stay close to it, but it looks like to me that we are going to have both brown and white sand use for quite a while in this area. So, that\u2019s where I would land on that.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ottensmeyer, I will turn the floor back to you for closing comments.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","All right. The Friday afternoon in July, I will go back to my suggested headlines for the quarter. Solid volume and revenue growth in most strategic growth areas particularly cross border growth, weakness in volume, we feel is really isolated primarily to energy some of which is crude oil timing and obviously coal which is pretty well understood. And we talked a lot about weakness in intermodal with some of which is intentional and thoughtful as we try to respond to changing market environment.","Second half outlook points to improve sequential growth in volume and revenue. In the long-term outlook, this is multiple oversize growth opportunities that we still feel very excited and enthusiastic about the longer-term outlook. So, feel free to use any of those headlines that you want and have a great weekend and we will talk to you all in 90 days. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions]","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may now begin.","David Starling","Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Kansas City Southern's third quarter 2015 earnings presentation.","Joining me for today's call are Pat Ottensmeyer, KCS President; Jeff Songer, Chief Transportation Officer; Brian Hancock, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Upchurch, Chief Financial Officer. And Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, our President and Executive Representative of KCSM will be available on the phone for questions from Mexico.","We're not blind to the fact that by adding Brian to our speakers list, we've made already pretty full speakers platform even more crowded. But don't worry, we have no intention of making our call this morning any longer.","But it is important that you have the opportunity to get to know Brian and start to get a sense of his vision for KCS sales and marketing function. We're extremely happy to have him as a part of our executive team, and I am sure you'll come to appreciate what he brings to the company.","In the interest of time, let me quickly turn for a brief overview of the third quarter. KCS revenues for the quarter declined by 7% from a year ago. However, when you exclude foreign exchange and the impact of lower fuel surcharge revenue, the picture looks considerably better, with revenues actually increasing 1% from the third quarter 2014.","Excluding impacts of foreign exchange and fuel surcharge revenue probably provides more accurate view of the current health of our business. While even 1% revenue growth isn't where we would like it to be, it illustrates that we have improved from the second quarter and that we're moving in the right direction.","KCS adjusted operating ratio for the third quarter came in at 65.2%, a 9 point improvement from last year. And while operating ratio is only one metric we use to evaluate our overall performance, the fact that we achieved margin improvement in the third quarter, despite experiencing a decline in volume, speaks to the strength of the KCS franchise and our ability to shape our operation to conform to business conditions.","Even though year-over-year our third quarter carloadings decreased 2% on a sequential basis, carloadings were up 9% over the second quarter. Without a doubt, seasonality plays into this. The third quarter is usually stronger than the second. But this year the 9% rate of growth was more than double what it was last year. This gives us further confidence that KCS's overall business is recovering rapidly.","And while two weeks do not make a quarter, the positive trend appears to be continuing in the fourth quarter. Finally, our service improvement steadily improved during the past quarter. And you can expect continued improvement, as we finish out the year. In a few minutes Jeff Songer will provide you with more background on our operations both in Mexico and in the U.S.","Now, let me turn it over to Pat.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I'll being my comments on Slide 7 of the presentation. I'm only going to touch on a few key points sort of a current state of the railroad and our view of the environment, in which we're operating. And Jeff Songer and Brian Hancock will provide more color on some of the specific areas that we know will be of a greater interest to the audience today.","As you saw earlier, revenues for the quarter were down 7% and a 2% reduction in volumes from 2014. If you recall from the second quarter earnings call back in July, we reported that the third quarter would be up sequentially and less worse than second quarter in terms of year-over-year comp. That's pretty much where we landed. As Dave mentioned, sequentially revenues and volumes were higher than the second quarter of 2015 by about 8% and 9%, respectively.","As you'll see on the following slide, volume so far in October continue to improve. And subject to ongoing uncertainty in energy markets, we feel good about the trajectory of demand as we head into the end of 2015. Through the close of business, Wednesday, average daily carloads for October were running about 1% higher than September and 1% higher than October of last year as well.","In spite of an improving pricing environment, revenue per unit during the quarter decreased by about 5%, which as you can see on the box in the upper right-hand side of the slide, was driven largely by reduced fuel surcharge revenue and negative foreign exchange impact caused by a deterioration in the peso.","In addition, we did take some pricing action during the quarter to improve demand for utility coal, given the low price for natural gas and unused capacity we had on certain parts of our network, which handle the coal volumes. This was done on a short-term basis with no service or capacity commitments, meaning that if demand for other commodities dictates, we can essentially regulate the amount of coal volume we handle under the short-term incentive arrangement to manage our overall revenue and yields.","Back to the core pricing environment, we saw continuation of the positive pricing trend that we have been reporting now for the last five quarters, with same-store sales increasing by about 4.1% from last year. The rate increase on contract renewals and extensions that actually took place during the quarter was also 4.1%.","In the interest of time, I am just going to touch on a couple of the business units, and Brian will get into more detail on energy, intermodal and automotive in a couple of minutes.","Strength in our chemical and petroleum business was driven by higher non-crude petroleum shipments and plastics as well as strong pricing. You can see that FX and fuel had a very powerful impact on revenue in this business unit during the quarter.","The weakness in our industrial and consumer business unit was really across the board in terms of commodity type, but the primary driver was metals and scrap. That weakness was driven by the same factors that we cited in the second quarter, which were reduced demand for drilling pipe and continued high level of the imports due to strong U.S. dollar. On the positive side, we saw a better than average pricing increases in our boxcar business, which should bode well for us in future periods.","Finally, our ag and mineral business units showed solid growth, driven primarily by grain and food products. Unlike some of the other rails, our export or cross-border grain demand continues to be strong with carloads increasing by about 4% versus last year. Just as a reminder, export grain, primarily to Mexico, in our case, represents about 58% of our total grain volumes and about a-third of our total ag and minerals business.","Moving on to Slide 8, we show you daily average carloads back to January of 2014, and you can see the positive momentum that we have experienced here over the last few months. Through October 14 or Wednesday of this week, average daily carloads have increased now for six consecutive months, and so far in October are higher than the previous year for the first time since January.","I will also say that this trend is pretty much across our entire portfolio of business with the exception of metals and scrap, where we continue to see weakness for the same reasons that I cited earlier.","The key point from this slide is at this moment, business demand still feels very good to us, with the obvious caveat about the uncertainty in energy markets, which you have seen across the entire rail sector, have made it more difficult to forecast demand and provide guidance.","For that reason, and just so you know when we get to the Q&A, we are not going to provide any revenue or volume guidance for 2016 on this call today. Brian will cover the outlook for the rest of 2015 in a few minutes.","Finally, moving on to Slide 9, I want to just touch briefly on the status of our recent service, resource and capacity issues that we discussed at some length on our second quarter call. Jeff Songer will cover this in greater detail in a moment.","But I would like to state that at this moment, we believe we have proper alignment of crews and locomotives on both sides of the border to handle current business volumes. Jeff will take you through recent performance metrics and you'll see noticeable trend line improvement over the last few months.","Does this means that our service levels are fully recovered and at exactly the level that we would like them to be? No. We still have crews that are completing training and not fully qualified. In addition, there are segments of our network where growth and demand have been sufficiently strong to require additional track capacity, including the project cited on Slide 9, in order to achieve optimal service levels and equipment cycles.","The punch line however is this, we no longer feel that these service issues, particularly crews in Mexico, are going to constrain our volumes and revenues going forward, as they have over the past two quarters.","With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Songer","Thank you, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with Slide 11, rapidly growing interchange volumes and June and July maintenance curfews in the Kansas City interchange region impacted early quarter performance.","Sequential volume at the Kansas City interchange increased roughly 80% in Q3 versus Q2. Putting this in perspective, the 2014 sequential increase for this interchange volume was about 13%. Coal recovery from Q2 levels and the increase in crude oil were the main drivers for this volume.","Last quarter I referenced peak furlough of 8% and peak locomotive storage at 12%. In Q3 we restored all north end crews to service and have placed all, but a few locomotives back in service. While we believe the actions to suspend resources in Q2 this year were prudent, given the business outlook at that time, we lost a few crews who did not return to work after furlough and incurred time and expense placing locomotives back into service. Overall, I am pleased with the operational and cost control performance given the large swings in volume we have seen this year.","U.S. service rebounded in September as resources were realigned with volumes and October month-to-date velocity in the U.S. is back over 27 miles per hour. Regarding capacity, we have restarted projects in the Kansas City area that were put on hold early in the year. These projects will provide for additional terminal capacity and allow for more efficient mechanical inspections of grain and crude equipment.","Turning briefly to cars online, we have experienced a year-over-year increase in our cars online. The majority of this increase is related to tank cars and coal cars to support the energy volumes and grain cars to support that business.","Additionally, as our two online origins for grain continue to grow, a greater percentage of our grain fleet remains online versus interchanging with connecting carriers. We will continue to manage other car types according to projected volumes and will look for opportunities to control cost in our intermodal and automotives fleets, while balancing business needs and service levels.","Turning to Slide 12, Mexico performance has focused on regaining consistency in our terminals and line-of-road. As Pat mentioned, we have achieved our hiring goal for 2015 and we continue to train and promote yard positions to road engineers and conductors.","Dwell has remained stable and should continue to show improvement due early 2016 supported by the first phase of our Sanchez Yard expansion, which is on schedule to open in December. This expansion will not only help Sanchez, but continue to improve terminal operations at Nuevo Laredo and Monterrey. Work will continue at Sanchez in 2016 with the addition of classification tracks and mechanical support facilities.","While, we have not yet achieved normal levels in our velocity, we continue to work in those areas most affecting performance. As mentioned, yard crews are training to become road engineers and conductors. This process will continue through Q1 2016. We are also in the process of working with our union on our 2016 hiring plan to ensure we have adequate crews to meet volume demand and attrition.","Additional capacity projects due to come online in Q4 with signings in our Central region will help fluidity in that area and we will continue to invest in the areas of L\u00e1zaro and line-of-road capacity in the Central and Southern regions.","I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock.","Brian Hancock","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure being part of the KCS organization and I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our third quarter results.","To begin, as noted earlier, carloadings were down 2% year-over-year with revenues increasing by 1% when adjusted for fuel and exchange rate impact. Rather than reporting some of the commodity groups that Pat mentioned, I'll concentrate on a few areas for which you probably have been questions.","As you can see on Slide 14, our intermodal volumes were down 6% from 2014. The primary reasons were the service interruptions felt by our customers in the second quarter and the unfavorable exchange rate, which resulted in some volume moving to truck, as it became a more viable option.","As Jeff discussed earlier, to a larger extent, the service issues were resolved during Q3 and we expect gradual improvement in our intermodal business, as some of the volume that left the railroad earlier in the year returns during Q4 and into 2016.","The L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas cross-border business continued to show strength in Q3 and we're continuing to see that trend in Q4. Going into 2015, our cross-border intermodal represented less than 2% of our total L\u00e1zaro intermodal business. It's grown to about 9% now and we look for the volumes to grow further with the opening of the new APMT container terminal in 2016.","In terms of our U.S. intermodal business, we're already receiving favorable comments from our intermodal asset partners regarding our new Wylie Texas intermodal terminal. One customer noted that their trucks were getting in and out of the terminal in under 15 minutes. That kind of service should boost utilization and be a positive selling point in growing our U.S. intermodal business.","Overall, we expect our intermodal franchise to continue to be a driver of growth as customers experience the positive impact of our service improvements, the new Wylie intermodal facility and the APMT terminal.","Slide 15 provides a summary of our automotive business. As discussed previously the service issues earlier in the year resulted in lower volumes and in some cases force our customers to find short-term alternative capacity to move finished vehicle. We're also starting to see the impact of lower fuel prices on the compact and mid-size market KCS supports out of Mexico. As fuel prices decrease, consumers typically trend towards purchasing larger vehicles and light-duty trucks.","In addition, this slide also points to the fact that the first part of 2016 will be impacted by significant retooling efforts by our domestic automatic manufacturers. These plants are scheduled to be down for several months in early 2016, but the good news is we believe the retooling and expansions will result in significant volume growth for KCS, which we will begin to see in the back half of 2016.","I would also like to spend just a moment on the VW plant in Puebla. Earlier this month, industry news suggested that planned investments in all parts of the VW network would be reevaluated based on their recent issues regarding their diesel vehicles. Historically, Puebla has represented about 10% of our total finished vehicle volume. We've already seen a slight decrease in the production from this facility. And the industry news also suggests the company-wide cost cutting measures, which could potentially impact production at a number of the facilities.","We are in continuous discussions with VW and we'll continue to support this important customer. If the Puebla plant experiences substantial production cutbacks, we will redirect the use of the excess automotive equipments to support the other plants in our Mexican automotive customer base. Before leaving the automotive discussion, I'd like to reemphasize that KCS is looking ahead to very meaningful growth in this business.","By 2017, the GM and Chrysler ramp up should be in full force, Audi and Kia will be approaching full production, and then comes Mercedes, Infiniti, Toyota and BMW. Furthermore, we believe there will be additional manufacturing capacity added over the next five years. We continue to feel very good about our automotive franchise being a long-term growth driver for KCS.","Finally, in the energy segment, we saw strength with both utility coal and crude oil shipments. The peak cooling system resulted in KCS achieving good sequential coal carloading growth in the third quarter. As Pat noted, we also took advantage of excess capacity to provide a coal customer with some fixed variable contract options, which allowed the customer to keep its generating units online and take more coal in the third quarter than they had originally been forecasted. And Pat also mentioned, the deal we agreed to, does not commit KCS to any service guarantees.","We expect crude oil shipments to continue to be highly variable as the Mayan\/WCS spreads continue to fluctuate. During Q3, we saw strength in these shipments as Canadian crew moved into the U.S. Gulf region. We believe we will continue to see production at existing facilities continue to grow into the future. We'd, however, experienced lower than planned frac sand volumes and we do not foresee of recovery in these shipments in the short-term.","Finally, on Page 17, we provide our fourth quarter sequential outlook for each of the commodity groups. We're forecasting the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter, which is positive, given that we usually feel slight drop off in Q4. In addition, there maybe some upside potential with some of our commodities like utility coal, crude oil, petroleum and plastic, we'll just have to see how that turns out.","Given the complex macro environment, especially with respect to energy, volumes for a number of our commodities will likely continue to be highly volatile in the near-term. This will provide us with opportunities and challenges. Nevertheless, the general trend appears positive as we move towards 2016.","And with that, I'll turn the presentation over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Michael Upchurch","Thanks Brian, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 19, third quarter volumes declined 2% and revenue declined 7%. As Pat indicated earlier, we saw a significant negative impact on our revenue growth rate from declining fuel prices and the peso depreciation, combining these factors negatively impacted revenues by $55 million or 8 percentage points. Adjusting for fuel and foreign currency, revenues would have increased by about 1%.","Our operating ratio improved 90 basis points to 65.2%, reflecting the benefit of lower expenses and increased pricing. Sequentially, incremental margins were strong 72% on revenue growth of 8%, while expenses only increased 3%.","Reported 3Q 2015 EPS was $1.20 per share, while adjusted EPS was $1.21, down 6% from third quarter a year ago. In addition to declining operating income, we experienced increased interest expense of $4 million, impacting EPS by approximately $0.02 in the quarter, as a result of the July debt offering.","I'll comment more about that in a few slides. And for your convenience, we have also included the additional income statement detail from the appendix, including foreign currency and income tax impacts.","On Slide 20, operating expenses declined 8%, driven largely by foreign exchange impact and lower U.S. fuel prices. Lower incentive compensation expense and benefits in purchased services from a mechanical maintenance contract restructuring, also benefited year-over-year expense comparisons. While offsetting, we had higher depreciation from capital investments, wage inflation, increased car hire, litigation costs and increases in Mexico fuel prices. I'll cover more details in certain key expense categories on the following slide.","So starting on Page 21, compensation expense declined $12 million or nearly 10%. Lower year-over-year incentive compensation expense of $10 million is due to increased incentive accruals booked a year ago in the third quarter, while 2015 incentive accruals remain at much lower payout percentages. Also, experienced a $7 million benefit due to foreign exchange.","Offsetting those declines were increases due to wage inflation and incremental headcount. Overall, quarterly average headcount was up 220 FTE or 3%, and was mainly in our operations group. Our third quarter average headcount increased 260 in Mexico, largely due to the result of our efforts to improve our service levels, offset by 40 a FTE decline in our U.S. labor force.","On Page 22, our fuel expense declined $30 million or 28%. During the quarter, we benefited from lower fuel prices in the U.S. specifically $1.73 per gallon compared to $2.93 a gallon during the third quarter of 2014. However, in Mexico, on a constant currency basis, we saw a 4% increase in fuel prices from $3.29 to $3.43 per gallon. Mexico began eliminating the monthly price increases earlier this year, and since then we have seen stability in our Mexican fuel price. And finally, our fuel lag benefit during the quarter was $5 million all from our U.S. operation.","Finally, on Slide 23, let me address our cash flow priorities. We continue to generate positive free cash flows despite significant capital investments to support our growth opportunities. For 2015, we still believe our capital investments will be approximately $650 million to $670 million, the range we communicated during the first quarter earnings call.","Our next priority will be to continue to provide our shareholders a meaningful return as we have since 2012. Our annual dividend has steadily increased 69%, since we established the dividend in 2012, and will provide $144 million back to shareholders in 2015.","Additionally, in May of this year, our Board of Directors approved a $500 million stock repurchase program to be funded through cash flows available liquidity and incremental debt. In July, we did issue $500 million in a new 30-note at 4.95% to repay commercial paper and begin repurchasing our shares. And I might just note that we would expect our 2015 interest expense to be approximately $80 million and for 2016 approximately $95 million.","During the quarter, we opportunistically repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares in an average price of $93.57. Including the second quarter purchases, we have now repurchased a total of $136 million of our stock for almost 1.5 million shares at an average price of $93.44.","Finally, we intend to maintain a prudent capital structure to keep our investment grade rating. We continue to believe we have some incremental opportunities to purchase leased equipment and lower our overall equipment costs.","Since 2011, we have increased our percentage ownership of rolling stock from less than 20%-owned in 2011 to now over 60% at the end of the third quarter. This has allowed us to save approximately $56 million annually in equipment expenses and improve our OR by over 200 basis points. Our target leverage ratio continues to be in low-2s giving us ample flexibility without jeopardizing our credit rating.","And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave.","David Starling","Thanks Mike. On balance, we're very pleased with the progress we've made in the third quarter, both commercially and operationally. We still have work to do, but we're more confident than ever that we'll be in good shape at the end of this quarter. And we look forward to ending 2015 on a strong note.","We'll now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Amit Shah","This is Amit Shah calling in for Allison actually. In terms of the temporary pricing actions you took in the coal business, should we think of this as a one-off or do you see opportunities in other parts of the network to implement similar incentives to improve demand intensity?","David Starling","I would say, right now, considering a one-off; again, as we saw in the second quarter, our coal volumes were extremely weak, creating this opportunity for excess capacity. But I would say, that at this point we see it as a one-off situation.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities.","Matt Troy","I wanted to ask about coal, specifically, you've had one customer that's been problematic, I know you took some pricing actions during the quarter, but is there anything you can do longer-term to mitigate the volatility in this commodity group. It's been kind of a rollercoaster for the last couple of years.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I don't think so, Matt. I think that's one of the things that we talk a lot about here is when you look at the coal, crude, and even grain to some extent, because of droughts and floods, there is just a lot of our business now that -- a more of our business, and not just us, all the rails that is commodity-based and going to be more volatile. So there are things certainly we can do longer term in terms of pricing and making sure that we're getting an adequate return.","I think the volatility in some of this business is just going to be a fact of life going forward, and we just are going to continue to find ways to deal with that. Makes it difficult from a long-term capital investment program, but that's where pricing and yield management strategies are going to become more important.","Matt Troy","I get it. I was just referring more to that one specific customer, which seems to be a thorn in this side of the business, but I understand. I guess my follow-up would be just Mexico, you said the resources are there on a headcount basis. Just curious what the efficiency curve is there, as we look forward over the next couple of quarters?","And when you expect those people to be and those resources to being self actualizing? And does it change the actions you had to take, both hiring and the pay levels? Does it change the margin profile of the Mexican business in the near to intermediate term or structure, should we think about it being similar to what it has been historically?","Jeffrey Songer","The last part your question, does it change the margin or outlook? No, we're becoming more fluid. And as these crews come on, I think Dave mentioned last quarter that we'll probably find ourselves a little fat on crews, but what that will do is set us up for good to be able to handle attrition getting into 2016, so there's not this need again to have such a large hiring class, as we saw in 2015.","We've got all the -- we've talked about a 250 number for 2015. We've got those guys hired on board. Everyday those guys, the promotions, trainings, they've progressed from yard operations to road crews. So as I referenced, we'll see that continue through Q1 here in '16, but everyday those guys are kind of marking up in the areas we need them.","So again, you've got the base on board. You've got everybody focused in the right direction getting those guys out, whether they are needed around the systems. So I'm feeling good about certainly the resource level in Mexico we're at.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, Matt, I might just add, on a short-term basis, obviously there will be some incremental compensation expense associated with the hires, but we would certainly hope to see that offset with incremental volumes and revenues and margin from revenue.","David Starling","In the last quarter or two, we talked about the new agreement to run the longer train, so we actually expect to get some efficiencies out of the new 9,000 foot train length over the long-term.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","So I know, Pat, that you're not going to give us volume and revenue guidance for 2016, I understand that, but I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of the automotive comments, just in terms of, it sounds like there are a couple of headwinds that would affect 2016. So when we think about first half, should we be modeling auto volumes maybe that are down, or are you just saying, don't get too aggressive on the pace of auto volume growth. So I'm trying to ask you to be too specific, but just kind of directionally, how do we think about automotive going into '16?","Brian Hancock","When you think about 2016, obviously, the retooling efforts on some of the domestic companies is going to have a pretty significant impact on the first part of the year. So I would certainly suggest that that's taken into account. What I would tell you, though, is we have a number of different facilities that are continuing to retool and then come online.","And so as we see it, we feel very comfortable that we're going to be, on a total year basis, very much the same as this year, but I would also tell you that that first piece of the year, especially around the domestics as they retool and as they look at the new models, that will definitely have an impact.","Now, obviously all of those things are subject to change, as they need to make different changes in their models and as they respond to some of the market forces that are occurring in the automotive industry right now. But that's kind of way I would look at it.","Tom Wadewitz","So when you say, total year the same, you're saying kind of volume flat on a full year basis?","Brian Hancock","Yes, we would say that our total year volumes are going to be similar to 2016 from an automotive perspective, when you think about the entirety of the year.","Tom Wadewitz","And then one on L\u00e1zaro, the volume growth was really strong in second quarter in L\u00e1zaro, and then it did slowed a bit in third, I think you commented on this some, but just wanted to see if you could give a little more perspective on whether you expect that to accelerate? And is there an issue in terms of slowing Mexico economy that are hurting L\u00e1zaro volume?","Brian Hancock","I would say that the L\u00e1zaro volume, as I said in my comments, really slowed, because of the service issues we experienced in Q2. Now, different shippers make different decisions as they move through the year. And now that those issues are behind us we are continuing -- we have many of our customers who have a desire to move rail, but they are not going to be able to switch immediately, and so we expect over the next certainly 90 days, but into 2016, as well, for those volumes to start to return. But obviously the competition is stiff and we need to make sure that we have a great product.","And I believe that just Jeff has really rolled out what we have done to make our service and other things very competitive. So we feel comfortable that we will continue to se steady volume coming back into our intermodal businesses, especially at L\u00e1zaro, it's just our product we believe is the right product right now.","David Starling","And you've got to remember too the opening of APMT terminal in the middle of the year is going to unconstrain L\u00e1zaro from a port standpoint.","Brian Hancock","That will be in July; is the plan for that to occur July 2016 for the APMT terminal.","David Starling","And we're very encouraged by the growth in our cross-border.","Tom Wadewitz","So you sound like you're still pretty upbeat on L\u00e1zaro growth. Looking forward, it just maybe a bit of a bump in third quarter?","Brian Hancock","Absolutely.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","And I would just say the same thing with autos. I mean the things that are going on the retoolings that Brian talked about, long-term those are going to be positive for us. In the short run, while those plans are under the retooling process, they're going to take some volume away, but longer term, this just continues to strengthen our auto business.","Operator","Our next question is coming from line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.","Chris Wetherbee","I wanted to touch a little bit on peso and FX, as you guys think about sort of the pricing environment in Mexico, maybe how that could be impacting pricing? And then maybe thinking about sort of competitiveness in intermodal and auto, specifically, have there been any issues in terms of that headwind that we're seeing from FX? Just want to get a sense of how that's going to play-in out in Mexico?","Michael Upchurch","I would say, as Brian mentioned this in his comments, first, that was a bit of a factor. I think it was difficult to sort out over the last few months as we saw some of our intermodal volumes going to truck. How much of it was service? How much of it was peso? So we just can't precisely answer that question.","We know that we have gotten some inquiries, and for the lack of a better word, I guess, pressure from some of our ocean carrier customers over the last several months, who are looking at trucking options from L\u00e1zaro that are peso denominated. But if you look at our performance at L\u00e1zaro, I don't think we can say for certain that the peso weakness has cost us a lot of volume, we're still growing. But it's something that we're keeping our eyes on.","So looking back, I don't feel that the peso exchange rate has had an impact on our pricing environment in Mexico. And it's really hard to say with any degree of confidence or precision that it's cost us business. But certainly something that we're looking at just in terms of what it means for a lot of different things in Mexico that could affect our business.","We get questions, and I'm sure you're looking at the grain business, export grain is a big part of our business and that's all dollar based. So the strength of the dollar, the weakness of the peso are going to cost us in terms of Mexico sourcing grain from other markets. We haven't seen it yet, but it's certainly something that we're paying attention to.","Not a very specific answer to your question, but it's something we're watching closely and obviously it's outside of our control. But so far, we don't feel that it's had a big impact on our business.","David Starling","Just to give you a little more color on the intermodal side, the only advantage in not price. I mean people like the stack service. It does provide better security. So there are some other benefits that the customers look at. They can move their empties back to vessel, all in big unit trains. So there is other advantages.","And on the grain side, if you think about what we do for the major customers in Mexico, we're actually part of a logistics chain. We run the 100 car trains in their facilities. Some of these guys are making corn syrup. They got have their product there. They've got to have it on time. And the quality from rail is always better than the vessel, because every time you rehandle grain, you loose some quality.","And we have a better more reliable service to those customers than they can get by trying to come into vessel. Because remember, if it comes in by vessel, it's still going to move by rail. It still got to get unloaded, move to rail, and then still moved into their facilities. So we offer more advantages than just price.","Chris Wetherbee","And then just a quick follow-up, sort of looking at your slide that goes through the sequential changes in carloads for the fourth quarter. It would seem with sort of almost 70% in the neutral to favorable dynamic that you might be able to see sort of positive carload sustain through the fourth quarter. Just want to get a rough sense, if there is anything else I should be thinking about, when I am looking at that slide in that context?","Brian Hancock","We absolutely feel very comfortable that the fourth quarter is going to continue the same trajectory that we have in the third quarter. And we don't see anything out there that's going to change that volume.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, Chris, just to remember seasonality obviously from thanksgiving to the end of the year, things do slow down.","Operator","Our next question is coming from line of John Barnes with RBC.","John Barnes","First, on the Mexican hiring, again, just going back, I know you talked about having completed what you need to do now. But as you look at growth going forward in Mexico, how do you ensures that you kind of stay up on this, so you don't have a repeat of this issue, especially given where kind of the union felt down in terms of the pools of applicants available to you?","Jeffrey Songer","We're just staying in front it. And we've already got several requests in for personnel for our 2016 plan. We're working towards that. As I mentioned, I think we'll be a little fat, when service restores. So again, as we lose people through normal attrition, you're already going to have a stronger baseline in place.","So the union relationship continues to foster. And again, we're doing things, they're showing support now, we've got names flowing. So I don't see a big issue for us. It's just to make sure we're staying ahead of it. And right now I feel that that we're doing that.","John Barnes","And then going through some of your comments, you talked specifically I think in your slide deck, you said something to the effect of kind of an expectation of a delayed peak season on the intermodal side this time. Can maybe you talk a little bit about why you think we're seeing a delay? And I hate to be that sort of short-term focused, but given some of the freight-related data points, unfortunately we would kind of have to be right now.","Brian Hancock","No, that's no problem. This is Brian. John, basically what that comment is about is based on year-over-year comparisons and what we got from our vessel operators, the intermodal volume that came in was delayed about two weeks, and so we saw it a little bit later. It's certainly not a large delay, but we're already right in the middle or through that peak.","So we feel very comfortable that we kind of timed it right, knew when it was, but it just was not. Sometimes that shows up in that last week of the third quarter, depending on the way the retailers and others are bringing products into the ports. So we feel like we time that very well and we're already into that and through a part of that week.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Can I just get a clarification, Brian, on the port of L\u00e1zaro, is that a six-month delay on the opening of the second concession? I thought originally it was suppose to open by the end of 2015, so we were looking for a solid growth through the '16?","Brian Hancock","No, no. They are right on-time and we're looking for an early July. There have been articles written that some of it may move as early as May, but we are still looking for an opening of that terminal in mid-July 2016 and that's been the same for number.","David Starling","No. One thing they've talked about is what they call a soft opening.","Brian Hancock","Soft opening.","David Starling","Where they get their equipment and they test their equipment. The government has to come in and certify everything. So what they are talking about by mid-year is been fully operational. That might be some of the confusion.","Ken Hoexter","And thoughts on Port Arthur development, is that stalling, given what's going on with crude prices or is Global going full steam on that? What are your thoughts on your development there and what you need to invest in preparation for that?","Brian Hancock","Right now, all of the development that we've got going on in Port Arthur, especially with the Global Group is going on as planned. All of the different things that are being done with the permits and working with the government and all the different things that have to be done are right on schedule. We feel very comfortable that that is going to move forward just like we think and we'll be ready in 2017.","David Starling","In terms of your second part of your question, Ken, about the capital, because this is still two-plus years out, we really aren't doing anything today to anticipate that facility. But we certainly have plans looking at some options for expansion and ways we can improve, not just because of Global, but the overall Port Arthur\/Beaumont Nederland market, things that we are starting to plan for 2016 and 2017 that will help us in that region.","But right now, they are deep into the permitting process. We've had very active and ongoing dialog with Global and in fact some of the customers that they are trying to secure longer-term commitments. So everything is going pretty much as scheduled as Brian mentioned.","Ken Hoexter","And if I could just get a quick clarification from Jeff, because it sounded like, as Mexico really starts to pick up the pace, you talked about getting fat. What kind of visibility do you need in order to, if volumes, I guess, slow down to then cull or can you keep staying ahead if volumes do pick up the pace? Because it seemed like the last two weeks we've seen a great improvement in velocity. I just want to see if that's a trend that you think continues here or your thoughts on that recent improvement?","Jeffrey Songer","Yes. And why I've separated Mexico and U.S., again, I think the velocity you saw mainly for the last few weeks has really been around the U.S. side. And again, I think we're operating even near 28 in the last few days. So, again, the message is U.S. is stable and we're back to performing pretty close to where we historically have.","U.S., again, the velocity side is still lagging a bit. But the crew is coming on. The capacity is the other thing I really haven't touched on. The benefits we're going to get out of Sanchez. That means fluidity on that whole north end. It's not Sanchez and the terminal below that's going to help process cross-border and fluidity to and the central region as well.","We've got some of the capacity projects coming online here yet in Q4 for the southern region for the quarter out of L\u00e1zaro, one additional siding and some siding extensions. So adding all that together, we should just continue to help promote and get us back to kind of normal production.","David Starling","Let me help kind of put a nail in this, because this question keeps coming up. We have reset our relationship with the union. The head of the union with his main players was up there three weeks ago for Royals game. We are all working together. He has made announcements in front of his union team that we got to work with the railroad. They're spending a lot of money on capital. They're a good company. They're concerned about our safety. We have to make sure that we move the freight, that's our obligation.","We have, as you know, from a couple of years ago, a new director, the Senior VP of HR who has a lot more labor experience. So we have totally redone the relationship we have with the union, and we are not having any problems with them, getting employees to hire.","We improved that elongated process we had from physicals to approvals, to security checks. So we feel that is fixed and it is as efficient as the U.S. So we will regulate crews like we have done in the U.S., and we will do it very efficiently. So we do not see that as being a problem in the future.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long","First question I had on the pricing environment, it remained strong this year, despite the volume decline we've seen year-to-date. Could you just comment on the sustainability of the increases that you're seeing? And just in your opinion, is there anything that would get you more concerned about pricing potentially weakening as we head into 2016?","Brian Hancock","Well, we see, as we've talked about in the presentation is, right now 4.1 very strong. We don't have anything on the horizon that we would say would deteriorate that pricing environment.","Based on Jeff's comments and the amount of capacity we have within the system and our ability to move the freight now with all of the different things that have been put in place operationally, we feel very comfortable that we're in the right side of the pricing environment and we continue to see that into the future.","Obviously, that can change as others make different choices. But right now in our world, we feel very comfortable that we're in a good space from a pricing perspective.","Justin Long","And as a follow-up, you talked a lot about the headcount situation in Mexico, but if we just look at overall headcount for the business and think about next year, could you provide any high-level thoughts? Just assume we return to a low-to-mid single-digit volume growth environment, how would you anticipate headcount would need to trend in that scenario?","Jeffrey Songer","Again, we'll manage that as we've done in U.S., and that's why we continue to talk about these separately. As we've shown in the U.S., certainly going from a furlough of 8%-plus of workforce back to basically fully staffed. We'll just have to manage that. And I think we've shown we can manage that, as volume trend.","So that's something that, as we illustrate, there is a little bit of a lag effect as we see volumes increase and decrease on a rapid basis. But as things, the outlook continue to stabilize, I think you'll just manage that headcount as appropriately with the volumes.","Michael Upchurch","Our longstanding goal has been to try to keep headcount increases below volume increases. Obviously, we're in a tough environment here in 2015 with volumes declining and some service issues. But I think you should expect us to continue to have those goals going forward over the long run. We just need to kind of work through the situation on a temporary basis.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.","Tyler Brown","Jeff, just thanks for the detail on the KCSM, the KCSR dwell and velocity, I thought that's very helpful. But I'm just curious if you could give us some details on train lengths. Basically I'm curious as the concession from the union has helped improve that metric or if it takes longer to kind of implement that into your train design.","Jeffrey Songer","It will be something, again, we graduate into. We are running some trains longer coming out of L\u00e1zaro and you're seeing that, you're seeing that in some other territories. The other thing we'll continue to just make sure our plan coincides with how and what we want to run length-wise.","Some of the other efforts you'll see going on into the future with siding, spacing and siding extensions is going to allow that flexibility to continue to grow. So certainly something I think is going to be a positive. We're already seeing that from our train length increases. And I think that's something I'll continue to focus on and we'll continue to get benefit here going forward.","Tyler Brown","And then just maybe a question for Brian or Pat, but I was just wondering if you could give us an update maybe on where we are in terms of the lane awards for those new auto plants in Mexico. Curious, if you're seeing kind of what you would expect from a share basis? And then also are you seeing any awards north of the border?","Brian Hancock","What I would tell you from a lane award, we're not going talk specifically about customers, but we feel like we are getting absolutely our share of that as well as being very competitive on other things that we're participating in. We feel very comfortable that we're going to come up in a very good space from an automotive perspective, as the new plans come on. On the north of the border, it's similar to what we have right now both on the southbound side parts. But no, we do not have anything north of the border to report other than what we currently move.","Tyler Brown","And then if I could just squeeze a very quick one. And this is a bit of an esoteric question, but what percent of your business is moving in boxcar?","David Starling","We'll have to get back to you.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","We'll have to get back to you on this one.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.","Bascome Majors","Looking at your chart, the intermodal volumes, they've been down year-over-year in each months since May, but you saw pretty encouraging narrowing of that gap over the last four weeks relative to last year. I'm just curious based on what you're hearing from some of your intermodal partners, who have temporarily moved some of your business to truck, when do you think we can return to consistent year-over-year growth in intermodal?","Brian Hancock","I think when you think about intermodal, it is a product that is sold, is very cyclical in its nature. There is also a piece of it that comes in with the shipping lines. We feel very comfortable now that the service issues are behind us, have been resolved, that we'll start to see that come in. Obviously, this is a heavy shipping period, and those commitments have already been made from the shipping lines. So as they get through their holiday, retail timing, we expect that to start to come back in later here in the quarter and then into 2016.","So it's not all going to come back at once. We understand that. But we do feel that the new service, they're going to start to see the service, they're going to see the benefit of the Wylie, Texas yard, how quickly people are moving in and out of that yard, and also the additional trains that we put on, the additional train length that Jeff talked about. So a lot of positive things, a lot of great feedback from our shipping partners, and so we feel very comfortable moving into 2016, that is going to be a positive space for us.","Bascome Majors","And just want to circle back to the success you had in stimulating some of the coal demand with the fixed variable adjustment on pricing. Is this Powder River Basin coal where you've done that?","David Starling","Yes. All of our coal is Powder River Basin coal.","Bascome Majors","So just extending from that, is this a holistic adjustment through the supply chain from Wyoming to the customer or is this just something that you've done on your side?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","A little bit of both. I'd say more of the former, because obviously, it's not a move that originates and terminate on KCS, so there is another carrier involved. So I would say, it's more of the former. It's a complete -- the incentive is for the full move. In most cases, depending on the location of utility, the majority of the line haul move would not be on KCS.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","So I think you said, kind of you're guiding to flattish sequential volume third quarter to fourth quarter, which implies like a couple of percent of volume growth year-over-year. I would think that's an environment where you can grow earnings. Just kind of make sure I'm not missing anything the way we're thinking there.","Michael Upchurch","Grow earnings on a year-over-year basis or?","Scott Group","Yes, if volumes are up a couple of percent, as you're expecting, I would think you can grow earnings?","Michael Upchurch","Yes, we're not, as Pat indicated, not guiding to anything specific, but you can certainly conclude that with incremental volume, and as you know Scott, I indicated we had some pretty strong incremental margins of 70% plus.","Scott Group","Just want to follow-up on the question on the competitive dynamic. Conceptually, do you think about changing some of the truck competitive business that's priced in dollars and to pesos to kind of avoid some of this competitive issue? And then, can you talk about that competitive dynamic with Ferromex and what it's look like they are doing it? And how that impacts your volume and pricing expectations for next year as well?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I would say, it doesn't really affect our volume and pricing per se, we haven't really seen any change in behavior in terms of the competitive landscape in Mexico. We know that they are teaming up with U.S. railroad to be more aggressive in some of the Intermodal markets that we feel very good about our service, and the service we have, the joint-line service with the UP on some of that premium intermodal and automotive business, very service sensitive.","We feel like, we have the best product and the best service and it's been in place for more than ten years. So we think we can compete and defend that part of the market, as they try to get more aggressive. And I think the awards and the dialogues we're having with customers has supported that view.","So on the other hand, we are on our toes, and feel, that if we continue to provide the kind of service we really feel that because we own the railroad on both sides of the border that there is a real advantage to the way we can face the customer. And we hear that constantly from our customer base.","So we feel very good about our ability to retain and grow that part of the business. But we need to be on our toes and make sure that our service, consistency and reliability of our services is as good as it can be to defend and grow that business. But Scott, we haven't seen any predatory pricing on the FXE's part, if that's your question.","Michael Upchurch","In fact, some have been talking about that aspect, but when you look at the auto results, I mean their auto results were down further than ours were in the third quarter. So there is certainly no share going to FXE there.","David Starling","The growth on the auto that they have enjoyed has been on plants that they serve exclusively, like Hermosillo, because they've had strong production, so they've enjoyed that. But we haven't seen them buying any market share, if that's your question.","Scott Group","And then just on the peso dollar question.","Michael Upchurch","Can you restate that question?","Scott Group","Yes, on the business that is competitive with trucks, do you think it makes sense conceptually to put more of that priced in pesos, so you don't have this currency discrepancy?","Michael Upchurch","No. Again, we don't feel -- I mean, we can't really point to and come to the conclusion that we lost share because of the exchange rate. Again, the ocean carriers where this is mostly -- where it would be an issue, their business is dollar base for the most part. So while they certainly have truck options, there is an unlimited tuck capacity in and out of L\u00e1zaro.","And there are a lot of advantages to rail, unrelated, as Dave mentioned, to price and currency, so again, something that we watch closely. We don't feel that its cost us market share. L\u00e1zaro's continued to grow. So it certainly hasn't affected our growth rates in and out of L\u00e1zaro. And it's important for us, as we've talked forever to maintain that balance in peso revenues and cost, so that we have that sort of natural income statement hedge. And at this point, we see that continuing to be the case.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Eric Morgan","This is Eric Morgan on for Brandon I just want to come back to grain real quick. Your outlook is pretty positive. You've recently talked about moving some out of storage in advance of the strong harvest. And just really on the comments on the export business, that seems to not have taken as much of a hit from FX. Is there a precedent for the export business having a less sensitivity to FX movements specifically compared to some of your peers?","Brian Hancock","I think the difference is ours is a normal export into Mexico, whereas others sometimes are exporting into Asia. Ours is a little, like Dave mentioned kind of almost a service-based product, if you will, where their plants depend on the consistency and things that we provide. And we are much more consistent with that volume than maybe some of our other competitors.","And primarily, it is the moves down to Mexico and then also the moves back this way. So it's something that's historically a normal thing for our railroad. And we feel very comfortable that that's going to continue. And especially in today's environment where you have a strong harvest, it's been a great quarter and we see that going continuing into the future.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","If you look back over the last several years, there has been fluctuation in peso dollar rate. We have never seen currency be a major driver in where the ultimate customers that we're serving source grain. We've seen a little bit of grain coming in from South America recently, but it really isn't a significant shift in the way Mexican sources corn.","Mexico sources corn only during the drought years, did we see where there just was no corn available in the U.S., did see any kind of a sizable shift. But once we got the crop back and the inventory back, the U.S. business came back pretty quickly. Now, is that going to be the case going forward? We've seen a fairly high degree of peso deterioration here for some period of time, so that's an unknown. But we just haven't seen our grain business be terribly dependent on the exchange rate.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.","James Allen","It's James Allen on for Brian Ossenbeck. We were wondering about your cross-border intermodal grain and whether it's leading to an imbalance of equipment heading out of Mexico? And if so, how and when you need to remedy to maintain growth rates?","David Starling","I'll take this as an old ocean guy. Basically it's fairly balanced, and we've always maintained the return of the equipment back into Mexico. So I don't quite really understand totally the question. But no, we don't see any changes from what we've had in recent years. So everything is operating as it always has.","James Allen","Again, and maybe as a follow-up to a Tom's question. Aside from infrastructure investments in Mexico, what are your expectations for the overall economy there?","David Starling","I'm sorry.","Michael Upchurch","Question is about the economy in Mexico. I think, Mexico ends up being fairly tightly linked with the U.S. economy, given the amount of goods that end up going north into the U.S. But they've done a really good job managing their overall inflation rate, which is now running below 2%, unemployment is below 5%.","We've seen a little softness in the auto production, but some of their manufacturing, labor indexes and business condition surveys, all look reasonably good. But again, I think they are largely linked to the U.S. economy. So they move as, as we move here in the U.S. And as you know in the U.S., it's been kind of one step forward and I have to step back.","Operator","Our next question is from the line Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Jeff Kauffman","As we look out, let's go beyond 2016 and kind of take the three to five year view. Mexican economy holding in there, currency in theory should be good for export, but energy is going to hurt the economy, auto has been a little soft. Would you look at the capital spending of $650 million to $670 million, how much of that is just regular maintenance away and what you'd consider kind of maintenance level CapEx? How much of it is, let's say, bucket two is improving existing operations, whether it's U.S. or Mexico and how much of it is new investment to accommodate growth we don't have?","David Starling","Well, historically if you look at it on a percentage basis, we've been at around 10% to 11% of capital has been maintenance. As we've improved our network that's gradually dropping down into the 10% range, maybe the 9.5% in outgoing years. The rest of it is all driven by IT equipment purchases, ETC locomotive purchases and adding capacity in the infrastructures. So that kind of gives you your breakout.","While auto may be down a bit this year, we're still looking long-term at a lot of growth coming out of Mexico on automotive. I mean all these new plans that are planned that are being built, that's definitely going to increase the production. You got to remember, we not only go northbound, we also go southbound for export to L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. So we expect to continue to add capacity in Mexico, because we feel it will be needed.","Michael Upchurch","Ken, a high level 10% of that capital is PTC and GAA, and the rest of the 90% is almost evenly split between maintenance and growth, if that helps you a little bit.","Jeff Kauffman","And you mentioned that you're not really investing a lot in Port Arthur right now, because that's kind of two years out. What are some of the major capital projects that you would kind of cluster in that or not spending on it yet, but it's a big part of three to five year growth outlook?","Michael Upchurch","Well, again, the biggest part of our investment for the Port Arthur Crude Terminal will be locomotives. And so we would all invest in locomotive as the growth materializes, so we just aren't going to be in a situation, where we're going to make a huge capital investment if the business doesn't grow.","We have already made some capital improvements around the Port Arthur area in terms of yard expansion sidings other things to handle the growth in capacity there. But those investments are also useful and necessary for our overall cross-border volume growth in intermodal automotive and grain, because that area is not only going to experience growth because of the energy markets, but that's a critical part of our network to and form Mexico. So again, if you just look at the discrete CapEx that is related to Port Arthur it's going to be primarily locomotives.","Operator","At this time, we've reached the end of our allotted time for questions. And there is time for one final question today, that question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Group.","Cleo Zagrean","My first one relates to automotive. I am trying to understand to what degree this retooling campaign is different from the historical pattern or different since the second quarter, such that now we are looking to a flat auto growth for next year, even off of what one could expect could have been easy comps this year?","Brian Hancock","This is a normal cycle for all automotive companies. When they have a heavy manufacturing environment, they'll need to go in and do a reset. They'll go in and do preparations for new models, new model years. And so this is a normal standard process that they go through.","When we think of, and I think Dave mentioned this, and I mentioned it in my comments, we see the automotive growth over the next two years being significant and that we'll be a large player in that. And so this is just a normal piece of the automotive world where they need to go in and retool the plant, revamp the plant and be ready to move forward with new models and additional volume.","So we feel very comfortable that the facilities will come down for a month or so, but that they'll be back online and we'll move forward with the automotive volumes and with the customers that we have, in conjunction with the new customers who will be starting and operating their plants in 2016 and 2017.","Michael Upchurch","Absolutely agree with what Brian just said. Just remember, those happen to be our two largest customers down there and represent almost half of the volumes. And so it's a little bit unfortunate. They are both retooling in the first half of 2016, but there is not much we can do about that, and make decisions to retool and change models. It doesn't change longer-term outlook for that franchise at all.","Cleo Zagrean","And then if we could focus on intermodal a little bit for next year. Can you share similar comments for that, especially since now we are in the process of, I would assume, re-signing business for next year and we're also looking for easy comps similar to automotive.","Brian Hancock","As I mentioned, we're not going to give you 2016 volumes. But we feel very comfortable that with the service improvements, with the new Wylie terminal and with the new APMT terminal coming onboard that we will continue to move a significant amount of intermodal volume. And we feel comfortable that that is going to continue to grow into the next few years and we're very upbeat on that.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Starling, I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","David Starling","I know the call has gone long. We've had a lot of questions. We appreciate everyone's interest. And we'll see you next quarter.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Go Royals.","David Starling","Go Royals.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"12347":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q4 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call January 23, 2015  8:45 AM ET","Executives","David Starling - President and CEO","Jeff Songer - Chief Transportation Officer","Pat Ottensmeye - EVP, Sales and Marketing","Mike Upchurch - Executive Vice President and CFO","Jose Zozaya - President and Executive Representative, KCSM","Analysts","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Allison Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Matt Troy - Nomura","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Justin Long - Stephens","John Larkin - Stifel","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","Operator","Greetings. Welcome to the Kansas City Southern Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David Starling","Thank you. Good morning. And welcome to the Kansas City Southern\u2019s fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Presenting here with me today will be Jeff Songer, our Chief Transportation Officer; Pat Ottensmeye, our EVP Sales and Marketing; Mike Upchurch, EVP and Chief Financial Officer; and joining by phone for the Q&A will be Jose Zozaya, our President and Executive Representative from KCSM.","Start with our fourth quarter review. For the fourth quarter, KCS revenues were up 4% on volume growth of 5% and a few items played into our revenue growth rate for the quarter.","First, as expected, we had very tough grain comps versus fourth quarter 2013. As you remember, it was during the fourth quarter of 2013, when we truly experience the surge in grain traffic, that surge provide a very tough comps for grain this past quarter.","But our grain business was strong in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s strong right now. There\u2019s still a lot of corn to be shipped before the next harvest. We still feel very good about our grain franchise.","After impacting fourth quarter revenues within the combined effects of lower fuel costs on our fuel charge revenues and the peso-dollar exchange rate. Together, these two items resulted in a 2% hit to revenues.","Despite the impact from low fuel costs and a weaker peso, revenues from our key strategic growth areas still increased a healthy 15% for the fourth quarter a year ago, as was the case throughout 2014.","Automotive led the way, we also experience progressively stronger revenues coming from L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas during the year and that business was especially good in the fourth quarter. Operational efficiencies, increased revenues and good cost controls helped us to achieve a 1.4 improvement in our operating ratio quarter-over-quarter.","Let\u2019s go to the full year for 2014, KCS met or exceeding its guidance targets. Our volume growth was 5%, matching our mid single-digit guidance. Revenue growth came in at 9% for the year, which matched our high single-digit projection.","We actually exceeded our operating ratio guidance, attaining a 1.7 point improvement and lastly, KCS 2014 adjusted diluted EPS growth of 21% was higher than our high-teens guidance. Mike Upchurch, will provide more detail on our EPS during his section of the presentation.","So on the next page what are we looking at going forward? First of all, we expect to have another very good year. While mindful of the very volatile energy sector, we still expect good core business growth in most of our commodities segments.","We are comfortable in projecting volumes growing in the mid single-digit range, led particularly by chemical and petroleum, energy, automotive and intermodal. We are also guiding to mid single-digit revenue growth.","Before anyone jumps to conclusion, the KCS growth is trending downward. Let me point out, that if you exclude the FX and lower fuel price headwinds, our 2015 revenue guidance is at or above last year\u2019s guidance. Taking another step further, lower revenues cause by lower fuel costs and foreign exchange are largely offset by lower operating costs.","Turning to our capital plans, we expect total CapEx to come in somewhere between $700 million to $720 million, compared to $703 million we spent in 2014. Jeff Songer, will go into little more detail about our plans. It\u2019s still a budget, but its built around planned, extensive business growth and ensuring we have the capacity to handle that growth.","I think we have a good track record in adding the necessary capacity in our system to maintain fluidity and give the double-digit long-term growth we see in some of our core strategic growth areas. We just cannot back-off capacity expansion at this point.","In addition to the 85 locomotives KCS required in 2014, the 2015 CapEx budget includes the purchase of another 50 new locomotives this year. We told you last year that was our intention. It is very likely that we will need every one of the locomotives this year but we will certainly need them by the early part of 2016.","I\u2019m comfortable with our capital budget. I think it will position us well with our cap and marketing growth as planned to enhance our franchise not only in 2015 but in \u201816, \u201817 and beyond. ","Now turning to the operating ratio. For years, analysts and investor have asked us to provide long-range operating ratio guidance. As you know, we probably stubbornly avoided doing so and we typically state that our annual 1 to 1.5 improvement projections. However, the proven ability of the KCS team to manage network cost and railroad operations coupled with business growth opportunities that extended well out in the future years. It has led us to rethink our position regarding our guidance.","Now more than ever we are comfortable more in guiding to KCS achieving a low 60s operating ratio by the end of 2017. Finally, let me make note of one area, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed, we\u2019re not providing guidance on EPS. Last year for the first time, we provided EPS guidance when we concluded that consensus EPS far exceeded our internal projections.","We render no obligations to provide that EPS guidance last year and in 2015, we\u2019re returning to our formal position of not providing EPS guidance regardless of whether our internal projections are above or below consensus EPS. We believe that we have continued to provide you with detailed information that allows you to make your own earnings assumptions and that\u2019s probably the way it should be.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff Songer for operations and capital plan update.","Jeff Songer","Thank you and good morning. Beginning with slide 9, productivity is measured by carloads per employee continues to improve as our operating team safely handled record fourth quarter volumes. [T&A] [ph] crews as well as maintenance of way in mechanical staffing levels are in good shape going into the year and we feel the hiring environment is stable. We will continue to focus our hiring efforts to align with our volume outlook and to keep pace with attrition.","Turning to slide 10. Operating metrics for the quarter are stabilizing and overall I\u2019m pleased with our performance relative to our increases in volume. For the quarter, velocity was up 7% versus the fourth quarter of 2013. However, in 2014, fourth quarter velocity was up 2% over Q3 and we should see this positive trend continue. It well remains below historical levels but its overall network health improves as terminal capacity projects come online in 2015. We should continue to see improvement in this metric.","Slide 11 illustrates our continued commitment to invest in the business. In 2015, growth-related investment continues to be the largest segment of our overall capital program. With respect to equipment, all 85 locomotives ordered in 2014 have been delivered and additional 50 locomotives have been ordered for 2015. And we will begin taking delivery of these units in February through mid-year. Additionally, we have secured options for 2016 and 2017 locomotive orders.","Capacity investment in our crude oil infrastructure includes both mainline and capacity improvements. Investment in our intermodal facilities continues with the opening of our new Wylie, Texas intermodal facility in mid 2015 and a continued expansion of our terminal in Jackson, Mississippi. Other significant projects such as the Sanchez Yard expansion and mainline siding additions will continue to support our network fluidity.","Lastly, investment in the mainline infrastructure is having a positive impact on operations. Aside from the crude, health, and safety of the overall network, track maintenance programs between Shreveport and Baton Rouge will allow for speed increases over some time -- some of the segment from 40 to 49 miles per hour.","Additionally, CTC implementation on the Laredo subdivision and in Mexico and continued mainline improvements between Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will allow for increased maximum allowing for speed in those segments. I want to thank the operating teams for their hard work and contribution to a successful 2015 ","I will now turn the presentation over to our Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Pat Ottensmeye.","Pat Ottensmeye","Thanks Jeff. Good morning everyone. I will begin my comments on slide 13. As Dave Starling mentioned earlier, fourth quarter revenues grew by 4% from last year to $615.6 million which is a new record for the fourth quarter. Carloads grew by 5% to 543.6 thousand. RPU declined slightly during the quarter as a function of foreign exchange in fuel as you can see on the box on the upper right hand side of the slide.","With the exception of ag and minerals and industrials and chemicals which I will speak to a little bit, it was really a pretty strong quarter across the rest of our entire portfolio and mix of business. For ag and minerals and particularly for grain, the fourth quarter of 2013 was an all-timer record for both volume and revenue because of the recovery from the drought of 2012.","As we have been telling you for the past year, fourth quarter comps in 2014 were going to be tough and that finally happened pretty much as we expected. I would say that our grain business is back to normal and we should see steady single-digit growth for 2015 and beyond subject of course to weather-related volatility.","For industrial and chemical business, revenues and volumes both increased by about 1% from last year. We saw strength in pulp and paper which was offset by weakness in metals and appliances. Metal shipments were negatively affected by lower demand for drilling pipe. Appliances were lower due to heavy shipments in the third quarter, driven by new Energy Star EPA requirements on refrigerators and freezers sold after September 15 of 2014.","Appliance shipments sequentially fell by about 46% from the third quarter of 2014. Metal shipments were negatively -- I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019ll make just another couple of additional comments on this slide. Intermodal volumes and revenues were affected by ongoing congestion issues. We talked about that in the third quarter throughout North America. It gets pretty well understood and we believe although we can\u2019t quantify very specifically that that affected availability of equipment for our Mexican business in particular.","Cross-border intermodal was up 9% during the quarter and as Dave mentioned L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas volumes and revenues increased nicely. Revenues were up 20% over the fourth quarter 2013. Automotive growth was particularly affected by foreign exchange and would have been about 20% revenue growth year excluding the impact of FX.","Just pressing quickly on slide 14, you can see our cross-border revenue did increase from last year by only 1%. The main factor there was grain. As Dave mentioned earlier, grain business and volumes in the fourth quarter of last year were very strong in 2013. So our cross-border grain year-over-year was down by about 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Just touched briefly on strategic growth areas, Dave mentioned growth rate of 15% and you can see here the splits by business commodity, all of them increased by rates that were faster and higher than our overall growth rate and again automotive which shows a bit of a decline here was all foreign exchange related, adjusting for foreign exchange, our automotive revenue would have grown by about 20%.","Moving on to slide 16, this chart is intended to illustrate the impact that foreign exchange and lower fuel surcharge revenue is expected to have on our full year revenue guidance that Dave gave you earlier. I would say the key points we are trying to make here is that our business is strong and as you will see on the following slide, that strength is really across all of our major business units.","In fact, adjusting for FX and fuel, we believe that we will be giving full year revenue guidance for 2015 that was about as strong as that, which we gave you a year ago, which you will remember was high single-digit revenue growth. Obviously, if we see any reversal of either fuel prices or peso values, we can see some strengthening to our guidance over the course of the year.","Moving to slide 17 to further illustrate this point about the FX headwinds. On slide 17, we show you our normal market outlook. We\u2019ve shown our full year linehaul revenue guidance slide to draw attention to the impact of the weaker peso on each of our major business units.","Linehaul revenue on this slide does not include fuel, so the potential impact of changing diesel prices could further change our outlook for 2015. The middle column here clearly shows that we believe core demand will be strong this year in a constant dollar peso environment, in which four of our six major business units will be expected to show double-digit linehaul revenue growth for the full year.","If the peso continues to deteriorate, going into the future of current future\u2019s curve, which is the assumption we are using in the column on the right-hand side of the slide, we will see additional headwinds primarily in our automotive and chemical businesses which have a higher concentration of peso-denominated customer contracts.","It may not be obvious by looking at the slide that the impact of foreign exchange is the drop as to mid single-digit revenue growth, so the couple of this business units are right on the edge of single and double, so you just have to trust this if the math does work out that way.","I will touch briefly on a few areas of interests and then leave the rest for Q&A. We are currently expecting our industrial and consumer business to be adversely impacted by slower shipments of drilling pipe due to the much publicized decline of new drilling activity, particularly in the Bakken and Eagle Ford regions.","For Ag & Minerals, the headline here is I said earlier is back to normal. Now that we are through the full cycle of draught and recovery, this business particularly grain is expected to be a slow and steady growth business over the longer term. Energy growth will come largely from higher Canadian crude oil shipments to terminals and facilities located on the KCS franchise in the Gulf Coast.","I will talk more about our outlook for crude oil in a few minutes. Our utility coal business is expected to be weaker this year than in 2014, due to lower natural gas prices affecting a couple of the power plants that we serve.","Automotive growth is expected to be strong this year, as we see the second ramp in production at the new plants that were opened in 2013 and 2014 in Mexico. As I mentioned earlier, foreign exchange could be a factor in this business over the course of the year.","Slide 18, we show some of the basic macro assumptions on which we are basing our guidance for 2015. The only one, I\u2019ll call out here is pricing and reiterate that we continue to see a strong pricing environment now and going forward. For the past few quarters, I have talked about the rates on the recent contract negations as an indicator of what the impact of pricing is expected to be going forward.","For the full year of 2014, we saw a weighted average rate increase of 4% on contracts that were renewed or extended. That compares to same-store sales, which is more of an indicator for the pricing environment in prior periods, which for the full year was closer to 3%.","Moving to slide 19, I\u2019ll spend a little more time here, as this is more of a qualitative view regarding our longer-term outlook. You\u2019ve all seen the negative side of the fall in oil prices in the form of reduced drilling activity, lower fuel shipments for pipe and recent layoffs that have been announced for some of the producers and service companies.","We\u2019ve seen some of that affect our business as well. However, we still believe that lower energy costs will be a net positive for the overall economy and the vast majority of our portfolio that is not directly related to the oil and gas production.","Remember that our crude oil business currently represents about 1% of our total revenues. And as I stated on this slide, the positive impact of lower energy costs is much harder to predict and forecast at this moment. So we feel that this will lead to some strengthening over the course of the year.","I want to talk a little bit more about crude oil since it has been sort of the dark cloud over the entire rail industry for the last few months. Two weeks ago, we hosted a series of customer meetings in the Port Arthur, Beaumont and Baton Rouge areas with several of our key customers, particularly those that are going to be the primary drivers of our growth in 2015.","These meetings included Canadian oil producers, U.S. refiners, terminals and transportation entities. Again, these were all of the key players on which we are building our estimates for growth in crude by rail this year. The key takeaway from our customer visit was that at\/or even below current price levels, producers and refiners still plan to move Canadian crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast.","You\u2019ve also seen that prices have fallen and spreads have narrowed, but because of the combination of factors including production commitments, infrastructure investments, hedge positions, our crude-by-rail business has gained strength from a year ago and we expect it to grow over the course of 2015 and beyond.","The infrastructure on the receiving end of our network continues to develop and by the end of 2015, the terminals that we serve will have added capacity in the form of track, steaming capabilities, unloading capacity to handle multiple trains per day. We do not expect that our business will grow to that level by the end of 2015, but we do expect substantial revenue and volume growth in crude-by-rail this year.","Remember that our crude business will be primarily driven by Canadian crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast, as we have not moved any significant volumes of Bakken crude oil for over a year now. We also met with Executive Team at Global Partners in two of the Port Arthur site of the crude oil terminal they are planning to build. Global is proceeding with permitting and remains committed and enthusiastic about the market opportunities in this region and for this project.","Moving on to our five strategic growth areas, you can see they continue their oversize growth rate collectively at 15% and each one grew at a higher rate than the overall revenue growth of the company as I mentioned earlier. We are very encouraged by General Motor\u2019s recent announcement regarding the $5 billion multi-year capital investment program in Mexico.","And see that as both validation of the continuing attractiveness of Mexico in the Mexico investment thesis, as well as conformation about our belief that we will see more auto plants being built in Mexico and we know that there are more OEMs looking for sites in Mexico right now.","Growth at L\u00e1zaro has returned to solid double digit range, and the interest in L\u00e1zaro is a protocol to serve markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast is gaining momentum. With the new APM Terminal well under construction, the long-term outlook for L\u00e1zaroC\u00e1rdenas continues to be very positive.","Finally, the much publicized growth of ethylene plants in KCS service region in the U.S. Gulf Coast is a reality that we believe will begin to generate revenue and volume growth for us in the next few years.","In closing, I would say that it doesn\u2019t necessarily feel good to us to tell you that our revenue growth is going to be in the mid single-digit range for 2015. So, hopefully, you will understand that statement is heavily influenced by factors that do not reflect the strength of our core business. We are still very positive about the outlook and absolutely no less bullish about the long-term growth prospects for KCS.","Business demand right now is strong. The economy appears to be gaining momentum. Our cross-border franchise is extremely well-positioned to benefit from growth in industrial activity in the U.S. Gulf Coast, south eastern markets in the U.S. and in Mexico.","If the peso were to recover the levels we have seen fairly recently or even stabilize at current levels, the revenue headwind caused by foreign exchange would reverse itself and we could get back to a stronger statement about topline growth that is more indicative of the strength of our business.","With that, I will turn the presentation over to Mike.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Pat. And good morning, everyone. I am going to start my comments on slide 22, our full year carloads increased 5%, while revenues increased -- I am sorry I am going to start on 21, fourth quarter carload volumes increased 5%, while revenues increased 4%. Lower fuel surcharge revenues and the deterioration of the Mexican peso negatively impacted our growth rate by 2 points. However, these negative impacts to revenue were offset by reductions in fuel expense and peso-denominated expenses.","Our operating ratio improved to 140 basis points to 66.7% in the fourth quarter, our best ever fourth quarter operating ratio and incremental margins were solid 66%. Reported EPS of $1.28, grew 24% from quarter a year ago and adjusted EPS of $1.27 was up 23% from the quarter a year ago. Reported to adjusted EPS reconciliation can be found in the appendix to the presentation that largely reflects the offsetting nature of our FX hedge loss and the FX benefits in our income tax line item.","Now moving to slide 22, full year 2014 carloads increased 5%, while revenues increased 9%. Lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative impacts, the deterioration of the Mexican peso had an approximate 90 basis point negative impact to revenues. However, again the negative impacts to revenue were offset by reductions in fuel expense and the favorable impact to peso-based expenses as a result of the currency deterioration.","Full year adjusted operating ratio improved to 170 basis points to 67.1% and excludes the impact of lease termination costs that are included in our reported operating ratio. Again incremental margins were a strong 52% for the year. Adjusted EPS increased 21% primarily from increases in operating income and to a lesser degree lower tax rate and lower interest expense. Now cover the drivers of both our fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS growth on the next slide.","Moving to slide 23, our fourth quarter adjusted EPS grew 23%, benefiting primarily from higher operating income and a much lower tax rate that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2013. I will cover the drivers behind lower tax rate on the next slide. And on a full year basis, most of the increase in our 21% adjusted EPS growth resulted from higher operating income. We also saw 4 percentage point increase in adjusted EPS from lower taxes, which I will cover on the next slide and a 1-point increase from lower interest expense.","On slide 24, let me cover a couple of things for you. On the waterfall chart, on the left hand of the slide we provided a reconciliation of our U.S. 35% statutory tax rate to both our adjusted and reported effective tax rates for the fourth quarter and full year. For the fourth quarter, our adjusted effective tax rate was 30.2%, as we saw benefits from income derived in Mexico, which is taxed at a 30% rate and adjustments representing a 4.5 point reduction to the tax rate that relate to short run in tax credits enacted by Washington late in the year, specifically in December, reversals of reserves for tax matters that were resolved in our favor during the course of an audit and other items.","Additionally the deterioration of the peso provided us the significant reduction of 13.5 points and reported effective tax rate. On a full year basis in the chart on the lower left hand side, our adjusted ETR was 32.6% as we benefited primarily from the lower tax rate in Mexico and to a lesser extent from the items I mentioned in the fourth quarter of 2014.","And on the right hand side of the slide, you can see the net impact of our hedge and the foreign currency impact on income taxes. In both the fourth quarter and the full year, the net impact is flat to $3 million positive respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hedge program in mitigating potential foreign currency impact. And to give you a little bit of guidance for 2015, we would expect our effective tax rate to be around 34.5%, an increase from our 32.6% for 2014.","Moving to operating expenses on slide 25, operating expenses increased 2%, but excluding FX impacts would have been up 4%. Key drivers of the expense increases included in the table on the right hand side of the chart and include volume related increases including headcount increases, namely in transportation and engineering, wage inflation and depreciation from our higher capital expenditures. Offsetting those increases were lower fuel prices and the net favorable impact of our lease conversion program, which reduced equipment costs.","Moving in to more specific details on expenses on slide 26, you can see our headcount increased 4% to 6,464 average employees during the quarter. These increases were due to headcount requirement in our operations, namely transportation and engineering. And Jeff gave you a perspective earlier on the need to stay ahead of our growth requirements, which is exactly what we intend to do. The incremental headcount caused the $5 million headwind to compensation expense, while wage inflation contributed another $4 million to higher compensation expense.","On slide 27, fuel expense declined $8 million or 8% largely due to decline in fuel prices in the U.S. but also slight benefit from the peso deterioration. Offsetting these declines were higher carload volumes that led to $2 million increase in fuel expense. Fuel prices in the U.S. declined year-over-year from $3.12 in the fourth quarter a year ago to $2.45 in the fourth quarter this year. However, fuel prices continue to increase in Mexico increasing from $3.04 in the fourth quarter a year ago to $3.20 in the fourth quarter this year. We do expect fuel prices to begin to stabilize in Mexico during the first quarter of this year, but increases in fuel cost in Mexico have created a different dynamic for us than some of the other Class I railroads during the fourth quarter.","Moving to slide 28 to give you a perspective of our fuel lag benefit, we saw a consolidated benefit in the quarter of $5 million, consisting of the $6 million benefit in the U.S. and $1 million headwind in Mexico. These two charts illustrate the differing the impacts we saw during the quarter.","On the left hand side of the chart, you can see in yellow the declines we are seeing in U.S. diesel prices, while the black line shows the impact to the customers that lag approximately 45 to 60 days depending on contracts and commodities.","However, Mexico on the right hand side, you can see fuel prices that shown in yellow continue to increase with the lag impacting slightly negative. Proportionately, we\u2019ll expect our fuel lag impact to be less than half of what the other class ones are reporting in the fourth quarter, given the rising prices of our KCSM fuel price.","On slide 29, you can see, we continue to reach substantial benefits in lower equipment costs. Equipment expense went down $9 million or 23%. Equipment expenses continue to decline as we rollout the full impact of purchasing and owning equipment that was previously under leased, along with the added benefit of being able to collect car hire when our equipment is offline, slightly offsetting the equipment declines or increases in depreciation charges from owning that equipment. Additionally, we saw $5 million increase in depreciation from a larger asset base due to our capital program.","And finally, on slide 30, we\u2019ve outlined our capital structure priorities, which are consistent with prior quarters and we continue to be focused on reinvesting our cash flows for business growth opportunity.","Our 2014 capital expenditures were $703 million or 27% of revenue. Jeff previously provided you with more details surrounding our capital spend and we do expect the similar dollar spend in 2015.","Well, CapEx is expected to decline slightly as a percent of revenue, maintenance CapEx. We do expect to continue to have increasing requirements around equipment capacity and PTC needs.","Moving to shareholders returns, our Board of Directors will continue to evaluate our dividend policy, which is to provide for a nominal dividend for our shareholders. For the fourth quarter, we paid out a dividend of $0.28 or almost $31 million.","Lastly, we continue to optimize our capital structure, like purchasing assets under lease. As of 12\/31\/2014, we owned approximately 51% of our equipment, which is up substantially from less than 20% we owned a few years ago. During the year, operating income benefited by $16 million as a result of those lower equipment costs.","Overall, we\u2019ve executed approximately $640 million of leased assets purchases and we do expect to continue to purchase more leased equipment in 2015 and continue to benefit operating income and net income.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave for some closing comments.","David Starling.","Okay. Thank you, Mike. We will now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. Good morning.","David Starling","Good morning, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","You gave some quite helpful perspective on the kind of the crude question. Pat, you gave us some good perspective on that. I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s -- and I apologize if I missed this, but what\u2019s the framework for how we would think about, in terms of maybe trains per week? What you might ramp up to towards the end of the year?","And I guess, also just considering, you said you guys use producers, refiners and pretty broad group together and got their input? What do you think the Canadian producers are assuming in terms of, if oil price to stay at the current level, is there going to be a big production cutback in 2016 or are they telling you, don\u2019t worry, production will still grow in 2016, because it seems like, I guess, that seems a point of uncertainty?","David Starling.","Yeah. Tom, it\u2019s -- we didn\u2019t pickup any real indications that producers were looking to cut production. In fact, we have one of our customers. I am not going to get specific in names. But one of the customers and really one of the biggest drivers for our growth in 2015 which is a producer and refiner and they\u2019re moving crude oil from Canada that they\u2019re producing and transporting at the terminal down to a facility in Louisiana to a refinery that they own.","So they more or less said, we\u2019re going to refine crude oil and we want Canadian and it doesn\u2019t matter to us whether the price is $70 or $50 or even lower. So we didn\u2019t pickup any specific commentary about cutbacks in production. The timing of the trip was, obviously, very convenient because we knew this call was coming up and we\u2019ve got to finalize our plan and forecast for 2015.","So we came away with a pretty good feeling that the numbers we have in our forecast are achievable, based on feedback from our customers that is about as recent as it could possibly be. I guess, on that we\u2019re basing all of our numbers on Canadian. Yeah, we don\u2019t have any Bakken. A little bit of wax maybe from Colorado but it\u2019s really, it\u2019s almost all Canadian.","As far as trains per week, we\u2019re not going to give specifics about guidance, because as you see, there\u2019s a lot of -- there has been a lot of volatility here. But the key point is that the facilities are built. We\u2019re moving crude oil there to a couple of them already.","One in Baton Rouge, we are finishing our connection too and we\u2019ll be able to deliver crude we think by the end of the first quarter and the capacity is there for multiple trains a day. How quickly it ramps up and how -- what the pattern looks like is an unknown and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to give guidance on that.","We may be able to provide a little more in the first quarter but right now, the connections are going to be build, that\u2019s important thing for us to give that portion of adorn. But the steaming capability, everything we saw is there and its ready and they don\u2019t need to build tanks because its going into a more surged tank and straight to the refineries, so that was most encouraging thing.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Yeah. I appreciate that. And I guess, I\u2019d be careful the way I work there. It\u2019s not the matter of production cost per se but a slower pace of production growth, perhaps is the way I was thinking about it. What about the terminal side of the one that feeds Baton Rouge. Are you optimistic about growth at other terminals like Beaumont or the Sunoco Logistics in Port Arthur, some of the others that are potentially growth drivers?","David Starling","Well, I think it\u2019s a same story. I mean, the Port Arthur market as we said for a long time, big market imports a lot of crude, 1.7 million to 2 million barrels a day, large concentration of heavy crude and the multiple refiners are looking to bring Canadian crude down.","Back when we were there, they were actually receiving, one terminal was receiving their first heavy train because they just had the steaming capability working and that was kind of actually testing it on its first heavy crude train, so it\u2019s just starting to gain the momentum.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. So you\u2019re optimistic on all of the terminals that you have talked about before. All right. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Allison Landry","Thanks good morning. So I can certainly appreciate you guys not wanting to provide EPS guidance. But given to your comments about revenues adjusting for the peso and fuel surcharges being at or above 2014, and considering that these items don\u2019t actually have a material impact on the bottom line? Is it fair to sort of assume or think about the earnings growth similar to what was seen in 2014 or even the mid teens growth that you initially guided to last January?","Mike Upchurch","Well, Allison, this is Mike. As Dave said, we are not going to give EPS guidance, but understand it\u2019s difficult to predict what\u2019s going to happen with fuel prices and what assumptions to use around for our currency. I mean I\u2019d be happy to give you the assumptions we\u2019ve used in our plans with respect to the peso at 14.11 average for the year, WTI around 54, Highway Diesel around 285, Gulf Coast prices at $1.74 and you guys can run some of your models there.","You are obviously going to get a little bit of artificial lift in your OR. I would point to extremely good incremental margins in the fourth quarter of 66%. And we are not going to give you a specific number there. But historically, we\u2019ve been around that 50%range. And I think it\u2019s likely we could be much better in 2015, given the dynamics as we see them right now.","Allison Landry","Okay. That was actually very helpful. Thinking about this is just my follow-up question. So think about Global Partners and Port Arthur crude terminal, correct me if I am wrong. But the plans to develop this I think were always for it to be a mixed-use facility. And based on some recent comments that you\u2019ve made regarding strengthening demands for exports of refined products in Mexico, is there any talk or possibility of a full forward in that construction of the facility?","Mike Upchurch","We are not planning on it, Allison. We are still looking at 2017 as kind of the best target date if we can get through some of the permitting issues quicker than this bigger known. They certainly will build it faster. But they are -- we are still -- the best guess at this point in still early 2017. And it is -- you are right, it is a multi product terminal that they have designed and envisioned so that will be refined products crude oil of the products.","Allison Landry","Okay. Excellent. Thank you for the time.","Mike Upchurch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","David Starling","Hey, Chris.","Operator","Chris, you are on mute.","Chris Wetherbee","Yeah. Sorry guys, thanks for taking the call. I was on mute there for a minute. When you think about sort of the energy outlook, particularly when it comes to Mexico? Can you give us just an update on sort of how we should be thinking about that. Obviously --prices you think that it would potentially be a little bit pushed out? But I guess, I just want to kind of understand it was ahead of schedule previously launched or get a sense of how you\u2019re thinking about that now?","Mike Upchurch","Really no change. Still not -- we don\u2019t have a lot to build in. We don\u2019t have anything built into our 2015 related Mexico energy. We could see some importation of refined products. We got a lot of interest. In fact, we posted a group of major potential partner and player in that market in Mexico this week.","So we are seeing a lot of interest. We still feel that the first wave of opportunity for us is going to be refined products going in. But we are looking at that as a 2016 and 2017 opportunity. And then all of the normal activity related to fracking and drilling will take place probably after that.","So I can\u2019t say, we are obviously, we are watching it closely. The impact of lower energy prices and crude oil, the peso, how that affects Mexico in general. One thing, we have seen and is this reflected in our numbers that you are seeing now and will be an item of discussion in the first quarter, is the strength in our business with PEMEX. So we got better growth opportunities with PEMEX now kind ahead of the impact of the changes, so that\u2019s a positive.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up. When you think about sort of the pricing dynamic in particular Mexico with foreign exchange fluctuation, we\u2019ve seen in the past some potential pressure there. I am just curious as to how to think about the pricing outlook in Mexico? This piece of your business that is priced in U.S. dollars and I just want to kind of understand how we should be thinking about that in \u201815, given where we are we are with the peso?","Mike Upchurch","Well, the impact will -- as you saw this quarter, as a significant portion of our revenues in Mexico are in dollars and for companies that are peso denominated that does cost them a little heartburn. We haven\u2019t seen any impacts yet on pricing. We\u2019ve had some discussions with primarily the ocean carriers, speaking of something like an adjustment factor, a currency adjustment factor. We haven\u2019t done that yet.","We did that a little bit in 2008 and 2009, for the purpose of protecting market share because we were hearing that there was some interest in moving to truck and we wanted to head that off. But so far, we haven\u2019t had a groundswell of interest in that. But getting to your core question, I guess we haven\u2019t seen any impact yet on pricing discussions in Mexico because of the peso.","Chris Wetherbee","And it\u2019s safe to assume sort of the core outlook for pricing remains as constructive as it\u2019s been?","Mike Upchurch","Yes.","Chris Wetherbee","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much for time, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Scott Group","Hey thanks. Good morning guys.","Mike Upchurch","Good morning.","Scott Group","So if I take a look at the long-term OR, it implies about like 200 basis points of improvement a year. Do you think that because of that dynamic with fuel and the peso that we should be thinking more than that 200 in the first year, and then what is the fuel and peso assumption for 2017 in that guidance?","David Starling","So, Scott, this is Dave. I\u2019ll take the first part of it. When we put the three-year guidance together, we certainly look at the fuel tailwind we have today. But we don\u2019t know how long that\u2019s going to last. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with fuel. And we don\u2019t have that same headwind or tailwind in Mexico. So we are only going to be benefiting from a half of our system on the fuel.","But our OR guidance is much more about the growth that we see and also the efficiencies that Jeff and Mike Naatz are continuing to seize out of the system. So that\u2019s why instead of saying 63, we said low 60s. So we are giving ourselves a range around 260. So we were compensating for that on the fuel, when we looked at the low 60s guidance.","Scott Group","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just next question. As we think about the implications of lower fuel and then also of our peso, do you think that the near sourcing to Mexico story at all gets impacted because fuel product costs were lower and the cost of shipping from Asia aren\u2019t as high? And then how does the lower peso may be help export for Mexico to U.S.? And just remind us how much of that cross-border is north-south versus the other way?","David Starling","How much is -- our cross border is northbound\u2026","Mike Upchurch","North-south, it\u2019s the other way, yeah.","David Starling","Yeah. Obviously, finished vehicles appliances, electronics, all of that, that\u2019s kind of the -- those are the industries that have sort of been the poster child for the near shoring phenomenon. Certainly don\u2019t see it slowing down, as I mentioned. We probably saw, if you haven\u2019t, General Motors made the press release in announcement of the $5 billion, a capital investment program in Mexico multi-year investment.","We talked a lot of about the auto plants appliances. We know that there are more auto manufacturers looking at sites in Mexico. So we don\u2019t think that\u2019s finished yet. So, I think the answer to your basic question is the peso and energy cost is all of that positive to the re-shoring and near shoring thesis and we think it is.","We\u2019ve always thought -- we talked a lot about the advantages of near-shoring and then particularly Mexico in terms of wages and currency and the transportation and labor. And one of the headwinds, if you want to use that phrase, kind of against that thesis is Mexico has -- historically has high energy cost.","So with oil coming down and with energy reform and all of the things that are going on, we expect energy cost in Mexico to become more attractive. And we think that we\u2019ll just add to the case. Our -- the North-South, it\u2019s our balance of northbound, southbound, our largest cross-border commodity is corn and that\u2019s southbound. Mexico imports a lot of corn and we move about 35% or 40% of all of the corn that Mexico imports and then it\u2019s autos, appliances, electronics and another products coming north. In total, it\u2019s actually fairly balanced.","Scott Group","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question.","Matt Troy","Yes. Thank you. Just wanted an update on your initiatives to increase length of haul, when you look at the cross-border business historically in some of the categories like automotive. You had to hand off a lot of that business and you talked either retaining on your own line partnerships, more of that business deeper into the U.S., if you could maybe just give us an update there and how some of your partnerships with some of the U.S. providers are evolving that would be helpful?","David Starling","Well, I will start off. We have a natural interchange with the union specific at Laredo. We actually cross more trains for the [indiscernible] than we do KCS trains. So together, those franchises are extremely powerful. And as we grow -- add more and more auto plans in Mexico, then that relationship I think will improve. But at the same time, UP knows that we are going to grow into those kind of service and we\u2019ve done that. So we\u2019re continuing to grow into some of the other lanes.","Particularly one of our targets is the Southeast. We think that\u2019s our sweet spot, our strong spot. So as these companies come online, that\u2019s a lot of the business we will be fighting for over the Kansas City gateway over that and over the Southeast. So again, I think you\u2019re finding the railroads today. We compete with each other, but we almost have to look at us as a network.","And a lot of times the best route for certain destinations will win, but we are winning our fair share of the finished autos. You remember five or six years ago we handled zero. So it\u2019s been a great growth story for us and we continue to build density. We have expanded out DDC in Houston to contain to handle more finished autos in the Houston for distribution in that market. So I think the story continues.","Mike Upchurch","Yeah. Matt, this is Mike. I\u2019d just tell you we don\u2019t report the length of haul, but I can tell you we are seeing nice increases in both length of haul in Mexico and in the U.S.","Matt Troy","I guess at the heart of that question was just the fact that you\u2019ve given us this longer-term OR guidance. I was just curious if that was predicated on material shift in your ability competitively to handle more of that, it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re making any huge assumptions there, kind of more of the same. Is that fair?","Mike Upchurch","Yeah. Continual growth, continual improvement on the cost side.","Matt Troy","Okay. Thank you. And my follow-up would be just the Port of L\u00e1zaro, obviously you\u2019ve got the West Coast favored issues. What\u2019s your sense? And I know it might be hard to just aggregate, but how much of the double-digit growth you\u2019re seeing more recently? Would you characterize potentially just to spill capacity coming from -- resulting from the labor issues up North, versus something that may be more sticky or contractual based where we can kind of bank on that more reliably in our models? Just trying to get a sense if you can see that yet and what that might be. Thanks","David Starling","Very little of it is related to the issues in LA Long Beach in the past. So almost say all of the growth that we\u2019re seeing in L\u00e1zaro is the function of Mexico shipments, and the amount it might be cross-border. We did do some test loads into the Houston market in the fourth quarter, but really no significant revenue contribution.","So most of the interest that I spoke about in cross-border is prospective and we think it will be sticky. We think it will be market that makes sense and we think it will be a business that we can retain on some sort of a contract basis. But I think too soon to get more specific and there are ongoing discussions, but we can\u2019t take any notices.","Matt Troy","Okay. Thanks for the time today.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Tom Kim","Good morning. Thanks for your time. Just with regard to the CapEx and the headcount, can you give us a sense of what percentage of both are coming, are for the U.S. versus Mexico?","Mike Upchurch","Tom, this is Mike. As you know, we\u2019ve always tried to keep consolidated reporting on any of those types of metrics, so we don\u2019t typically split that out. The only thing, I can say you on CapEx is we pretty much look at it as a network. So there is really not a dividing line of what we would do in Mexico or the U.S.","So if you\u2019re buying 85 locomotives and then another 50, those are for the network. So it would be one way to look at it. And if you went to our list of siding extensions and projects we have, I\u2019d say that they are pretty equal. There is really again one year we may build more sidings in Mexico than we do in the U.S. The next year we may build more in Mexico. So it\u2019s a one network look.","Tom Kim","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just with regard to the near sourcing opportunity, and obviously it\u2019s certainly a key feature of your business and then all is have clearly done well. I\u2019m just wondering if you are starting to see maybe a pickup in non-auto, non-auto-parts sort of industries for example and whether it\u2019s light goods or electronics and tech. Can you give us a sense on FDI and sort of growth opportunities outside of the auto industry?","Mike Upchurch","Certainly as all of the ones you mentioned, I mean Mexico right now I think is the largest manufacturer of household appliances. We\u2019ve seen all of the major appliance companies come there. And we are really seeing it kind of across the board. If you think about the factors that our attracting companies to Mexico, really applicable to almost any industrial product.","But the ones where we\u2019re seeing the best growth and the best example are clearly auto appliances, electronics. Starting to see some interest in other household items, like furniture which is still I think the largest import coming through LA Long Beach. But the thesis really would apply to most manufacturing.","Tom Kim","Okay. Thanks. Can I just ask one last question, just with regard to [St. Teresa] [ph], are you seeing any diversion of cargo, with the ramp in [St. Teresa] [ph]?","David Starling","Well, not it\u2019s related to that, but we have seen some diversion of shorter haul intermodal, I think, we have talked more about that last quarter, particularly to moderate Laredo has some diversion over Eagle path. I don\u2019t -- I can\u2019t speak to how high that is to [St. Teresa] [ph] specifically, but we have seen some diversion.","And quite frankly, some of that was intentional that, as you know, that the very short haul move for us, 150 mile and we were filling up our terminals in Mexico, particularly, filling Victoria outside of Monterey, spending a lot\u2019s of capital and really the economics of the short haul move just didn\u2019t support the capital investment.","Tom Kim","Make sense. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene","Yeah. Hi. Good morning.","David Starling","Hi, Bill.","Bill Greene","Mike, I kind of want to follow up a little bit on the cost side? I have the impression given the new OR longer term target and given the kind of the revenue outlook that, as the revenue growth ends up being perhaps a bit lower and I realize some of that currency related? But is the revenue growth kind of normalized as down overtime, perhaps there is an opportunity to focus a lot more on the cost? Is that sort of kind of what you\u2019re trying to convey here with some of this longer term OR, if revenue supplies to the upside I think you\u2019ve got to add a lot more cost, but maybe is not there you can tighten those screws a little bit, is that the way to think about that?","Mike Upchurch","Well, remember, Bill, the FX and fuel impact, I mean, I think, Pat, said it well are core fundamentals here are at or above what we delivered in 2014 and we look at our volume guidance of mid-single digits, you ought to be able to include it, at least what we had in \u201814 and could certainly be better.","But to address specifically your cost question. We do expect to continue to be able to re-benefits on our least equipment purchase strategy and we\u2019ve got a number of maintenance contracts that we\u2019re mining costs out of. We had some that concluded here at the end of \u201814 that we\u2019re able to successfully renegotiate and take costs out.","We\u2019ve had headcount a little bit higher in the last two quarters than what we\u2019ve typically seen, but there\u2019s a bit of a stair step there, so as you progress into 2015, maybe that levels off a little bit. So we still have cost opportunities here and don\u2019t forget the pricing environment being better than what we\u2019ve seen in 2014. So I think all of those contribute to pretty positive outlook we have going forward that helps us get down into low 60s.","David Starling","This is Dave. Some of the maintenance contracts we have, we actually will get more benefit in the out years than we do in near years. So we got some conversion costs to take over some of these facilities. So your best years, your greatest savings are going to be out in year three and four. So as far as we are concern, the cost reduction game never stops and we still got more opportunities, but it certainly not being driven by anticipated lower revenue.","Bill Greene","Okay. Fair enough. Pat, I just wanted to ask you one question on coal. The last time we saw that gas prices at these levels coal became -- even beyond Eastern Rails that started to become an issue for even some of the Western Rails and some of the plant to serve, I know, have sort of struggled economically from time to time can you put some parameters around what this natural gas price could mean for coal volumes or carloads?","Pat Ottensmeye","We think overall it\u2019s going to -- our utility coal business will decline kind of in a mid single-digit range for the year from last year.","Bill Greene","Given inventory, is that a back half issue more than a first half?","Pat Ottensmeye","No. I think it\u2019s going to start to show up in the -- even in the first quarter.","Bill Greene","Okay.","Pat Ottensmeye","Our inventory, we had a pretty strong fourth quarter in coal. I think our stock piles at the plants we serve are pretty healthy back to normal. So our coal comps have been positive so far. But I am expecting that to flip on us here pretty quickly.","Bill Greene","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Good morning. Can we just talk about the outlook on the 200 basis points of OR improvement, what -- is there, I just want to follow up on your question before that you had on. Is there a breakdown in there of what is fuel and what is peso in that? Just trying to understand what is the underlying improvement? And similarly when you talk about your Mexico fuel surcharge being behind the curve? Is there a move to get that ahead of the curve and make that a positive or can you adjust those surcharges quick enough?","David Starling","Well, the surcharges, Ken, in Mexico, really functions same way they do in the U.S. It just a government policy that causes our fuel costs to go up in Mexico and right now they are certainly faced with situation where fuel prices are significantly above world market. I don\u2019t know if any effort to begin the lowering fuel prices there and given that 30% of their government revenues are tied to oil. I wouldn\u2019t expect that. So, hopefully, we could see maybe a leveling out in Mexico.","As far as what the impact is going forward in \u201815, \u201816 or \u201817 on fuel or I wish I could predict the prices and if anybody saw this drop coming six months ago, nobody was talking about it.","And so we have tried to make some assumptions around futures curves that are available to everyone. I gave you a few of those numbers earlier on the call, but glad to follow-up afterwards and I give you those again. But, obviously, you get a little bit of a benefit in OR when you take that fuel out of the numerator and denominator. So there is a little bit left in OR, but that\u2019s not really core business strength, the\u2026","Ken Hoexter","No. I understand. I was just trying to \u2026","David Starling","Yeah. So drop in fuel was not the driver to go to the three-year guidance. The driver to go to the three-year guidance was more on how we look at our business and being comfortable with its consistent as we have been into 1 to 1.5 range would be other initiative that my math and Jeff have on the table that they are working on and the growth that we have on the automotive side and also on the Canadian crude, I mean, just, it came to the point of, why aren\u2019t we doing this. So we went ahead and laid it out there, knowing that fuel maybe back at its old level in 12 months or 18 months, we just don\u2019t know. But the guidance was not driven by a lower fuel prices.","Ken Hoexter","Wonderful. And Dave, can you talk about the status of the Mexican legislation, obviously, a lot of movement in this quarter and your thoughts and takeaways on the impact and what it might mean, whether its on the CapEx side, whether any other impacts to the business?","David Starling","We have talked about this in the past. We can\u2019t get into a lot of detail, because it has gone through the Senate, has gone through the Congress and it is on the President\u2019s desk. We expect that to be signed in the next two to three weeks, depending on the President schedule. They kind of do things when they want, but we do not think there is going to be any changes to it and is workable, and that\u2019s what we can kind of say at this point.","I certainly don\u2019t see any CapEx impact on that new bill. But again, we need to get it signed and then we will all know that it\u2019s done. But right now we are feeling very, very good about it. We worked very well with the government. I think the government understands today too how important the railroad is for the growth of the Mexican economy. I think the auto plans have been a real eye opener for them. They understand these auto plans wouldn\u2019t be locating in Mexico if they were not for the railroads and their efficiency.","Ken Hoexter","So is there anything -- I guess, I\u2019m sort of -- I know you don\u2019t want to comment too much but in terms of mandating access to your network or sharing infrastructure that was in the original legislation?","David Starling","I think we have stated in the past that those concerns have been taken care of.","Ken Hoexter","Okay. Appreciate. Thanks.","Operator","Next question is from the line of Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning.","David Starling","Hey, Justin.","Justin Long","Hey, wanted to follow up on the OR in the long-term target there. When you think about the progression to a low 60s OR. Is that primarily based on just the strong operating leverage in the business given a mid-single digit volume growth environment or could you kind of parse out how much of it is that versus cost and productivity initiatives that you are pointing?","David Starling","I don\u2019t know that we can break it down. I gave you the percentages but as we stated lower --rather than saying we\u2019re going to go to 63, we really felt like lower 60s given ourselves more room to go down was appropriate. Because if we -- this crude could surprise us, we hope it does. We are going to have the locomotives for it. We could certainly have a surprise to the upside. We\u2019ve already got the network in place to handle the crude. We\u2019ll have the locomotives.","So that could be a very pleasant surprise. It certainly would help drive the OR. We kind of push the fuel aside and said it, let\u2019s just -- the fuel is going to be whatever it\u2019s going to be. But some of these maintenance contracts that again the operating and as a team we\u2019ve been working on, really we are not going to start to get the benefit until this year.","But then the benefit grows and that will be better in \u201816, I believe it will be better in \u201817. So there is still long-term things we\u2019re doing that are going to continue to help us maintain those margins that we\u2019ve enjoyed. And the network has become more robust. I mean, we\u2019re able now to start to take some of the CapEx away from the infrastructure and spend it on more opportunities like lease conversions, improving the network from more volumes. So it\u2019s just a positive time for us.","We got to remember it wasn\u2019t that many years ago that we had a very, very high operating ratio. So this has been a very steady march for us down at this level. And we see ourselves now very, very good infrastructure. We are very pleased with our -- the development costs has gone down significantly every year. So it\u2019s time for us to join the pack and start getting a little more aggressive in giving you longer term OR guidance. And that\u2019s what we intended to do.","Mike Upchurch","Justin, this is Mike. Just to remember, in that low 60s, FX and fuel are generally pass-throughs and so this is all business related. The revenue pipeline is strong and as Dave said there is lots of cost opportunities there. So we feel very good about the business going forward.","Justin Long","Great. That\u2019s helpful guys. And my second question, I wanted to ask about headcount and apologize if I missed it. What are your expectations for headcount in 2015 and going forward as you progress that OR target? What are your expectations for headcount growth and you call it mid-single digit volume growth environment?","Jeff Songer","This is Jeff. I\u2019ll speak to that. So we\u2019re -- as Mike stated on the headcount, we\u2019re keeping pace with our volume. We\u2019re keeping on pace ahead of attrition. There are certain things we\u2019re doing on the mechanical side in sourcing some of that work which should be both operationally beneficial for us, financially beneficial for us in the long run. That may spike headcounts to slight above what we saw this year. But I would assume similar type growth year-over-year if not slightly elevated but for those reasons.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate your time today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","John Larkin","Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. The intermodal really started to grow very nicely in the fourth quarter, up almost 9% volume wise year-over-year. Are you getting to the volume now where you can begin to consider running a different schedule that would make your service more truck like and therefore accelerate the rate at which we\u2019re able to pull in highly conversions?","David Starling","John, this is Dave. We are there on few of the trains. We are actually pulling a little more up to Laredo and classifying some of those trains so that we can run them through. But we still got our ways to go on the critical mass of trying to run solid trains out of our big load centers. We have so many destinations in to the U.S. especially since MS has opened up more destinations for us on their network as they continue to open new ramps and add the Crescent and the Heartland. So a lot of it is just blocking and trying to get the critical mass. But the answer to your question is we\u2019re still moving forward with it. We\u2019re not quite there yet.","John Larkin","Thank you for that. And then maybe as a follow-on, with fuel prices really dropping fairly dramatically. Is there a point at which you would consider entering into any kind of hedge agreements to perhaps to put yourself on a stronger position once fuel prices revamp?","David Starling","I don\u2019t think so, John. I mean, we have the fuel surcharge mechanism in place and that really provides a natural hedge. So I don\u2019t believe that this point we\u2019re considering that. There are a lot of discussions we\u2019ve -- we recognized over and over time. But right now, we just think that we could get that much of a benefit.","John Larkin","Got it. Thanks very much for your time.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. Hey guys. Many of my questions have been answered. I want to focus with Mike on some of the free cash use and just some details here. You mentioned that little less capital to CapEx, little bit more to lease buyouts, can you talk a little bit about other uses of free cash because it will be growing over the next few years?","Mike Upchurch","Well, we annually have those discussions with our board. And we\u2019ll be having those discussions actually next week when we have had a little bit of history of increasing your dividend, not suggesting we\u2019re going to do that because that really is the board\u2019s decision. But we constantly take a look at that.","One thing, I would point out is that we\u2019re still not a cash tax payer in the U.S. and that will be at some point in time something that we\u2019ll have to use in free cash flow for. We don\u2019t anticipate that in 2015 because of the bonus depreciation that was enacted in December that retro-ed for full year 2014. We don\u2019t really expect that in \u201815.","But I think absent any additional bonus depreciation, we would expect in \u201816 or beyond to be cash tax payers in the U.S. and we are cash tax payers in Mexico. So that\u2019s the other element that you need to think about. And we go through that process every year with our board and look what the available cash opportunities are.","I wouldn\u2019t expect us to delever the balance sheet through paying loss debt. I think we\u2019re pretty comfortable with the leverage and talking to the agencies here in the next few weeks about where we\u2019re at with our metrics and hopefully seeing you here in 2015, is that we would continue to get an upgrade in our credit rating.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay, Mike. And just one follow-up detail. I didn\u2019t see in the release with the lease buyout cost for this quarter even though you did provide them on the year. Could you give the breakdown of the lease buyout costs in the quarter, as well as the amounts for the tax audit reversal and the short line credit for the tax rate?","Mike Upchurch","Well, the buyout was zero in the fourth quarter. We will have some in the first quarter. So we didn\u2019t execute any of those transactions and let me leave it at this. There are fairly small numbers in the fourth quarter relative to those reversals and tax credits, but they certainly helped in that 4.5% reduction I referred to in the chart. It was a good part of that number.","Jeff Kauffman","I see. So that $10 million between the two is the 4.5%.","Mike Upchurch","That would be a little high when you look at the 4.5% applied to pre-tax income.","Jeff Kauffman","All right. guys. Well, congratulations and thank you.","Mike Upchurch","Thank you.","David Starling","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.","Keith Schoonmaker","Yeah. Thanks. Could you pull a lot of attention unless you facts, I think will still more than double the revenue in volume and I understood one of the crude volumes has little blocking or U.S. facing exposure because frac seems one of the five strategic growth areas that you\u2019ve identified. I\u2019m interested if you\u2019ve seen shifts in shipment patterns away from the legacy Texas, Louisiana destinations and what you expect in sand shipments if gas and oil remain at current rates?","David Starling","We would expect it to fall but it hasn\u2019t. Our frac sand business so far in January was pretty strong and it was pretty strong in the fourth quarter. Our market in Texas or the Eagle Ford, we don\u2019t touch any frac sand, it goes north. And one thing that has happened is I think I mentioned this in one of the prior calls. We seem to have had a little bit of a disadvantage because some of the facilities that we serve aren\u2019t capable of taking unit trains and particularly when the service issues were the worst.","There was a noticeable shift to unit train loading and unloading and that hurt us at a couple of sites. We\u2019ve had some improvement in the infrastructure in our network and I think that\u2019s been one of the reasons that we\u2019ve seen a little bit of a surge here. But that business is decent and fairly strong right now. But if the gas prices or oil prices stay low or go lower, we would expect that to have an impact and probably see some weakness later on this year.","Keith Schoonmaker","Okay. Thanks. And as my second, wonder if you could just maybe qualitatively discuss how important driver shortage is to your intermodal franchise across the border and especially in the Mexican market given the dynamics we are seeing, maybe greater commission to some Mexican operators in the U.S.? Just in general, we hear a lot about the driver shortage in U.S. and I\u2019m interested in your color on driver shortage as a critical factor for your business in Mexico?","Jeff Songer","We think it\u2019s the real factor and it\u2019s going to drive larger, higher intermodal growth. It\u2019s a different situation in Mexico. But for the cross border product, which is our key focus and I guess I should also say and I think I highlighted just a little bit in the third quarter call. Our domestic intermodal business, which is primarily the Dallas, to and from the Southeast to mid-Atlantic has been growing very nicely.","And I think the driver issues that are very well publicized and understood is definitely a factor there, as it is on the cross border. So we see fuel prices are coming down, that takes a little bit of your advantage away. But all of the drivers for truck to rail conversion, I think are still very much intact and we see the intermodal thesis as a very strong growth area for us going forward.","David Starling","I think the other dynamic for the trucker too is all that\u2019s happening, the price of trucks are going up. The trucking companies are having to pay their drivers more to retain them. So it doesn\u2019t seem to have the effect that some thought it might on the conversion back to truck. So, I think rail is still going to continue to grow and all of the factors that are causing the truckers to convert to intermodal. There is just many, many of them from HOS to CSA regulations of the both dynamics to consider.","Keith Schoonmaker","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning and thank you. With fuel and foreign exchange having a lately benign impact on operating income and please correct me if my understanding is wrong? Can we please focus on the fundamental for the core business and specifically pricing? Is there any reason why you should lag, or maybe you could outperform the industry on this metric given your specific exposure to Mexico and your growth areas? Please help us understand how we should think about pricing going forward? Thank you.","Mike Upchurch","About the first question, our core business is, as I mentioned a couple of times in my comments, core business is strong. With the exception of maybe one or two areas, we have seen some weakness as I mentioned in the movement of steel pipe for drilling. We expect that to continue maybe for the first half. But obviously that will depend on the crude oil prices and the pace of drilling activity. But other than that, our core business is strong and I think we have kind of typically been a little bit on a high end, as the rest of the rails in terms of pricing outlook and some of that is related to Mexico and the inflation in Mexico.","But I still feel that we will be at the high end of the range regarding pricing. Mexico inflation is coming down but if you kind of look at the headline there, I think it\u2019s heavily influenced by things like tourism and things that don\u2019t necessarily relate to rail shipments and industrial products. But we think the pricing environment is going to continue to be good and probably better than the recent performance, better than last year.","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you very much. And my follow-up relates to your capital spending plan for the longer-term. Can you please refresh us on how we should think about spending and maybe how your plans relate to your strategic growth areas? What projects are you excited to come to plan to support growth? Thank you very much.","Mike Upchurch","Well, we are going to continue to spend about 9% to 10% of our revenue on infrastructure. We\u2019ll certainly have an IT spend every year. We will have PTC. But as you saw in the presentation by Jeff that portion of growth capital, be it for locomotives or siding extensions or for yards that will be based on our volume growth. So if you see an outsized growth in crude-by-rail down into the Gulf region, it might be a point where we would have to add more locomotives because of numbers of trains.","But, again, it\u2019s going to be driven by the revenue line. So it\u2019s hard to give you a number without understanding exactly what the growth of some of this commodity groups are going to bring, the automotive when those plans are build. We don\u2019t know exactly what those volumes are going to be and what our portion will be. So that is really going to be what drives the spend, so hard to give you a number or percentage.","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. On a fundamental basis, do you expect foreign exchange, or fuel to modify the opportunity available in automotive and cross boarder as the top areas in strategic growth?","Mike Upchurch","No. I mean, it will -- automotive, obviously, a lot of those contracts are peso denominated. So as you saw this quarter, it will have an impact on the results, the dollars, but we don\u2019t see it having an impact on the core business.","Cleo Zagrean","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Franz with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Tyler Franz","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David Starling","Hi.","Tyler Franz","Good morning. Hey, I\u2019ve got a question for maybe all of you. I\u2019m hoping you guys can kind of follow me here. But, I know, you\u2019ve got a lot of business in Mexico with U.S. companies? So we\u2019re in this very unique situation. We got Mexican diesel falling, U.S., I\u2019m sorry, Mexican diesel rising, U.S. is falling? So my question is how the surcharge mechanism works? So is it because the contract that housed is the U.S. is tie to U.S. and you maybe paying Mexican price? So you could be in situation where you get pinched or is that really not an issue?","David Starling","Well, it\u2019s really not an issue. I mean, we -- it\u2019s not a perfect correlation. It\u2019s a fairly complicated question to answer because you further add to that the way the interchange rules work in the U.S., if we take a load that\u2019s originated by another carrier, we can have a different fuel mechanism. It\u2019s not a perfect hedge, but it\u2019s pretty effective. And I guess, if your question is, does it driving behavior or is it driving decisions for people to think to use our network, we don\u2019t think it is.","Tyler Franz","Okay. No. That\u2019s a great color. And then, Dave, I got a question about the cadence of next year. So it seems to me you got, why we coming on in the spring, crude terminals come online, I guess, through the whole course of the year, APM terminal probably comes along in the back half, there are crude maybe in the back half and you probably have some building of auto volume? So is the idea that volume growth will probably improve as the year goes on and you have a really spring board in \u201816?","David Starling","We don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but that -- again we don\u2019t drive the crude. You\u2019ve got the origins and the destinations. Our customers are telling us, they are going to grow throughout the year, so certainly, that is one piece of it that we\u2019re encouraged by. The automotive, how quickly those plants get started and the issue we\u2019ve had with the automotive, Tyler is even though plant opens, there is testing to be done, there is quality issue, it doesn\u2019t just open and go to full capacity. So there is a bit of a startup.","You are right about APM. We\u2019re very encouraged by that. There are some discussions about possible diversions because of what\u2019s going on in the West Coast. So there are a lot of factors. Veracruz is one as well and even further development in L\u00e1zaro on the auto side. So there is a lot going on. It looks very, very encouraging to us. We do feel like on the locomotive side that we went ahead and bought a little bit into\u201916 this year.","And we went ahead and committed to \u201816 and \u201817 to make sure we have the slots, because locomotive production can be an issue. So that is our vision. We have not call that in our plan but that\u2019s our vision and we\u2019re hoping that\u2019s the way the story works out through the remainder of the year.","Tyler Franz","All right. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Starling, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","David Starling","Okay. Thank you very much for joining us. I know the call was going long. I know it\u2019s been a very interesting call with all of the FX and fuel revenue impacts that as we see offset by declines in expenses. We kind of look them as a pass through. So we had a very strong 2014. We met our guidance and we feel like 2015 is going to be similar year as full and we have a lot of opportunities on the cost control side. So the story is intact. We feel very good about it. We thank you for joining the call. See you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC.

All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, you may begin.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay, thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Kansas City Southern\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Slide 4 lists the presenters for today, and I think everyone is familiar with our teams, so I won\u2019t read their names.","I\u2019ll begin my comments on Slide 5. As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, our adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.12, a decrease of 9% from last year. Revenues were $599 million, unchanged from last year. Excluding the impact of further weakening of the Mexican peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 3% higher than last year. Volumes for the fourth quarter were also unchanged from 2015.","Our operating ratio for the quarter was 64.8%, which was 120 basis points higher than last year. There are some one-time items in the operating ratio for last year that made this a particularly tough comp for us, and Mike Upchurch will walk you through some of those factors in a few minutes.","Our operating ratio for the full-year was 64.9%, which was a 190 basis points lower than last year. We\u2019ll talk in bits and pieces about the 2017 outlook, but obviously, the political and economic uncertainty is probably first and foremost on most of our minds. And the irony of us reporting earnings on the inauguration day of the 45th president is not entirely lost on us, so we\u2019ll move on. But and I just want to pick up the last point here. We still remain very positive longer-term about the growth opportunities that we\u2019re facing. Brian Hancock will talk about many of those growth opportunities in a little while.","Moving onto Slide 6, I wanted to provide a few \u2013 some commentary on a few of the more interesting topics that you\u2019ll hear about in the presentation that follows, and that we know what is on all of your minds. And first, there is the U.S.\/Mexico trade issue. Obviously, there are still many questions about the future of NAFTA and the trade relationship between the U.S. and Mexico.","While we\u2019ve gotten some indication of the direction of the new administration through the nomination of most of the key trade policy makers, we still don\u2019t have definitive answers to several of those questions. What we do know is that the president\u2019s team has indicated that there will be a process for reshaping America\u2019s trade policies, which could include updating NAFTA. The Mexican government has expressed its willingness to begin the process of modernizing the agreement as well.","I\u2019m extremely pleased to have been recently chosen by the U.S.\/Mexico CEO Dialogue to lead its Strategic Trade Working Group. The U.S.\/Mexico CEO Dialogue is an organization through which business leaders on both sides of the border seek to enhance trade and economic collaboration between the U.S. and Mexico, as a private sector complement to the government to government high level economic dialogue, which involves the Presidents and senior officials from both countries.","Second, the Mexican peso continues to weaken against the U.S. dollar and now stands at levels that are almost 20% below last year. In prior quarters, we\u2019ve talked about the impact the weak peso could have on our business, particularly in our international intermodal business.","I\u2019m happy to report that it looks as if we recovered some market share last earlier in the year in our business at C\u00e1rdenas. Furthermore, it does not appear that the currency value is having a negative impact on our overall portfolio pricing. Brian will discuss both of those topics in a few minutes.","Most of you\u2019ve noticed that Mexican increased fuel prices on January 1, in some zones by as much as 15% to 20%. Our average diesel fuel cost in Mexico now stands about 70% higher than in the U.S. The excise tax credit helps to offset the higher Mexican fuel cost, so we will need to aggressively manage our fuel procurement and locomotive management strategies to make certain we don\u2019t experience any margin erosion, as Mexico continues to work through its energy deregulation timelines.","On the positive side of that equation, the level of interest we\u2019re seeing from U.S. refiners exporting fuel into Mexico continues to gain momentum, and we expect that to drive higher shipments of refined products beginning in 2017. Again, Brian will have more to say on that topic a little later.","Finally, our operating performance during the quarter was admittedly not up to our expectations, and we saw a noticeable deterioration in terminal Dwell during the quarter. Drilling into this a little deeper, this is not an altogether negative story. One of the primary contributing factors to our Dwell performance was the opening of two new and very large customer facilities in our Northern region, which encompasses the Monterrey-Nuevo Laredo area. Both of these facilities were not fully prepared with adequate track infrastructure inside their facilities when they opened.","This resulted in severe congestion in three of our terminals in that region, where we saw a 19% increase in volumes over the last year. The good news is that the needed track infrastructure is being built now, and we can see a clear path to improvement in the near-term. Jose Zozaya will get into that in more detail in a few minutes.","Moving onto Slide 7, just one more comment or a couple more comments about trade in Mexico. This slide shows all of our cross-border traffic, including the business that we interchange with Union Pacific at Laredo by export and import. As you can see, 60% of our total cross-border carloads are southbound or export business. Most of you know that KCS\u2019s largest cross-border commodity group is grain, specifically, yellow corn from the Midwest into Mexico.","Furthermore, two of our large cross-border business opportunities for the future are also export-oriented from the U.S. to Mexico, namely refined products in plastics. There\u2019s enormous amount of data available about NAFTA and I don\u2019t intend to go through any of that today. However, I wanted to show this chart simply to convey that this is a complex issue, and there\u2019s a lot of risk for both the U.S. and Mexican economies. If any future trade negotiations are not handled very thoughtfully, which I\u2019m sure they will be.","I believe that any modification in NAFTA can and will be done in a rational way that will likely strengthen North America\u2019s economy and KCS future. Mexico is our neighbor and our third largest trading partner. Our economies in our societies are inextricably connected.","I\u2019m encouraged by some of the Cabinet nominations and comments that have been made since the election and in my role with the U.S.\/Mexico CEO Dialogue, I\u2019m hopeful that I will have an opportunity to engage directly in the process, not only mindful of KCS interest in this topic, but that of most of our large customers as well.","With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer.","Jeff Songer","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. Beginning with Slide 9, velocity for the quarter of 28 miles per hour improved 3.6% over the prior year and 1% sequentially. While Dwell for the quarter of 24.6 hours increased 16% versus prior year and 2% sequentially. Dwell performance primarily in the border terminals at Monterrey, Sanchez and Nuevo Laredo fell short of expectation, as congestion in volume in this region created inefficiencies in our operation.","While total Mexico volumes were up 4.3%, regional volume into the Monterrey metropolitan area grew by 19%, facilitated by growth in our total Mexico agriculture segment of 27%, automotive growth of 14%, and metals and other carloads up 13%. Overall system Dwell, excluding the three terminals was 22.4 hours.","Expanding upon the system to Dwell performance in the North region, substantial growth with our largest soybean customer in the Monterrey area ahead of the planned track capacity improvements at the facility required us to hold these cars in our facilities for an extended periods of time.","The cross-border grain traffic is also subject to additional customs inspection processes inside of our Sanchez facility, which is another factor of increased Dwell at this terminal. This customer is in process of expanding their tracks to provide multiple unit train capacity at their facility. We anticipate, this work will be complete in early Q2 and allow us to spot these trains directly into the facility without additional handling and Dwell in our terminal.","Also note the new KIA business that started in mid-2016 has been handled inside of our main switching terminal in Monterrey, as we await the completion of the track construction at the KIA facility. We anticipate to move this work out of our terminal into the KIA facility in early Q2, which should provide some congestion relief to this terminal. Also of importance is the completion of additional classification tracks at our Sanchez terminal.","While we incurred a few weeks of weather delay at the end of the year, these tracks will be complete in February. This project allows us to move some switching operations out of our congested Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo yards and will provide ongoing benefit to the region. We continue to work actively with other customers in the region to analyze our transportation service plan and identify additional opportunities to planning and capacity enhancements that will continue to support the growth in the region.","Turning to Slide 10, we remain very positive on our overall operating outlook. We recently announced the addition of Mr. Kurt Jacobs as Vice President of Transportation in Mexico. Mr. Jacobs joins us from Brink\u2019s Mexico, where he served as Chief Operating Officer. Kurt brings with them 25 years of operating and logistics experience and will focus on the day to day execution of operations and continuous improvement in our key performance areas.","Entering 2017, our resources are well aligned. 5% of the U.S. workforce is in furlough status and 8% of locomotives are in storage. So we are prepared to handle additional volume as required. Another positive from 2016 that we will continue to build on is labor management and productivity. Excluding personnel associated with the car repair in-sourcing initiative, overall headcount was down 1% for the quarter. Significant full-year reductions in recrews and a $6 million reduction in overtime illustrate our operating team\u2019s focus on cost and productivity controls.","In Mexico, recent productivity improvements can be seen, as total volume increase 4.3% for the quarter, while T&E headcount remained essentially flat. Additional opportunities for expense reduction include our mechanical restructuring efforts. In 2016, we were able to restructure our car and locomotive maintenance activities, which will provide an ongoing annual reduction of about $10 million.","Turning to Slide 11, 2017 capital spending will reduce by approximately $30 million from $584 million in 2016 to a range of $550 million, $560 million in 2017. General and maintenance spend will reduce in 2017, given the improvements in infrastructure we have made over the past several years, including the completion of the Monterrey to Nuevo Laredo track upgrade, which was completed in 2016.","In addition, we do not currently have plans to purchase locomotives in 2017. While overall CapEx will reduce, we remain committed to capacity enhancements across the network, led by our continued investment in Sanchez yard and additional mainline siding capacity projects. Our Sanchez yard expansion will continue to allow for additional capacity and improve mechanical facilities in 2017. Continued investment in Sanchez supports those terminals, such as Monterrey and cross-border traffic that are experienced the largest growth in our network. Work at the Sasol support yard facility continues and is on schedule for our late 2017 completion. PTC is another area of significant investment in 2017, but we look for this to reduce substantially starting in 2018.","I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock.","Brian Hancock","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start my comments on Page 13, where you can see that both volumes and revenues were essentially flat in the fourth quarter compared with last year.","Revenue in Q4 was impacted negatively by foreign exchange, which was offset by FX adjusted revenue growth of 14% in our Ag and Mineral business, 9% FX adjusted revenue growth in our Industrial Consumer segment, and 10% adjusted revenue increase in automotive. If you eliminate the impact of foreign exchange, our fourth quarter revenue would have been up 3%. Volume was also flat at 550,000 carloads for the quarter with 6% growth in our industrial consumer carloads, 10% carload increase in our Ag and Min business, and a 19% increase in automotive.","The revenue per unit was slightly up for the quarter with gains in pricing and mix being offset by the impacts of foreign exchange and fuel. Core pricing for the quarter was approximately 3% based on same-store sales and renewals, and we expect 2017 to be at or above the levels we experienced in Q4.","On Page 14, you see a total year analysis by line of business that provide some context for this year\u2019s results. For the full-year 2016, our Ag and Min business unit saw growth of 7% in revenue and 5% in carloads, led by our grain and food business, which offset lower volume in the minerals group. The slowing in minerals was the result of several large construction projects being delayed or canceled due to the flooding in the southeast earlier in the year.","Our Automotive business had a solid year considering the number of plant shutdowns we experienced. Total automotive carloads were up 5%, which is very, very encouraging when considering automotive volumes were down 12% at the end of Q1. Automotive revenues adjusted for foreign exchange were down 2% for the year. Besides currency, lower year-over-year revenue was due to a mix change, as well as some of the longer haul plants being down earlier in the year.","At the end of the year, all of the KCS service plants were running at planned volumes and the new facility that opened in 2016 were all producing and shipping vehicles at the expected rate. Also, given the continued strength in the number of vehicles coming in at the L\u00e1zaro port, 2017 should be a very good year for our automotive business.","Our Chemicals & Petroleum business unit had flat volumes year-over-year with adjusted revenue up 2%. Industrial and consumer volumes were down 1%, with adjusted revenue up 1%. Overall very solid results, given the tepid business environment in some of the base commodity segments.","Our business with Pemex this year experienced some volatility as refinery and storage capacity fluctuated throughout the year. An early announcement of refined product importation opportunities combined with significant outages at many of the KCS serve refineries created an environment, where volumes were very difficult to predict. This was all in conjunction with the Mexico energy reform to begin rolling out across the country in 2016. I\u2019ll discuss this in a \u2013 in more detail in a moment.","Our intermodal business continued to see significant competition from inexpensive trucking and industry consolidation among major ocean shipping lines. It was also affected in the first-half of the year by flooding in the southeast and civil protest in Southern Mexico that impacted service. Our cross border business with UP continues strong and with the completion of the new APMT terminal in L\u00e1zaro and the new service with BNSF, we\u2019re optimistic that our intermodal business will be positively impacted in 2017.","For the total year, our energy business was down approximately 10% in carloads and 20% in revenue. This segment continue to be negatively impacted by lower coal and crude volumes, driven primarily by smaller spreads and the low price of natural gas. As you know, frac sand volumes have also been impacted by the significant changes in the energy markets.","We continue to look for creative solutions in this important segment, but volumes will largely depend on the prices of natural gas and the prices and spreads associated with crude. We\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in January, which makes us cautiously optimistic that our energy business can improve as we move into 2017.","On Slide 15, we provided year-over-year summary outlook for each industry segment. As you can see, we have a favorable or unchanged volume projection for every business unit. This includes the growth in both new and existing intermodal products, as well as the impact of the new container terminal at L\u00e1zaro. It also includes growth in the plastics business, as new plastics facility start to come online in late 2017. It also includes a full-year of volume from the automotive facilities we serve. We believe our Ag and Min business will grow at a more moderate rate than it did in 2016, but we still expect it to be a good year.","We also expect steady volumes in paper and steel with upside in appliances, as home construction and home improvement activity escalates. We should also see stability in coal, crude, and frac sand, although we do not believe they will return to the levels experienced in 2015.","On Slide 16, we wanted to provide an update on the Mexico energy reform and how KCS is supporting this critical initiative. Earlier this month, the government of Mexico announced that the plant transition to global market pricing for refined products, including unleaded fuel, premium fuel, diesel, and LPGs would move forward in 2017. The government also announced that the reforms will be rolled out by zones. These zones are listed on the slide, along with their expected changeover dates.","As most of you know, KCS announced last week a major investment in the new fluids terminal in San Luis Potosi. We have joined Watco and WTC in the development of a facility, which will serve all of Central Mexico as a public fluids terminal. Obviously, there will be some volatility by zone as the new global pricing reforms are rolled out and there have already been protests in some regions, where prices have increased to reflect the non-subsidized cost of providing fuel to a given region. KCS has already moved its first unit train down to the Howard PMI terminal in San Jose Iturbide this month.","Slide 17, highlights some of the details of the new SLP facility. Construction on the terminal is already begun, and we expect to complete Phase I in the second quarter of 2017. Phase I will allow terminal operations to unload product from railcars directly into trucks, which will allow us to serve the needs of the region as quickly as possible. Phase II of the project will include the construction of storage tanks on the property and will include both public and private storage capability.","On Slide 18, we provide a snapshot of the other projects that already exist or being built on KCS. Many of these terminals have both storage and transload capabilities to serve their particular geographies. As you can see, seven of the facilities are already in operation and seven are under construction. It is expected that KCS will take a leadership role in helping Mexico move toward a market-driven energy model, which will ultimately help the country meet its increasing energy needs.","Our investments in capacity and fluidity, as well as our newly announced investments in strategically located stores terminals will allow KCS to develop an efficient infrastructure to safely bring refined products into Mexico from the U.S. and ensure security and capacity for our customers. Overall, there\u2019s much to do over the next 12 to 24 months. There will be normal temporary setbacks at times, but we\u2019re totally engaged in and committed to the opportunities in front of us.","As Jeff mentioned, we\u2019re making strategic investments, which will help support our customerss growth strategy and we\u2019ll see the benefits of these investments in the form of enhanced system capacity, better operational efficiency in fluidity, and ultimately increased bottom line profitability.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to start my comments on Slide 20. Fourth quarter volumes and revenues were essentially flat ending a string of seven successive quarter\u2019s of revenue declines. Our revenue performance was impacted by the significant deterioration in the peso, which negatively impacted revenues by $17 million.","For those of you who are trying to reconcile our reported volumes to the AAR volumes, we have included a reconciliation in the appendix on Slide 42, but the difference essentially relates to the AAR not using a calendar quarter. Operating ratio was 64.8% in the fourth quarter, higher than the 63.4% operating ratio in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Now cover expense details in a few pages. Reported EPS was a $1.21 per share, down 5% from the fourth quarter, while adjusted EPS was $1.12, down 9% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Negatively impacting EPS was the higher OR, slightly increased interest expense and an increase in our income tax provision, primarily the result of a fourth quarter tax adjustment that increased our adjusted effective tax rate to 37.6%.","I\u2019ll cover those details in a few minutes. Offsetting those negative items was a pick-up as a result of the repurchasing of our stock and you can see further details on Slide 34 that reconciles EPS in the appendix.","Moving to Slide 21, annual carloads and revenues declined 2% and 3%, respectively. Reported operating ratio improved to 190 basis points, while adjusted operating ratio improved to 150 basis points. Large expense decreases for 2016 included a $63 million fuel excise tax credit, foreign exchange benefits of $63 million, fuel price reductions of $22 million, and lower headcount and labor productivity of $15 million. The increases in expenses will largely attributable to incentive compensation, wage increases, and depreciation.","Reported EPS increased 1%, while adjusted EPS was essentially flat. Year-over-year, changes include improvements in operating income and a lower share count, offset with higher interest expense and a slight increase in the adjusted effective tax rate and further details are in the appendix on Page 34.","Moving to Slide 22, let me briefly cover our effective tax rate. As you see in the waterfall charts on the left, our FX adjusted effective tax rate was 37.6% in the fourth quarter and 34.4% for the full-year. We also have provided the reconciliation from ETR to reported ETR with the difference being the income tax benefit we received from a deteriorating peso as the currency continued to devalue throughout 2016.","During the fourth quarter, you can see an increase of 4 percentage points within other in our ETR, primarily the result of a one-time non-cash tax reserve we booked as a result of an uncertain tax position that developed late in the year relating to some prior year tax returns. While we believe we have good facts and circumstances that should make a compelling argument for our position under GAAP, we\u2019re obligated to record a $5.8 million tax liability in the fourth quarter.","While it is difficult to predict the final outcome of the matter, we do not believe it will have any material negative future impact to our taxes or earnings per share. The table in the right side of the slide shows the income tax benefit of the deterioration in the peso offset by our hedge loss. Our hedging strategy, which we employed four years ago continues to be an effective strategy to mitigate any substantial EPS impact in our P&L due to foreign currency.","Moving to Slide 23, expenses increased 2%. We experienced a $16 million decline due to foreign exchange, while the Mexican fuel tax credit contributed $13 million to lowering our net fuel costs.","Offsetting those reductions were increases in incentive comp, $5 million in increased equipment costs, which is a combination of the mix shift to more automotive and grain carloads that increased 19% and 10%, respectively, in the fourth quarter, $1 million in early termination and lease termination charges, and $1 million from higher cycle times in Mexico. We also experienced $5 million in fuel cost increases and $4 million in depreciation.","During the quarter, we also had an approximately $5 million net negative comparison to last year related to some labor and benefit claim true-ups, a legal settlement, and a personal injury actuarial true-up that benefited 4Q 2015.","I wanted to make a few comments with respect to the maintenance expense savings, which Jeff indicated, was approximately $10 million annually. To help account for the changing geography of these expenses, during the fourth quarter, we saw a reduction in purchase services of $8 million, which represents vendor savings from in-sourcing a contract, offset by a $1 million increase in compensation expense as a result of hiring the vendors and employees, along with a $5 million increase in materials and other to purchase parts for our facility.","Turning to Slide 24, compensation and benefits were up $11 million, primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense of $7 million, which represents an increase payout assumption for 2016 versus 2015, and a $3 million year-over-year increase in our long-term incentive expense mainly as a result of a $3 million credit booked in 4Q 2015 to reduce the payout levels.","Foreign exchange benefited comp expense by $5 million. And while we experienced wage inflation of $4 million, we largely offset that with a $3 million improvement from lower U.S. headcount and U.S. productivity improvements. In the bar chart, excluding the mechanical in-sourcing, headcount actually went down 1.4% year-over-year. The addition of 260 mechanical FTE is lower than what our vendor was employing another indication that in-sourcing this work makes economic sense for KCS.","Moving to Slide 25, our fuel expense declined $2 million, foreign exchange benefited fuel by $7 million, offset by $3 million of increases in combined fuel prices in both the U.S. and Mexico. Consumption, as measured by increased GTMs added $2 million in fuel expense, and on a year-over-year basis, our negative lag was $3.3 million.","Let me provide you with a little more information on fuel expense and what we anticipate for 2017. As we expected, the Mexican government has extended the fuel tax credit for 2017, and we currently expect to receive a credit of approximately $60 million similar to 2016 levels.","As Brian mentioned a few minutes ago, the Mexican government is beginning a transition to market price fuel that will be implemented throughout 2017 on a zone by zone basis to achieve true market pricing by 2018. Effective in January 2017, fuel prices did increase in the range of 15% to 20%. While we expect to have some negative lag impact during the first quarter, some of the higher fuel prices can be mitigated by KCS, so we pass those costs on through our existing fuel surcharge programs and by purchasing fuel in the most cost-efficient manner taking an advantage of inter-region pricing in Mexico, cost effective cross-border purchases of fuel, and our position as a transporter of fuel for our customers, whereby we may be able to purchase fuel directly from them on cross-border refined product trains we\u2019re moving into Mexico.","And finally, on Slide 26, we\u2019ve outlined our capital structure priorities. Again, first and foremost, we will continue to invest in capacity needs to support our growth opportunities. Despite the downturn in the industrial economy over the past two years, we are still moving 15% more freight than in 2007, while the rest of the class one rails combined are moving a 11% less freight. And this has required us to continue to invest in capacity projects and rolling stock.","In 2016, we generated $169 million in free cash flow, the highest annual level of free cash flow generation by KCS, along with a strong balance sheet positions us well to continue to find ways to grow our business, while also providing shareholders a return. 2016 capital expenditures were $584 million within our prior guidance, and for 2017, we do expect a slight decline in capital to the $550 million to $560 million range, despite continuing to incur peak spend levels for the Sasol Lake Charles development and PTC, which combined will be about $115 million next year.","We continue to execute the share repurchase program during the fourth quarter, and on a cumulative basis, we have now repurchased 4.3 million shares for approximately $380 million. We continue to expect to conclude that program by June 30 this year. We continue to make further progress in our lease conversion program and now own 67% of our locomotives and freight cars, up from 18% in 2011. We continue to evaluate new purchases of leased equipment and we\u2019ll take advantage of those opportunities when it makes economic sense to do so.","Finally, we retired our $250 million floating rate notes in October, with proceeds we obtained from our May debt issue, which was a ten-year note at 3.18%. We do not have any significant maturities until 2020, giving us ample financial flexibility.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay, thanks. I just have a couple of comments before we open it up here. I just want to go back. First of all, I misspoke in my opening comments about the operating ratio change for the quarter. I stated, it was 120 basis points, obviously, when you saw Mike\u2019s slide, it\u2019s a 140 basis points. But just kind of putting a little bit of a wrap on the quarter and the outlook, I think, again, while it\u2019s hard to get it too excited about revenues being flat.","As Mike mentioned, this ended a string of seven successive quarters of revenues \u2013 revenue declines. The outlook obviously, Brian, went through by commodity on Slide 15, we think it looks pretty strong and we\u2019re enthusiastic about 2017. And as Jeff mentioned in his comments on the performance, the operating performance when you consider that some of the deterioration that we saw was related to a surge in growth, particularly in the Northern part of our network. And the capital investment that\u2019s being made to deal with that, we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019ll see a return to more solid performance numbers very soon.","So with that, I will open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Konigsberg","Yes, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just I\u2019d like to start off just on the pricing dynamics. So fairly strong in Q4, you\u2019re expecting that or better in 2017. Maybe can you talk about your expectation for the cadence of price, and how does that compare for your expectations on inflation?","Brian Hancock","Brian, this is Brian, thanks for the question. Obviously, we feel very good in the quarter about the way that pricing came in from a core perspective. When you look out as we look at the business that we\u2019re repricing here in the first and second quarters, we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re going to continue that that pace.","When you think about above inflation, that\u2019s really the way we\u2019re looking at it. Obviously, there are a number of uncertainties that we have to take into account with fuel, with FX, and some other things, and so we feel very comfortable with that. We continue to see pressure on our intermodal business and you have to compete in the markets that you\u2019re in. And so there\u2019s a lot of interesting things going on from a trucking perspective, both in Mexico and the U.S. And obviously, the ocean carriers continue to make changes as that that industry consolidates.","And so we feel comfortable that we\u2019re going to be able to maintain and potentially improve on what we\u2019re doing in a number of our segments. But again, if you look on Page 15, you can see kind of the segments that we really see positives in, and we\u2019ll continue to work towards those early in the year.","Brian Konigsberg","Great. And just secondly, maybe if you could comment a bit just on the customer base, obviously, we\u2019ve heard a couple of the auto OEMs talk about moving production, or redirecting their capital out of Mexico back to the U.S. Just curious with your conversations with other customers, and I\u2019m sure these things are fluid and you probably are hesitant to give specifics. But are you coming across other customers that are sharing incremental concerns, and maybe if you could give your current view on how that could play out over the next 12 to 18 months?","Brian Hancock","Sure. That\u2019s a great question. This is Brian again. Last \u2013 it\u2019s interesting. Last week, I spent the week with an entire every single day with a new set of customers. And the overwhelming message that we received from our customers was, we realized the environment is a little tenuous and there\u2019s a lot of things being said. But please make sure, you continue to invest in Mexico because, we\u2019re continuing to invest.","We see continued strength in many of the commodity markets that may have been a little weaker. There\u2019s a significant amount of product moving, as Pat said, South. The export volumes continue to be strong. And so we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re in a very good space. Our customers are continuing to invest. There\u2019s a lot of confidence that the issues that are out in the public right now will be resolved in a way that is better for both countries and for the companies that do business in them.","So right now, it was overwhelmingly positive. And this is, I would say, probably over 20 to 25 different customers that we met with last week. So we feel very good about 2017 and into the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","If you just exclude sort of the import business from Mexico, how does the growth of the rest of your base business look? I was wondering if you could sort of separate that out for investors, just sort of talk about some of the opportunities there going forward?","Brian Hancock","Jason, again, this is Brian. Thanks for the question. As Pat mentioned, about 60% of our business is southbound, so it\u2019s export from the U.S. into Mexico. That includes four of our big product lines. When you think about grain, it\u2019s obviously our largest. But intermodal and automotive parts going into Mexico, plastics, fuel, all of those industries will continue to ship into Mexico and grow. It\u2019s important to remember, Mexico has over 20, already trade agreements with other countries.","And so, Mexico, as it produces, it ships all over the world. And as they think about importing into the U.S., obviously, that\u2019s a key trading partner for them, and we continue to see investment in a number of different areas, when plastics go out of the U.S., then they come back in for other parts other things that we see. But I would tell you, overall, we continue to see our export business from the U.S. probably growing faster than our import business back into the U.S.","And then once they\u2019re in Mexico, there\u2019s a number of opportunities given to port structures that we\u2019re able to export into the rest of the world and we\u2019re able to touch some of that freight as well. So cross-border is a big space. We were up on our cross-border business 8% for the quarter. And so we feel very comfortable that that\u2019s going to continue to grow, both north and southbound.","Jason Seidl","Okay, thanks for that. And on my follow-up, I wanted to touch a little bit more on energy reform. I realize it\u2019s early on and it sounds like it could be lumpy as they roll out the zones. But could you talk about, from a modeling perspective, what we should be expecting, at least, from this initial facility, as it ramps up? I know you guys just sent the unit train. And how should we look at it, as we go out to 2018? Should we expect, at least, maybe another facility to potentially roll on them, or should we, at least, just sort of take the wait-and-see approach?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Jason, let me just address it in this way, because it\u2019s going to be very difficult for me to predict, or give you any type of guidance on, how fast will it roll out, how will each zone participate, and what would be the impacts. Basically, if you look at Slide 18, it gives you the 14 facilities that are on our line. Seven of those are already in operation. Several of them are primarily storage facilities that feed the distributors in particular geographic areas.","We do feel very comfortable that the pipeline system coming out of Veracruz is going to continue to be the primary source into Mexico City. And so when you think of rail, everything else that you see on this page is an opportunity for us. How it will roll out? How each individual region will go forward from a volume perspective? I really can\u2019t \u2013 I can\u2019t give you any prediction on that simply because it\u2019s going to be an interesting year.","But we do feel very, very comfortable that the politicians, the people inside the communities, they\u2019re very focused on making sure that they have enough refined products. Just to give you one point, you have to remember, the U.S. has about a 90- day supply of refined products. Mexico has a two-day supply of that.","And so it\u2019s important to realize the export from U.S. into Mexico is going to continue to be a very, very important part of the overall Mexico energy strategy. And you\u2019ll see, this will give you 14 facilities. I really can\u2019t tell you anything besides that.","Jason Seidl","Okay. I appreciate the color, guys, and thanks for the time.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thank you, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Danny Schuster","Hi good morning. This is Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking our question. So thank you very much for showing the mix of cross-border business on Slide 7. We found that extremely helpful. And we were just wondering, so if you\u2019re a net exporter to Mexico, how would a border adjustable tax system impact you?","Mike Upchurch","Well, this is Mike Upchurch. Obviously, that\u2019s just a concept at this point that we don\u2019t know exactly how that might play out and if it, we\u2019ll play out. But our view of that is, it would certainly make customers of ours produce less if they\u2019re importing into the U.S. And in general that concept is to tax imports and have a tax-free environment for export.","So, it would clearly be a negative if that were to occur. I think the challenge with that concept becomes, take the auto industry, as an example. How many parts go southbound? How many materials like chemicals and steel and plastics and get assembled and then back North? And certainly, the President-Elect made some comments about that being too complicated. But that would be our initial sense of the border tax.","Danny Schuster","Okay, great. That\u2019s a helpful clarification and certainly understand that it\u2019s still very uncertain at this point. And then just back to Slide 7, how \u2013 so of your overall revenue base, how much of that is represented by the cross-border traffic that you\u2019re showing on this slide? Does that question make sense there?","Mike Upchurch","Yes. And this slide represents a little bit different view of cross-border. When we talk about cross-border, historically, we have talked about the business that is handled by Kansas City Southern on both sides of the border. And so that did not include other cross-border traffic that was interchanged with primarily with the Union Pacific at Laredo. So the KCS cross-border only is about 20% \u2013 28%, 29% of our revenues. And when you add the other piece of it, it\u2019s in the low 40s.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Yes, thanks. Good morning.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee","I wanted to talk a little more about the volume outlook for 2017. So you gave a helpful slide and kind of everything in the neutral to positive dynamic. But wondered if maybe we could put a slightly finer point on that, when you think about the auto growth and we\u2019ve talked about what production looks like in Mexico in 2017. You have refined products. You have some intermodal opportunities, it seems. But when you start to think about that, do we think maybe mid single-digit? Is there a way to kind of get a little bit more granular in terms of what we should be expecting for total volume growth for the business in 2017?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Chris, I\u2019ll take that one. We\u2019re going to remain steadfast in our position that we\u2019re not going to give specific guidance. But clearly, when you look at the \u2013 just that one slide, it would certainly indicate that we expect 2017 to be better than 2018., sorry, 2017 to 2016. But until we get more in clarity on some of the environmental and other factors that are on the landscape, we\u2019re just going to kind of stay where we are.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. When you think about the \u2013 this is a follow-up. When you think about sort of some of this volume growth, and you talked a little bit about it in the fourth quarter. So it sounds like maybe there was a mix of maybe some customer facilities that weren\u2019t quite ready, but it ultimately ended up impacting the network negatively sort of the story here has been about the ramp up of volume, particularly in Mexico. As we think about 2017, how is the network sort of prepared for that volume? You\u2019d love to see the ability to sort of really leverage that opportunity, as we move through the year. I don\u2019t know if this is just initial growing pains we saw in the fourth quarter, or do we think that maybe some of this spills into 2017? Just want to get a sense of how that kind of plays out, and obviously, that has an impact on the operating ratio in 2017?","Jeff Songer","Yes, I\u2019ll take that. This is Jeff. So as I try to give a little color around more regional impact here, which is really what we\u2019re seeing. If you look at some of the other terminals in Mexico, San Luis Potosi in the kind of the heart of the country for us actually saw some improvement. Velocity, cars are getting over the line relatively well. And so I \u2013 it\u2019s not for me. It\u2019s not a system issue. It\u2019s not a symptom that won\u2019t be corrected here after some of this capacity comes on, on this kind of specific to that North region.","And as I mentioned, the volume in that territory, if I have one terminal, for example, Monterrey is the primary terminal that was impacted with the volume growth. That backs up towards the border that starts to impact Sanchez and Nuevo Laredo. So unfortunately, we lost a little bit of time. On the Sanchez yard, we\u2019ve got additional classification space here ready to open next month. I was hoping to have that in December, but we lost a little time due to the weather.","So certainly, we\u2019re looking at how we\u2019re strategically deploying a capital. Sanchez is first and foremost and will continue to be, in addition to the initial tracks opening here in February, we\u2019ll have another cut of tracks opening up probably early fall. So, we\u2019re trying to not do one large project and wait until it\u2019s all ready and opening up. We\u2019re trying to cut over tracks and get that capacity service as quickly as we can, which is really what we\u2019re going to see here starting next month.","Mike Upchurch","Chris, this is Mike. One other thing I might just comment. Our volumes in Mexico were up a little over 4%. And Jeff kept his T&E labor flat during the quarter. So, I think that that was a nice little productivity bump in the fourth quarter from a labor perspective.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. Pat, thanks for the detailed thoughts on Mexico, and your regulatory outlook. It was a great overview. But Brian, sticking with that for a minute on the auto side, you mentioned the big news on Ford withdrawal from San Luis Potosi and BMW, seems like they\u2019ve suffered from some tweets lately. But I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve made any changes to their production. Is that right? And then any updates on the timing or planned builds at Toyota, Mercedes, Infiniti? Just want to make sure we understand kind of the revised \u2013 any revised outlook if there is any. And are any other auto companies just because that\u2019s the biggest scale, is there anything else we\u2019re waiting to hear from?","Brian Hancock","Yes, absolutely, Ken, thanks for the question. Obviously, the Ford announcement was disappointing. It\u2019s \u2013 it was a very large facility. But when you look at it and understand the way the market is working and the small cars that were going to be built there, it makes sense. I think, Ford has said, it was a business decision, and I believe that it was. All of our other customers, I think that they are well attuned to what\u2019s being said. What\u2019s coming out on a daily basis.","But again, we met with a number of our automotive customers and very much in detail customer by customer specific conversation saying, hey, please make sure that you continue to invest in the infrastructure we needed. We continue to have plans. And so we have not seen any of the other facilities move. Certainly, the companies that you\u2019ve mentioned, there has been no announcement and we have not seen them hesitate. In fact, we\u2019ve actually received calls saying, hey don\u2019t. We understand what\u2019s being said. But we want to continue marching down the path that we have.","So we feel comfortable that we\u2019re well connected with our customers. They\u2019re helping us understand exactly how they\u2019re being impacted. We\u2019re doing the same for them. And I think, as was said in the opening comments, Pat being responsible as a Chair on the CEO Dialogue, our President Jose Zozaya down in Mexico very much staying attuned to what\u2019s going on politically. We\u2019re as close as we can be, and we continue to feel very comfortable in our support of the automotive industry and the intermodal industry that also supports those big plants. So that\u2019s where I would say.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I just chime in and add a couple of comments here. And that is, we are trying to stay very, very close to some of these major customers and projects, obviously. So that we are adjusting if necessary or appropriate our capital thought for the next two or three years and beyond.","And as Brian said, we\u2019re not getting any indication from some of these other opportunities in the pipeline that their plans have changed. So we need to be prepared for that business when it comes. Then on Ford, if \u2013 just another kind of color commentary. If you look at what they said when they made their announcement, it\u2019s all about the investment environment in the United States, is looking better to them. That plant was just begun construction.","And so they made a decision based on the outlook for the environment, the tax environment, the regulatory environment, that\u2019s all very positive. And I think if companies start to do that, it\u2019s going to result in the trade deficit eventually improving from the U.S. perspective. And we look at the opportunities that we\u2019re talking about and the opportunities for additional exports, we think that that\u2019s all going to be taken into consideration, as the policymakers began to work this issue through and come to what we think and what we hope is a reasonable outcome.","Ken Hoexter","Great. And if I can follow-up, it sounded like, Jeff, you were giving an answer to Chris on on kind of some of the updates in \u2013 on the network. But how \u2013 when you think about, how long does it take to get the network ready, when you\u2019re thinking about KIA, you\u2019ve talked about some of the KIA issues, I guess, Audi was launched after that. Is there, I mean, you\u2019ve had plenty of lead time on the opening a plant. I guess, I want to try to understand what was the surprise in Mexico? Did you get a larger share than you expected? Why was the network so I guess disjointed when you had all this influx of volume?","Jeff Songer","Yes. So I kind of \u2013 I try to provide some color around the \u2013 I would say very, very solid growth in the region of Monterrey, 20% growth, 27% on the Mexico ag side. So I want to say, a little bit of a storm with the auto plants. If you recall, early in the year, we had shutdown activity with autos, those all came online here, half to later in the year. The KIA is something we\u2019ve just kind of been, as I mentioned, been waiting pool for the facility to complete how that works.","They actually have their facility. They truck those automobiles into our Monterrey, downtown Monterrey terminal. We\u2019re handling them there, which is not ideal by any means. So it\u2019s creating some pressures there that, again, we look for some relief, as we look to move that operation back out to the KIA facility here in Q2. So really just a little bit of a storm with, I want to say, the volume in the regions in the Monterrey area.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. Wanted to get a little sense of some of the cost side items. I assume from you Mike, how do you look at per worker cost in 2017? I mean, you had a lot of noise from incentive comp moving up a lot this year. I think generally a weaker peso being helpful in terms of lower cost per worker. But I just that \u2013 there has been a lot of noise. How would you think about bottling the change in per worker comp benefit, broadly speaking in 2017?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, Tom, the challenge obviously in the comp and benefits line item when you look at the expenses is the incentive. If you exclude that and we did include a page, I guess, it\u2019s Slide 29, back in the appendix. You look at annually, we had about $14 million of wage inflation and combination of productivity improvements and labor reductions in the U.S. more than offset that actually $15 million of benefit.","So I think from a labor productivity perspective, we\u2019re certainly seeing that productivity, particularly on the U.S. side. I think on the Mexico side, with the influx of the volumes we saw here in the fourth quarter, we want to manage that correctly, given some of the issues we had late 2014, 2015. But I think, overall pretty decent performance when you look at the cost increases and the productivity improvements that we\u2019ve been able to generate out of Jeff\u2019s organization.","Tom Wadewitz","So if you look at where the peso is today, and if you look at it, you ran at a pretty high incentive comp level in 2016. Would you say it\u2019s reasonable that comp per worker could actually be down year-over-year in 2017?","Mike Upchurch","Well, a lot of that\u2019s going to be dependent on volumes. I mean, we would expect right now comp and benefits to be up probably low single digits. In 2017, we do have some health and welfare costs going up, medical benefits that are going to hit us there. Obviously, you get the benefit of the incentive going back to 100, and the wage inflation, we have a pretty good handle on that. But I think you probably ought to assume just slight increases in comp and benefits going into 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning.","Brian Hancock","Good morning.","Brian Ossenbeck","So when you look at the some of these new volumes, refined products, and plastics, I think you called out like a 4% of CapEx has gone to rolling stock. Are there any bottlenecks or limitations when it comes to what appears to be the immediate need to move refined product into Mexico? Is that \u2013 does the government have the tank cars? Is that something that refiners are supplying?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Brian, this is Brian. Thanks for the question. I think the only bottleneck is really the capacity to unload and store refined products at the rate necessary, as the government starts to role things out. And so that\u2019s where you see all of the investment. That\u2019s why we wanted to provide the chart on Page 18. It\u2019s literally from a rolling stock perspective. Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of tank cars in the environment right now.","So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue. But I would tell you, everyone is focused on making sure that you\u2019re able to transload specifically off of rail into truck and into the district distribution system. So I think that\u2019s the bottleneck, and that\u2019s why again, I think our investment in the Watco, WTC, KCS terminal is so important, because it allows us to create a destination, where we can really offload and get that moving as quickly as possible.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And then just a follow-up on just the energy reform, in general. I know there\u2019s commentary about how \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. But how does Pemex in their new form factor to enter into this equation? I know they have some regional stores, the cars that might be an opportunity. We\u2019ve got the first open season ending in mid-February could actually be a competitor in some of these areas? Just kind of the early thoughts on them kind of and then your shape in form would be helpful, as we look at this evolve in the next 12 to 24 months? Thanks.","Brian Hancock","Yes, Brian, that\u2019s a great question. Thank you. Pemex is an environment. It\u2019s difficult for them to really understand how they want to move forward in particular markets. What I would tell you is, they\u2019ve been more than helpful for us and for others in helping open up the market to the global pricing and the way that the gold works from a crude perspective, from a refined products perspective. And I would continue to see them as a large store of facilities. I know that their refineries many people have discussed in the press about the shape of those refineries.","But I would tell you, they\u2019re focused on making sure that Mexico has all of the refined products necessary whether it\u2019s to import into storage facilities that already exist for them, or by reworking their refineries. We see that on a number of the refiners that we support. But right now, I think, we\u2019re working well with Pemex and most of the other companies are as well. But will there be significant change in the retail space? All signs are pointing to, there will be significant change from a midstream distribution perspective.","I think that there are a lot of companies trying to understand who have received their product from Pemex that may not be able to get in the future, where they\u2019re going to get that product. And so I think that\u2019s a key. But again, I think the parties are working well together. And over the next year, it\u2019s certainly going to be an interesting time. There will certainly be things that we didn\u2019t foresee coming.","But overall, I think it\u2019s going to be very positive for the country. I think it\u2019s certainly going to be positive for KCS. And I think Pemex is going to come out of it as well as a better stronger company, focused on what they do best the Mexican population. So that\u2019s where I would say with Pemex.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning, everyone. And Pat, very important question for you Do you mind sharing your Twitter handle with everyone on this call, because I think we\u2019re going to get quite a bit views out there.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","It\u2019s top secret.","Brandon Oglenski","Look, with all the back and forth on NAFTA, I mean, has this shaped the strategic direction inside Kansas City Southern? I mean, are you guys now looking at the export energy market as potentially being a bigger opportunity than maybe say autos was for this company two or three years ago, I mean, or has nothing really changed that drastically the way you look at the future of your company?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d say, it\u2019s more along the the latter, where as I said earlier, we\u2019re trying to stay very close to our customers. So that we understand, if they\u2019re making any changes. Do we need to consider that in our capital planning, resource planning? And as Brian mentioned so far, we\u2019ve really other than a couple of announcements that are pretty highly publicized, we haven\u2019t seen that.","We\u2019re also trying to stay as active and involved with policymakers, our friends in the Senate and Congress. There\u2019s just going to be a lot of interest, as this moves forward as we begin to engage with those policy members, both individually and through organizations like the CEO Dialogue. This is an important topic for the AAR. According to the AAR, 30% of all class one carloads are connected to international trade. So we know that this is one of their top agenda items for 2017, as well.","So and until we kind of know exactly what we\u2019re faced with, our strategy is pretty much the same. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in those facilities that are going to drive our growth. And again until we have better facts to make any changes, we\u2019ll do that when we feel it\u2019s appropriate.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. But in terms of the capital outlook and where you\u2019re going to allocate your incremental dollars, that that hasn\u2019t changed in the last six months?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","No.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. And then\u2026","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Obviously, with Ford making their decision, we\u2019ve taken a look at the capital that we were planning to support that facility, but that really wasn\u2019t a 2017 capital item. So but there has been no changes in the last six months that that will affect our capital outlook solely related to the NAFTA discussion.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. And Mike, if I can just ask one on fuel real quick. Look, I\u2019m just a simple transport analyst, but we\u2019re having a hard time here understanding what\u2019s going on with the fuel price situation in Mexico. So I understand the caps are going up. You\u2019re going to get the excise tax credit this year. But how does everything change into 2018 if we go into an open market? Does your fuel spent then conceptually come down and you lose the tax credit, how do we think about this from a modeling perspective?","Mike Upchurch","Yes. Well, you\u2019re not the only one that\u2019s unsure about that environment, believe me. We spent a lot of time on this internally trying to understand that. But clearly, their stated plan is to eliminate any kind of price controls effective January 1, 2018, and they\u2019re beginning to migrate, as Brian and I both indicated throughout the course of 2017. We honestly don\u2019t know what the eye ups will be as a percent of the price of fuel. In the U.S., we pay excise taxes today on a gallon, and will the federal government kind of bring that number down to a comparable level, we don\u2019t know for sure what the answer is.","So, for 2017, again, just summarizing we believe that that we\u2019re going to get the credit again that that\u2019s been decided. We think it\u2019s going to be about $60 million. Prices are going up. We have a lot of flexibility in terms of our business model and where we buy that fuel. So we can take advantage of the inter-region and even cross-border strategies. We\u2019re moving a lot of refined product or hope to be moving a lot of refined product on behalf of our customers, where we could potentially work with them to procure that fuel.","We obviously have a fuel surcharge program in place in Mexico that helps cover some of those cost increases, and we\u2019re going to be managing this very, very diligently. But I can\u2019t give you the answer to the crystal ball what happens January 1, because I don\u2019t think anybody really has communicated that from the Mexican government.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. So first, maybe to follow-up on an earlier question on auto. Last quarter you talked about your expectation for growth in this business in 2017 to be pretty similar to the 20% increase in Mexican auto production. Is that still the case? And should we see growth above that in the first quarter just given the shutdowns you experienced last year?","Brian Hancock","Justin, this is Brian. Certainly, we have not changed our outlook for 2017 on the automotive grow. We still feel very comfortable. And obviously, last year in Q1 and Q2, we were experiencing a number of outages and plant shutdown. As you can see by the numbers, our volumes continue to be good. Even in the fourth quarter, we saw strong volume and we think we will continue to see that in into 2017. Beyond that, obviously, we\u2019re not giving any guidance on that. But we feel like we\u2019re in line with 2017, yes.","Justin Long","Okay.","Brian Hancock","And we\u2019re off to a great start in January. So, obviously, three weeks doesn\u2019t make a quarter, but we\u2019re seeing tremendous growth in the auto sector. We\u2019re right where we thought we would be.","Justin Long","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, I wanted to ask about the peso. You mentioned the peso remains weak, and I know there\u2019s not a direct impact to operating income. But could you just provide an update on the percentage of your volumes or revenue. It could face an increase competitive dynamic from a weaker peso and how much of that is factored into the 2017 volume outlook that you provided?","Mike Upchurch","Well, let me take a stab at this. This is Mike, and let Brian chime in. I think generally speaking, the peso from a competitive perspective has been most challenging in our intermodal business South of the border. And the truckers bill in pesos, we bill in U.S. dollars to our big shippers, and that obviously creates a dynamic, where trucking is more advantageous from a cost perspective. But that\u2019s not the only factor in a customer\u2019s decision. There\u2019s certainly security and service that we believe we have done a good job selling to, I give the intermodal marketing team a lot of credit for trying to hold the line on pricing. Once you reduce pricing, it\u2019s difficult, I think, to come back.","And so while we\u2019ve experienced a little bit of share loss there, you can look at the results at the port at L\u00e1zaro, while our share has dropped a little bit. We recovered in the back-half of the year. We\u2019re back above 50%, slightly above 50% of the inland containers. And so I think that\u2019s an indication that we are weathering the storm to the best of our ability. And the only thing I would add in is that, you have to remember, as you look at the intermodal market overall, one of the biggest costs when competing against trucking is fuel. And in Mexico those truckers just took a pretty significant fuel increase, where when you think about rail, we\u2019ve got locomotives that are already going up that hill. We know where they\u2019re going and we\u2019d love to put more on there.","So I think we become more competitive as they have to face that particular issue. So we feel very comfortable in our intermodal space. We\u2019ve got some great new products across the border and the new terminal. So we feel good about where we\u2019re at in competing against that peso deterioration that you see.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","If you go back to Mike\u2019s comment about security, the cost differential of moving a truck versus a container might be measured in tens of dollars, where the value particularly we\u2019re talking about how high value cargo like electronics or apparel, the value of a single container if it experiences some sort of theft or damages could overwhelm the cost advantage on hundreds of containers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Yi with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Ivan Yi","Great. Good morning, guys.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning.","Ivan Yi","Could you please give us a breakdown of \u2013 good morning. Could you please give us a breakdown of your CapEx between the U.S. and Mexico? We\u2019re just wondering why you haven\u2019t lowered your CapEx guidance a little bit more, given the excess equipment and particularly the political uncertainty?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Well, we don\u2019t report separately the segments between the U.S. and Mexico. But Jeff, if you want to add some color?","Jeff Songer","We provided a little color on the specific numbers. The Sasol project in the U.S. is another very big hitter for 2017, that really goes away in 2017. PTC, as I\u2019ve said, is another, I\u2019ll frame up around $16 million, I think we\u2019ve kind of talked about that. Again for 2017, that should roughly cut in half or a little better even into 2018.","So you\u2019ve still got a couple of big drivers in those two categories. The Sanchez, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve talked about the capacity and we\u2019re going to continue to look and invest where we need to. We\u2019re still have pretty good expenditures here into 2017. So a couple of big drivers of that being offset, as I mentioned, no locomotive purchases, reduced infrastructure.","Ivan Yi","Great. And\u2026","Patrick Ottensmeyer","And our volumes in Mexico were growing, as we mentioned earlier, in the Northern part of the region, the three terminals that we used to serve the Northern region volumes in those terminals were up \u2013 was up 19% in the fourth quarter. So there\u2019s still a lot of growth going on. Refined products, plastics, we see opportunities for export growth there. And you\u2019re right about the political uncertainty, but it is that, it is uncertainty. So until we have better clarity and certainty on what is actually going to happen, we need to make the investments to support our customers.","Ivan Yi","Great, thank you. And for a follow-up, can you talk a bit more about your coal business and specifically your expectations for Luminant this year and beyond? Thank you.","Brian Hancock","This is Brian. Our coal business, as I said, was down significantly this year. We don\u2019t see it returning to the level that we saw in 2014 and 2015. We\u2019re continuing to work with our carrier partners with the other customers to provide some creative solutions. But we still very \u2013 feel very comfortable that we\u2019ll be able to make sure this business moves when it\u2019s available and that that\u2019s a tough market. It\u2019s moving around a lot and but we\u2019re going to play, where we think that we can play correctly at the right pricing levels. And right now we feel like we\u2019re in a good spot with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for putting me here. So just a couple of follow-ups. I think in response to one of, I think, it was Ken\u2019s question earlier on autos, I agree with you, guys. I think the Ford announcement was more about the cycle and what\u2019s happening with auto demand rather than anything to do with the new administration\u2019s policies. But what\u2019s the risk that that becomes an even bigger risk, in that, as per our numbers, at least, I think a majority of the new volumes coming out of Mexico in the next three, four years are all in that same BC segment, that Ford kind of targeted. Is there a risk that kind of where the auto cycle is going and with gas prices, that some of your volumes don\u2019t materialize, having nothing to do with the new administration\u2019s policies?","Brian Hancock","Ravi, I\u2019ll go back to \u2013 that\u2019s a great question, but I\u2019ll go back to the conversations we had last week. We just do not get that sense from our customers. They\u2019re extremely focused on providing to the markets that they sell to and that they focus on. Some of the new plants are more in the luxury space. And so we don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re going to be impacted at the same rate that you might have seen the cars that were planned to be in the Ford facility.","We have a lot of larger vehicles, SUVs, in the plants that we serve. So right now, we feel very comfortable in the markets that we serve with the facilities that we serve. And overall, our automotive business should grow at the rate that we discussed earlier.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. And a couple of quick housekeeping ones, if I may. I think you said earlier in the call that your pricing was up 3% in the quarter. Is that excluding the large industrial customer that you are kind of, that\u2019s kind of going through difficulty that you\u2019re helping right now? And also, just to clarify on the excise fuel tax credit, how are you still going to get the same amount of excise fuel tax credit in 2017 as 2016, when we are kind of going through market pricing in 2017 by region?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, Ravi, I\u2019ll handle the pricing question, and then I\u2019ll let Mike take the other \u2013 the last part of your question. From a pricing perspective, as we said, we felt very comfortable with our core pricing at 3%. We believe that we will do better than that next year and that\u2019s across all of our customer base.","So overall, we\u2019re not going to give anymore guidance than that. But we feel very comfortable that we understand the markets, where we play and where we need to be priced to continue to move the product in an efficient way for our customers. So I think the guidance that we gave of, yes, third quarter \u2013 our fourth quarter was 3%, and we will either be at that or exceed that for next year, I feel comfortable with that.","Mike Upchurch","Ravi, this is Mike. On the IEPS, our assumptions here, we do have a fixed price per gallon on the IEPS that\u2019s been communicated to us. So then you\u2019ve got a combination of volume growth that would take that number up and for an exchange that would take that number back down. So we\u2019ve tried to give you the best estimate that we have on what that IEPS credit would be and it\u2019s about $60 million.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler Brown","Hey, good morning, guys.","Brian Hancock","Hi, Tyler.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Tyler.","Tyler Brown","Hey, Mike, I just wanted some clarification on incentive comp. So it looks like it was up, say, $35 million or so for the year. But it also sounded like your accrual was greater than 100%. Can you just give us the delta on incentive comp if you accrued kind of normal if you hit budget next year?","Mike Upchurch","The delta in terms of dollars or\u2026?","Tyler Brown","Yes.","Mike Upchurch","Yes, approximately $25 million would be a 100% in our income statement. And of course, on the 2016, that\u2019s still subject to our Board of Directors approval. And we\u2019ll communicate what that percentage is in the proxy.","Tyler Brown","Okay. Okay, good. And then Mike, just a big picture question on CapEx. And I appreciate that you are just now giving 2017 CapEx. But it sounds like Sasol, Sanchez, PTC, all of these kind of largely conclude in 2017. I mean, in 2018, should we \u2013 assuming nothing new comes online, I mean, should we be expecting a big material drop in CapEx in 2018?","Mike Upchurch","Well, I think it\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re going to be done with the Sasol Lake Charles project, and we still have some PTC spend, but not at the levels that we\u2019re anticipating in 2017. So you could take that capital number down roughly $115 million. But certainly, we hope to be growing this business again, as we are here in January that is going to continue to require freight cars equipment, potentially locomotives, we still have a number of those parts. But be a nice problem to have if we\u2019re buying locomotives in 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ve come to the end of our time for questions. Mr. Ottensmeyer, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay, thank you, and thank you, everyone, for your time and attention. I realize there are a couple of people that will circle back with offline.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the Company which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC.

All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, you may begin.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and welcome to the Kansas City Southern second quarter earnings conference call. Slide 4 just lists the presenters for today. The same cast and characters you\u2019ve become familiar. So I won\u2019t introduce them. ","We\u2019ll go directly to Slide 5, which summarizes our results for the quarter. I am just going to cover a few highlights and the rest of the team will get into much more detail. With revenue growth of 15% and volumes up 6%, this was clearly the strongest growth quarter we have seen in more than two years.","With the exception of our Intermodal business, the strength was broad based across all of our major business segments. Our Intermodal business is clearly gaining momentum over the course of the quarter. As an example, volumes in the month of June were 6% higher than June of 2016. That momentum and growth has continued in the early weeks of the third quarter as well. ","Brian will have much more to say about our Intermodal business in a few minutes. The operating ratio for the quarter was 63.5%, which was 220 basis points higher than what we reported in the second quarter of last year. I will briefly remind you that there were a number of timing-related items included in the second quarter of 2016 that had an impact of reducing our operating ratio last year. ","We feel very good about the 63.5% OR for this quarter. It\u2019s clean and solid and reflects the positive volume and pricing environment which we are currently enjoying, but also reflects that Jeff Songer and his team are delivering strong operating performance. Again, Mike will have \u2013 Mike Upchurch will have more to say about the timing events that I mentioned in a few minutes.","I also want to call out the operating income with an all-time record for any quarter at $239 million, a 9% improvement over the second quarter of last year. We are very pleased with the positive momentum demonstrated by our operating team, as we have promised in the last couple of earnings calls, our operating metrics including terminal dwell are trending in the right direction and our network today is performing at a high level. ","Finally, earnings per share came in at a $1.27, which was a record for any second quarter and 14% higher than last year. Again Mike will walk you through some of those timing-related items that I referred to earlier from last year and those would suggest that our core EPS growth was actually higher than the 14% that we reported. ","Last quarter I suggested that the headline for our performance was solid and clean. Those words still apply to the second quarter, but I would add that we are gaining momentum both on the business side and on the operating side. And most of the storm clouds that have darkened our skies for the past few quarters appear to dissipating. ","The only need to look at the substantial appreciation of the Mexican Peso since the beginning of the year to conclude that the sentiment toward NAFTA and more importantly, trade relationships with Mexico has improved significantly. ","If you haven\u2019t already seen that there is a great opinion piece in today\u2019s Wall Street Journal with which we read it wholeheartedly. I\u2019ll come back to that in my concluding comments and now will turn the presentation over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Songer ","Thank you, Pat and good morning. Reviewing the key operating metrics for the quarter on Slide 7, velocity has remained relatively consistent over the past several quarters, although we did see some decline during the quarter mainly attributed to heavy unscheduled and seasonable traffic in the U.S. As Brian will highlight in energy carloads increased 41% from prior year.","Dwell for the quarter of 22.2 hours was consistent with the prior year. The Mexico terminals did showed marked improvements over the past few months. Factors contributing to this improvement include completion of additional capacity projects in Northern Mexico, auto and grain facilities. KIA has completed the first phase of their track construction and we have started to shift our operation into that terminal.","Improved management, additional capacity at Sanchez and cross border operating improvements are all having positive impacts on our performance. Other capacity projects completed in the past few weeks and includes 6 miles of double track in the San Louis area that supports fluidity in the automotive segment and a new 10,000 foot siding in the Port of Lazaro Cardenas. ","Turning to Slide 8, in U.S. we have recalled most of the furloughed crews to handle the increased bulk and seasonal volume while 8% of locomotives remain in storage. Productivity improvements during the quarter enabled us to handle 6% more volume with a 3% headcount increase. ","Including those in-sourcing in mechanical operations in Mexico, a portion of the increase in headcount related to additional PTC support positions in the U.S. and additional resources for our Mexico Network Operating Center, which has had a direct contribution to the performance improvements in Mexico. ","PTC will create additional demand on crews and locomotives as we ramp up our implementation, the resources are aligned to support this effort. We recently received approval from the FRA to begin revenue service testing on six sub-divisions, and we are on track with our overall PTC implementation schedule. ","Mike will provide additional detail regarding PTC financial impact in a few minutes. Capital outlook for 2017 remains unchanged at $550 million to $560 million. Remaining track work in Sanchez yard will complete this fall and new mechanical and fueling facilities in the terminals should complete by mid-2018. ","This will complete the current planned expansion work at Sanchez, however, we have ample space in this facility to continue to add infrastructure as volume requires. There is no change to the outlook for Sasol terminal project, which continued on schedule for completion late in 2017. ","I will close with a quick overview of our cross border operation similar to what we saw last quarter, total train volume all within the railroad gateway grew substantially with total trains count increasing by 15% versus Q2 2016. Time to process trains across the bridge, which is a measure of the time it takes to change crews and to complete customs processes improved 13% for South bound traffic and 5% for North bound traffic. ","These service improvements have been achieved through efficient operational management and work conducted by our process improvement team. The continued improvement in South bound traffic is also related to the additional capacity in Sanchez yard which allows more trains to arrive directly into the yard without waiting for other trains to depart. ","Two additional projects that should continue to support our cross border growth are the implementation of international crews and co-location of Mexico and U.S. Customs facilities. Pilot test for each of these initiatives will begin in Q3. ","We were encouraged by the United States Trade Office summary of objectives for NAFTA released last week calling for streamlining and automation of customs processes. These objectives should continue to support our current and future initiatives for cross border shipments. ","I will now turn the presentation to over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock. ","Brian Hancock","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start my comments on Page 10, where you can see second quarter year-over-year revenue was up 15% and volumes were up 6%. Revenue continue to be negatively impacted by foreign exchange, but was more than offset by strong growth from five of our six business units. ","We also saw strong revenue per unit growth in spite of the foreign exchange drag driven by strengthening fuel prices and positive mix impacts. Core pricing also continued to be positive. ","Our energy line of business saw revenue growth of over 100% in utility coal, frac sand, and crude oil for an overall year-over-year increase of 90%. Positive pricing and fuel surcharge drove revenue growth along with improved length of haul this quarter due to more of the business having a final destination in Texas. ","13% revenue growth in our chemical and petroleum business unit was primarily driven by the heavy fuel oil shipments along with solid performance on our south bound refined products and LPG business driven by the new Mexico Energy Reform. We also had a strong quarter and length of haul in this segment. ","Automotive revenue was up 29% over 2016, driven primarily by volumes compared with temporary plant shutdowns we experienced in Q2 of 2016. We also had good volumes from new plant openings and growth in production from existing plants. The Industrial and Consumer segment also showed improvement in the second quarter with a volume increase of 4% and 9% revenue growth.","We had our strongest quarter in nine years from military shipments coupled with strong quarter in cement. Our paper volumes were also up due to temporary plant shutdowns we had in Q2 of 2016. We saw continued strength in our Ag and minerals line of business with 7% year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter, primarily driven by length of haul and pricing. ","With revenue and volume decreases of 1%, our Intermodal business continues to see stiff competition from low trucking rates and ocean shipping consolidation. ","On Page 11, you can see our outlook for the second half of 2017 from a volume perspective. Our Intermodal business is expected to pick up in the second half with continued growth in our Automotive business at the UP, growth of our BNSF cross border service offering and shipments from the new operator at the Port of Lazaro Cardenas. ","Chemical and petroleum will continue to show growth due to the refined product shipments as well as the ethylene crackers coming online over the next 24 months. Our Automotive business will be up year-over-year as we continue to see solid growth in this business segment driven by additional manufacturing capacity and improvements in our service.","Our energy comps get more difficult, leading to a slight year-over-year volume decline in the second half in utility coal. With that said, we should see sequential coal volume growth in the second half driven by stable natural gas prices and low inventories across plants that we serve. ","Additionally, stable crude prices are driving continued demand for frac sand and our outlook for crude continues to be positive as well. Ag volumes should be flat year-over-year, but due to the completion of a new soy processing facility in Monterey, we will see a change in the way beans and meal are shipped over the next few quarters. ","Industrial and consumer will see volatility in the short-term as both steel and paper markets continue to see significant pressure on pricing against the truck market. We can see some upside to this outlook from military and cement shipments. ","On Page 12, there is a graphical representation of KCS\u2019s non-vessel-oriented intermodal strategy. The important message from this slide is that KCS now has effective Intermodal products for all of our customers. The cross border franchise business continues to grow with the new BSNF service, we continue to be pleased with the customer response for the product and all the parties are prepared for the busy retail season that starts in the third quarter. ","The cross border interchange business with our partner Union Pacific also continues to show strength with increased automotive production in Mexico and the benefits that this service provides to our customers in the Midwest and western states. ","We are now working with all of the major IMCs and are able to provide our customers with access to the key railroads in important destinations throughout all of the U.S. and Mexico. ","We believe to being a good provider to all of the North American rail partners, as well as being able \u2013 and willing to work with all of the major IMCs allows us to serve customers with the most effective and efficient solutions possible. ","Slide 13 provides an update on our Mexico Energy Reform and its impact on our current results. As you can see, sequentially, we have seen an increase of 255% in revenue and 223% in carloads. 40% of our energy reform shipments year-to-date have been liquid refined products including diesel and unleaded fuel. ","These products and primarily bound for the new Howard facility in San Jos\u00e9 Iturbide. 53% of the energy reform carloads have been moving LPGs, which are used extensively in the residential areas of Mexico. We received most of these shipments from our partner interchanges in St. Louis and Kansas City bounds for existing facilities and numerous cities in Mexico. ","We thought we might also provide a few keys to success to watch for in this important new business. Rail will be a critical part of the new Mexico Energy Reform and supply chain. To complete long \u2013 to compete long-term, we must have origin and destination facilities that can handle unit train capacity on a daily basis, manifest service to small tanks will create a significant cost hurdle to customers competing in the refined products retail market. ","We also believe that destination facilities must have both trans load and storage capabilities to make the facilities attractive to a broader set of distributors and suppliers. Security and product safety are essential and we believe rail holds a significant advantage over other trans and options. ","We also know that being able to survey relatively large geographic area from a single facility will create the density necessary to establish a long-term low cost solution. ","The market already recognizes that current market consumption will need to be supported by additional storage capacity, as well as enhanced distribution models throughout Mexico. This capacity will help ensure quality and security all the way from the Gulf refineries to the retail locations throughout the country. ","And with that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Michael Upchurch","Thanks, Brian and good morning everyone. I am going to start my comments on Slide 15. Second quarter volumes increased 6% and revenue increased 15%. Operating ratio did increase from 61.3% in the second quarter a year ago 63.5% for the current second quarter. ","I would remind everyone that in the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $34 million credit in operating income when we determined, we could utilize the Mexican fuel excise tax credit that included $17 million related to the first quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we experienced a $2 million loss on operating income from foreign exchange and we\u2019ve provided additional details in the appendix on Pages 28 and 29. ","Despite that FX loss, we are encouraged by the recent improvement in the peso to about 17.5 as the NAFTA rhetoric has been replaced with enthusiasm by the U.S. NAFTA renegotiation objectives being centered around ecommerce, financial services, telecommunications, and intellectual property. ","Excluding FX and fuel excise tax credits, our incremental margins were above 50% and sequentially, our incremental margins were over 60%. I\u2019ll cover the excise tax impacts more on the next slide to help you evaluate our operating income performance. ","Reported EPS was $1.27 up 14% and on an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.33 in the current quarter, up 9% from second quarter 2016. More income statement details including the gains and losses of foreign exchange can be found in the appendix on Slides 25 and 26. ","On Slide 16, to provide more insight into second quarter OR and adjusted EPS, we have provided a reconciliation to the prior year that includes the improvement in operating income with and without the $17 million fuel excise tax benefit we recorded a year ago that related to the first quarter 2016. ","And you might remember from our earnings call last year, we determined our ability to utilize the credit during the second quarter, which included retroactive application to January 1 of 2016.","Moving to expenses on Slide 16, 2Q operating expenses increased 20%. However, on a year-over-year basis, expense comparisons were negatively impacted by both lower fuel tax credits and insurance recoveries booked in 2016. Fuel excise tax credits were $21 million lower, $17 million from the previously discussed 2Q 2016 credit that related to the first quarter and $4 million from lower excise tax rates.","We continue to expect our full year fuel excise tax credit to be approximately $45 million to $50 million. Fuel prices also contributed to $12 million in higher fuel costs, while fuel consumption increased $7 million. Our comps were negatively impacted by the $5 million insurance recovery we recognized in the year ago second quarter. ","Finally, we also experienced expense increases in depreciation, volume-based car hire and incentive compensation. And one additional point on expenses, we expect 2017 operating expenses related to PTC to be an approximate $9 million headwind escalating to approximately $30 million in 2018 and peaking at approximately $40 million in 2019. ","Turning to compensation on Slide 18, compensation and benefits increased 15% as a result of $4 million in wage inflation, $4 million in incentive compensation, $3 million in benefit costs, $3 million in incremental headcount, and $2 million in incremental headcount as a result of the car repair facility in-sourcing we completed in the fourth quarter of 2016.","As you can see in the bar chart, excluding the in-sourcing, our average employee headcount went up 3% well below our stated goal of keeping headcount growth below volume growth. ","Turning to Slide 19, fuel expense increased 28% driven by higher fuel prices and higher consumption. Fuel prices increased both in Mexico and the U.S. from an average of $1.97 a gallon a year ago, to $2.22 for 2Q 2017. And consumption was driven by the 6% increase in carloads and a 15% increase in gross ton miles.","Turning to Slide 20, purchased services decreased $3 million. Our in-sourcing and renegotiation of maintenance contracts provided $11 million year-over-year savings. Offsetting those savings were largely volume-based increases of $3 million in hire car repairs and $2 million in trackage rights fees. Materials and other increased $8 million. Materials for repairs increased $6 million due to the need to stock parts for our in-source maintenance operations. ","And as a reminder, we recorded a $5 million insurance recovery in second quarter of 2016 related to flooding from March of 2016. That was offset by an incremental $3 million of flooding cost for a separate event in June of 2016. ","And finally on Slide 21, I would like to discuss our capital allocation priorities. First and foremost, we will continue to invest in capital projects that present good growth opportunities for our franchise. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be in the range of our guidance of $550 million to $560 million. ","It is important to note that 2017 should be the third year in a row of declines in our CapEx spend and as a percentage of revenue. In addition to our capital expenditures, we expect to invest approximately $20 million in Phase one of the refined product terminal in St. Louis. ","As for shareholder returns, our commitment to return capital to our shareholders started in 2012 with the establishment of a dividend and in 2015, with a $500 million share repurchase program that we just concluded in June. During that timeframe, we repurchased 5.6 million shares at an average price of $89.25, slightly below the volume weighted average price. ","And with four new Board members at KCS since our last Board Meeting in May, we will have discussions in an upcoming Board Meeting to assess capital allocation strategies going forward. Finally, we feel very comfortable with our debt restructuring and our credit metrics, our leverage ratio is now in the low twos and we have an FFO-to-debt ratio in the low to mid-30s. ","Both of which are better than the median within the Class 1 sector and better than all of the BBB+ rated rails. This provides us ample financial flexibility for future capital allocation strategies. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Pat. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay, thanks, Mike. Before I open the call to questions, I just wanted to comment on a few topics that I believe will be on your list of potential questions. First is, NAFTA and I already talked about this to some degree in the opening comments and Jeff did as well. We are very pleased by the publication earlier this week from the US Trade representative with a list of priorities. ","I don\u2019t see any significant concerns with that document. The reaction in Mexico appears to have been positive as well. But we are not completely out of the woods yet. All indications are positive and as you all probably know, the process moves forward with the private negotiations taking place beginning in the middle of August. ","COFECE, the anti-trust second topic, anti-trust investigation in Mexico really not much new since our earlier statement. There is a very good disclosure in our 10-Q which will be published later this morning and that\u2019s really about all we are prepared to say on that since the investigation is still ongoing. So I would advise you not to waste your precious time with questions on that topic. ","Share repurchase, as Mike mentioned, we\u2019ve completed the $500 million program that we had authorized and we are going to continue discussions with our Board. As Mike mentioned, we have four new Board members. We thought it was proper to include them in the discussion and we will do that at our next Board Meeting and advice after that discussion.","And then finally, just picking up on that, the Board\u2019s constitution, as you saw a press release in May, I think May 30th, we\u2019ve added four new directors, which we feel add considerable expertise, business acumen, leadership and diversity to our Board. As our Chairman Bob Druten stated in that May 30th press release, these four new directors complement and enhance the skill sets of our current directors and put us in very good shape from a Board strength perspective for the years ahead. ","So with that, I will open it up to questions and see what\u2019s on your mind.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Allison Landry ","Thanks, good morning. So, cross border intermodal volumes in the second quarter recorded the highest in absolute terms that you\u2019ve ever moved and even year-over-year and sequential changes were very strong. Assuming this is largely a result of the new service with BNFS, how should we think about the incremental growth in the second half? And then, more importantly, where could we see that 2.5% market share that you had at the end of 2016 at cross border. Where could that go in the next two to three years?","Brian Hancock","Thanks, Allison. I\u2019ll take this. This is Brian. Obviously, we are very pleased with the results of the new service. It certainly is impacting us from a cross border perspective. We continue to believe it\u2019s going to grow. Obviously, the largest opportunity is truck conversion to rail. And so, we are completely focused on that. ","I think, it\u2019s important to go back to the slide where we talked about the number of IMCs that are now moving on that service as well the service with the UP and the diversity that we have from a box perspective. We see that business continuing to grow. How high will it grow, how far will it go will really depend on how much we are able to convert off of truck. ","We feel like we\u2019ve had a great season if you will in the bid processes and we look forward to the growth that\u2019s going to happen. But I think you will see, it will continue to grow and I think as Jeff mentioned, the service continues to provide consistency and something that customers couldn\u2019t depend on. So, we are excited about the growth and I think it\u2019s going to continue into the next year, year-and-a-half significantly at the rate that you see.","Allison Landry ","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And I apologize if I missed this from the comment before, but could you guys give a core pricing number in the quarter?","Brian Hancock","We did not. But is going to be \u2013 I am going to say mid to low single-digits. We are very pleased with that and we are going to continue to see core pricing where it needs to be. It\u2019s very similar. We want to be inflation plus and we are continuing to see that. ","Michael Upchurch","Yes, I would say, it\u2019s Mike. 3% was our same-store sales and our renewals were a little bit higher than that. ","Allison Landry ","Okay, is that consistent with what you saw in the first quarter?","Michael Upchurch","Yes.","Brian Hancock","Yes. ","Allison Landry ","Okay, got it. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. ","Brian Konigsberg","Yes, hi, good morning. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning. ","Brian Konigsberg","I just wanted to ask about, with the movements of the peso, I imagine that your service is becoming a bit more competitive in Mexico versus truck. I just want to get your view on how that might impact your intermodal into the second half?","Jeffrey Songer","Brian, thanks. The only thing I can tell you is, we are very pleased with the way the peso is moving. But you really, we are going to have to see still a number of points from a peso reduction before we are going to be able to be completely competitive. It certainly helps us in certain markets and allows us to move forward in those markets, but, obviously, truck pricing is going to be very, very competitive and so you get back around the 2015 type environment from a peso perspective. So, that\u2019s kind of where we sit. ","Michael Upchurch","Brian, this is Mike. I think we\u2019ve always said that L\u00e1zaro is probably the perfect place where we will stand what happens, because of currency and thoroughly we\u2019ve lost some share there over the last two to three years as the peso slid, what almost 22 earlier this year. Now, back at 17.5. We have seen growth return to L\u00e1zaro and as Brian mentioned, some new bookings that we\u2019re excited about. ","So, hopefully that that currency, it\u2019s always hard to isolate it to one single factor, but god bless our intermodal team that\u2019s had to deal with this currency for the last few years, but hopefully, we will see that accelerate now in growth. ","Brian Konigsberg","Great. And maybe just following up on just L\u00e1zaro on just with the APM terminal and that ramping up maybe some updated thoughts on how that progresses into the second half and maybe into next year. If you could quantify anything that would be great?","Jeffrey Songer","Brian, what I would say is the L\u00e1zaro terminal is now moving freight. We are seeing excellent growth. Obviously, there is a lot of share shift going down there with the terminal providers and so, we are really going to see that that improvement is going to be in the second half as the retail season in Mexico kicks in, looking at the cross border bids that have occurred, you will see those more in the first quarter of 2018. ","So, we are going to continue to see the ramp up here over the next six, nine months. But we are excited about both of those terminals and the servicing that we are seeking from them. So it\u2019s a good space right now in L\u00e1zaro. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","This is Pat. I just like to provide a little other kind of color commentary on the intermodal and the pricing in the peso. You got to remember and I think we\u2019ve talked about this on our previous earnings call. Our piece of the move is a relatively small portion of the cost of the total move, just take North China to Mexico City, we are charging hundreds of dollars. ","That move is thousands of dollars and for the most part, that business is US dollar based. So, our customer, the ocean carrier and the beneficial owner are paying in dollars and the savings that they can incur because of the weakness of the peso at today\u2019s level is literally in the tens of dollars. We offer a security advantage versus truck, a safety, security, cargo security. ","So, the magnitude of the savings if you will, that our customers can enjoy at today\u2019s currency levels versus the security aspect and just put an example to it, if you lose one container filled with flat screen TVs, you have eliminated interest savings on hundreds or maybe thousands of containers by going to cheaper truck. ","So it\u2019s important to kind of put this in perspective that for the ocean carrier and the beneficial owner, the savings that they can get from the currency at today\u2019s level, at 22 or 23, it\u2019s a little bit bigger, but at today\u2019s level it\u2019s insignificant versus the security features of rail. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. ","Scott Group ","Hey thanks. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Scott. ","Scott Group ","Morning guys. So, really strong yields in the quarter and it looks like mix was a big help. Is there any way to kind of help us, I know, mix is a tough one, but is there any way to kind of help us think about kind of the pace of either total yields growth or mix, given your volume outlook for the back half of the year? I am thinking about going forward. ","Jeffrey Songer","Yes, Scott, what I would tell you is, I think that, we are continuing to see growth in all of our major lines of business. And so when you think about yield and how the pricing and overall items that would drive both revenue per unit and earnings growth, we are seeing benefits in almost every single one of our business units. ","So, it\u2019s linked to haul. It\u2019s pricing. And it is volume. Some of these are really moving forward the energy segment obviously. So, across all the units, across all of the elements that you would expect to drive yield, we are seeing strength in each one of those. ","Scott Group ","So, meaning, it looks like mix was \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 400, 500 basis points help in the second quarter. Are you saying you think that\u2019s kind of a sustainable tailwind into the back half of the year given the volume outlook that you guys have?","Jeffrey Songer","Yes. ","Scott Group ","Okay.","Michael Upchurch","Scott, this is Mike. Obviously, we are not going to see core growth like we did in the second quarter, that\u2019s maybe stating the obvious, I think crude could come down a little bit in growth. It\u2019s always hard to project as from a mix perspective, but the utility coal and crude are about average RPU segments for us. ","I think where you could see some continued growth would be in the refined product area and petroleum because of the length of the hauls typically did better mix story for us. So, those are the couple of puts and takes. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I would also say that intermodal yields as a revenue and profitability per train will be a contributing factor even though people tend to think that intermodal is low yielding because of revenue per unit. But when you consider the capacity that we have particularly with the new service, every container that we add and as we complete, as we build out the density on those trains and that service, as we achieve greater balance north bound and south bound, the margin improvement on that service could be significant. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Good morning. I wanted to \u2013 so if you could expand on that a little bit further, Pat just in terms of where are you at with the bound to northern service on intermodal in terms of containers per train and how far along you are in a way that\u2019s built out and I don\u2019t know if you have thoughts on that more broadly across the intermodal business in terms of we add on train length and where do you think that can go to, because obviously that can be a nice contributor to incremental margin profitability?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I am going to take a first shot at it and Brian can add some color, but I\u2019d start by saying I am going to give you a fairly unsatisfying answer in terms of specifics, in terms of number of containers. I will say, we are ahead of where we expect it to be after just a few months. ","So it\u2019s growing faster. We and BN and the customers are very pleased with the service. And we are \u2013 I\u2019ll say, we are probably about 50%, maybe even less than 50% of where we could be if we ran an ideal density and balance type of network. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Okay, I am going to give you another one that you may provide an unsatisfying answer or maybe you\u2019ll get by the time. That was a fine answer. That was helpful. I appreciate that. ","Brian Hancock","We won\u2019t respond by saying, it may not be a very fast lying answer, but it\u2019s the answer we are going to give you. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Right, right. I understand. Refined products, you\u2019ve seen a pretty significant ramp in that and it would seem like there is a way to go. So if you have 5000 carloads to that in the second quarter, whatever the number was for second quarter for refined products to Mexico, is there a way to put - providing a ballpark for what can that be in third quarter, fourth quarter or if that\u2019s too near-term? ","What kind of a runrate can you achieve when you look at 2018 and some of this \u2013 more of these unit train terminals have come online and you got more time for people to ramp up. Just kind of a broader way of thinking about it.","Brian Hancock","Yes, this is Brian again. What I would tell you is, it\u2019s difficult to put a number on it obviously in the short-term. I have so many of the terminals that are under construction. Again, we will go through those stats, U.S. has a 90 day supply. Mexico has a 2.5 day supply. So, when you think about the mammoth stores that have to be built out, the lines that have to be really connecting those, those particular storage facilities, we got a long way to go. ","But we are going to continue to see growth and significant growth as these facilities come on not only in the second half, but into 2018. There are a number of players both on the origin and destination side that are under construction. And so, you are going to continue to see pretty significant growth in these refined products, especially LPGs and the unleaded fuel here in the next 12 months. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question. ","Chris Wetherbee ","Thanks. Good morning.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Hi, Chris. ","Chris Wetherbee ","Hey. I wanted to ask a little bit on the volume outlook for the second half of the year. So, just comparing that\u2019s where you were a quarter ago, it looks like, you are in the high 80s in terms of neutral or favorable sort of commodity groups versus, I guess about basically the entire business last time. So just wanted to get a sense of maybe how we think about this cadence going into the back half of the year? Clearly, there was very good growth in the first half. Just want to get a sense of maybe if you could help us with some of those end-markets and how we should be thinking about the growth?","Brian Hancock","Yes, I think, Chris, the perfect answer to that was, Mike, when he came in and said, we don\u2019t believe or going to continue to see the growth in the energy market that we saw in the first half. But we are very happy with the sequential growth and it\u2019s going to continue to stay strong as just when you look at the comps, that\u2019s going to be a little bit different. ","When you think about the Ag market again, it continues to grow at the same pace that we thought it would. All the other businesses that we thought would be favorable or going to continue to be favorable, but again this look on that page is very much second half focus and that\u2019s where that energy market is just kind of leveling out. ","We are starting to get into our groove if you will there from a volume perspective. And really the only negative that we have there is, the industrial consumer and that\u2019s just the continued focus on price in the paper and steel markets. So, we feel really good about all the markets we are in. ","Chris Wetherbee ","Okay, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then, when you think about refined products, I guess this is a two-part question, when I look at the slide that kind of highlights the quarter-to-date revenue in carloads. It looks like June maybe took a slight pause relative to May. ","So just wanted to get some color around that and then sort of in connection with the investment you are making down in Mexico and terminals, do you need to see more investment before that really starts to ramp up in the second half of this year maybe 2018? ","Brian Hancock","Yes, I think, I would say that, you are going to continue to see more investments. So there is going to be investment in tracks, terminals, Jeff talks about the facilities at Sanchez that are going to support some of this volume. So you are going to continue to see that. ","So, as those investments are made, you are going to continue to see volumes grow. What I say May, or June, it is lower or higher, in reality, we continue to see it moving higher each month. Whether there is a timing difference on when shipments move, and I mean, you know train volumes and they are relatively low right now. ","So, one train and the train and that could make a difference. But what we are seeing is continued growth across all of those segments that we are supporting into next year, certainly as we get to the end of 2017, we are going to continue to see that growth. ","Michael Upchurch","Chris, this is Mike. Obviously, three weeks in July doesn\u2019t make for a month or a quarter, but we\u2019ve seen a significant ramp in the month of July. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question. ","Justin Long ","Thanks, good morning and congrats on the quarter. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thank you. ","Michael Upchurch","Thanks, Justin. ","Justin Long ","So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about your capital deployment strategy as it relates to refined products in Mexico, now that this business has started to ramp pretty significantly. Have you thought more about the amount of capital you\u2019d be willing to allocate towards this opportunity and as you think about the returns, are you viewing this as a \u2013 something like a five year investment given the potential for pipelines longer-term or do you think, you can still generate a return over a \u2013 call it, five year timeframe?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Justin, what I would say is, we are continuing to look at a number of key investments. We think we are going to continue to see ourselves as well as others investing in terminals that are going to drive the volume necessary. ","When we look at the competition with pipelines and others, it\u2019s important to remember a pipeline is going to require the same type of real estate purchases and things that we have in the railroad environment and so, it takes a number of years. ","We think we are probably at least two to three years out in front of anybody else in this space and by developing these terminals that I mentioned, with the high density able to take both trans load and storage. We think we have a pretty significant advantage. So, we are going to start to see the returns immediately as soon as these terminals are open. ","Our terminal down in SOP is now open for business. And so, as we start moving products through those, we are going to see returns I think immediately and we are excited about the other opportunities we are looking at as well. So, it\u2019s a good place to be right now in this refined market. ","Justin Long ","Okay, great. And secondly, and this is probably one for Mike. I think you\u2019ve talked previously about incremental margins being in that 50% to 55% range on average as volumes grow. But, do you think about all the moving pieces in the business right now? And the favorable mix that you are seeing especially in refined products, is the near-term incremental margin profile likely to be better than that range?","Michael Upchurch","Again, our long stated goal has been to have incremental margins above 50% and every quarter things pop up in the quarter that could impact that positively or negatively. So I\u2019d make that statement over an annual period and we are happy with where our incremental margins are and our goal is obviously to continue to drive those up through the rest of the year. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason Seidl ","Thank you, operator. Good morning everybody.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Jason. ","Jason Seidl ","Couple quick ones here. I guess, one, I\u2019ll piggy back on another question. You guys mentioned the service with the BNSF is not anywhere near ideal density and\/or lane balances. When do you expect to get towards that ideal level and what\u2019s going to get you there?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, it\u2019s business.","Brian Hancock","Jason, I would tell you, we are right on and actually ahead of where we thought we would be. All of the partners that are engaged in this obviously it\u2019s a number of railroads, IMCs. Everybody is completely focused on this. We\u2019ve always said it will be the consistency of service that drive people towards this. ","The bid cycles of these are February and so, from our perspective, we are going to have a great second half in the intermodal business. We are going to do better in the bid cycles next year, because people are going to get used to it. ","They are going to trust the service and so, it\u2019s going to continue to grow. But it takes time. People have to depend on this service. It\u2019s important and I think Jeff and his team have done a great job of giving us that consistency. ","Jason Seidl ","Okay. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","We will let you have a follow-up question here, but, I hope nothing, we said earlier suggest that we are disappointed. I think the way you phrase the question, we are very pleased with this. It\u2019s ahead of schedule and we didn\u2019t expect it to fill up the train in just a few months. And I think, go back to Brian the math and the discussion that Brian showed in the presentation and I hope everyone understand the significance of where we are at strategically with our intermodal product. ","We literally can provide intermodal service to any connecting carrier, container solution, IMC, and major market in the country. So, as you know, some of the U.S. railroads and IMC companies are strategically linked. ","So, now we have options for anyone and everyone regardless of what IMC and what railroad and what market you want to go to, to connect Mexico. So, we should be very well positioned to see growth in market share in this business for many years to come. ","Jason Seidl ","Pat, the question was more of trying to understand when we should start seeing margin improvements as opposed to thinking you guys are disappointed. Turning to pricing, you said you are basically were about the same level as you were in 1Q in terms of same-store. But I noted in your commentary that you are starting to sign new deals at higher levels. What\u2019s sort of driving that ramp up in pricing power in your opinion?","Michael Upchurch","Yes, Jason, this is Mike. I said, renewals were a little bit higher, slightly higher and please understand, renewals, you are not renewing your entire book of business in one quarter and it was only about 10% of our book of business that renewed in the second quarter. So, I want to - maybe tamper your enthusiasm. ","We are obviously going to look for driving price based on the value that we are providing to our customer base. But we think the pricing environment is about the same that we\u2019ve seen over the last three or four quarters.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. ","Brandon Oglenski "," Hey, good morning everyone and thanks for taking my question. Sorry, did I got a little bit distracted as we gone through the Q&A. So if I am asking the duplicative question, I apologize you again. Maybe that won\u2019t be a great question for you. But, where do we see the margins long-term in this business guys? ","I mean, we\u2019ve been talking about getting to the low 60s and why you are there this year. Is there a lot of room for improvement on the efficiency side as you ramp up some of these investments you guys are making over the last several years? ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, I\u2019ll take that one and maybe let Jeff to comment. I mean, we still see opportunities for operational improvement obviously. Volume and the pricing environment we are in will be helpful and contribute to further margin improvement, but there is also \u2013 the harder work of continuing to improve and refine the way we run the railroad and I think, I am glad, we got the opportunity as Jeff to chime in here, because that\u2019s where we really saw significant improvements, particularly in some of the Northern Mexico, but really across the network during the quarter. Jeff, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment.","Jeffrey Songer","No, again we are continuing to focus on the main drivers equipment, asset utilization. I think we saw some nice improvement in cycle times here in Mexico which is heavily dependent on the car hire numbers. So I think we saw some nice benefit in the quarter for that. ","Locomotive, if we \u2013 you see we\u2019ve got the \u2013 we are at the same number of locomotives in storage that we had last quarter with about 5% sequential growth. So that suggests we are continuing to gain efficiencies there. Probably some opportunities we are going to start looking at our low \u2013 our switching. I think we\u2019ve got some additional room for consolidation and things like that. So we are continuing to focus on all the key drivers and I see there is still room to go. ","Brandon Oglenski ","Yes, and I am sorry, Pat and Jeff, they have might not been a very satisfying question. But if your western peers though who out there that say, hey look, we can get to a 55 and you know that there is a lot of discussion on what CFX is going to with Mr. Harrison. And is there any reason to believe that, a shorter length of haul business like yours can\u2019t get to those levels or should we be thinking long-term, it\u2019s all kind of the same? ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I\u2019ll put it this way. There is no reason and we certainly don\u2019t feel that we can\u2019t keep pace with the rest of the industry. Obviously, we don\u2019t have the length of haul. But we\u2019ve got other things that we have to use as levers to improve profitability. But I will also say, and you\u2019ve seen this and if you have watched our change in compensation philosophy. ","And in some of the metrics we are using as we get down to a 60 operating ratio, it becomes a little more important to look at sort of balanced set of metrics including cash flow and return on invested capital and an increase in earnings per share and we \u2013 not to suggest by any stretch that we have declared victory or we will declare victory on operating ratio. ","But it really becomes more of a question of what are the main drivers that shareholders are interested in and when you get to a certain operating ratio level, this will become more important to look at different metrics that will drive shareholder value. ","Michael Upchurch","Yes, this is Mike. I\u2019ll just make one additional comment. If you work your way through our numbers this quarter and just look at the revenue growth and the kind of bottom-line contribution that had, I\u2019ll take that revenue growth any quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question. ","Bascome Majors ","Yes, if you go back and look a few years ago, the KSU story, free cash flow wasn\u2019t super high on the list of readers to own the stock. But that has changed quite a bit and looks like it has a potential to continue to change very much in a positive direction over the next few years as your CapEx comes down and if we have economic growth to grow the business on top of that. ","I am just curious, as we kind of look at that trajectory of free cash flow versus earnings over the next, two, three, four years, were there any offsets we should think about before we get too carried away?","Michael Upchurch","Bascome, this is Mike. I would agree with all of your suggestions about where free cash flow will go. The only thing that will be a little bit different going forward and it\u2019s tough to anticipate right now exactly when that would happen would be cash taxes in the U.S. We are not currently a cash tax payer. We would expect to at some point in time. ","But with bonus depreciation, we are really in place for the next couple of years, we feel good about our ability not to be a cash tax payer and then if tax reform is enacted, we\u2019ll just have to see what the impacts are there. But, at least over the next couple of years, we would not anticipate any kind of significant step-up in the cash taxpaying status in the U.S. We are in Mexico. ","Bascome Majors ","Well, if, kind of drilling down on that a little bit, assuming that nothing happens on the tax reform front just federal law continuing as is, roughly when, based on your projections would that shift to taxpaying in the U.S. happen? And if you could give us a sense of kind of the delta that might have on your cash tax rate? ","Michael Upchurch","I\u2019ll say, as far out as we possibly can push it and no, I won\u2019t go through any of those details because I think there are too many variables that stake a couple of years out to give you any credible estimates on that. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","Hey, good morning. Thanks for getting me in here at the end.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","Just to, Brian for you and then maybe for Jose, just anymore details on the SOP terminal? You mentioned the $20 million of spending coming up, it\u2019s open for business, but clearly in the numbers it\u2019s not really generating too much volume yet. ","So, if you could just give us a sense of how that is ramping up and perhaps what sort of customer interest you are getting in? And which type of customers those might be if it\u2019s from people who are establishing their own brands, like the Exxons of the world or if you have some kind of internal domestic players in Mexico as well?","Brian Hancock","Sure, Brian. What I would tell you, is SOP is open for business in trans business, so that means directly from rail to truck. The storage part of that facility will be coming here in the near future and the important part of the customer base is obviously I can\u2019t give you the names of the people that are interested in that, but we have high interest from, I would tell you two main groups. ","The suppliers of refined products in the Mexico which are primarily those who have the refined products already in the U.S. and Gulf Coast and then the distributors who actually will receive the product from that facility. Without storage you kind of have to have a very specific relationship, rail to truck ratio. And that\u2019s really where we are working. ","But what I would tell you is we are open for trans business and expect to be open for storage business as quickly as things can happen down there that allows to get the storage built quickly. But that\u2019s usually about a nine month process to get a tank built. So, that gives you a little bit of a range. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","Okay, so probably by end of \u2013 year end would be a reasonable expectation?","Brian Hancock","Well, you\u2019ll see volumes into that facility for all of the second half and much higher volumes into 2018 as you have the storage available. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","Right, I was referring to this storage coming online. ","Brian Hancock","Yes, 2018, certainly. ","Brian Ossenbeck ","Okay. And then, just a follow-up one on PTC. The ramp up of the expenses are certainly helpful. I was wondering if you could put some context around \u2013 you said there is some headcount in the quarter Jeff, so, how much was that and how much more do you think is coming into the future and sort of your initial impressions of revenue service testing, six sub-divisions, I mean where do you have to go? What are you seeing anything, positive, negative, that\u2019s coming out of the early phase of that test? Thanks. ","Jeffrey Songer","So, this is Jeff. The actual financial impact might get \u2013 of course in corporate, those headcount assumptions. I think the number was around 20, 25 for the total, just absolute number of heads added. PTC, again I said we are on schedule as an industry to be installed on our own network in 2018 and they continue to work through 2020 in operability and things. ","So, as we roll into revenue service, again, I just highlighted that, we\u2019ve got a pretty aggressive rollout schedule, pretty aggressive timeframe which I think we are okay to achieve and are on target to achieve. But I kind of added that additional demand. I am pleased with what we\u2019ve done with locomotive fleet and again sequentially, we\u2019ve really held locomotives flat with the volume increase. ","It could be a little more pressure on a few more locomotives as we work out bucks to the revenue service testing. But nothing I would think significant either way at this point. As we really ramp up in the next quarter, we will have more of an indication on actual impacts. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Ken Hoexter ","Great. Thanks for the run on the energy side. Just a question on your just \u2013 guess, Sasol and Autos. Any change on the timing and maybe if you can talk about scale what we should anticipate on that as we move through 2017 and into 2018?","Brian Hancock","Ken, I think you cut out just a little bit. ","Ken Hoexter ","Yes. ","Brian Hancock","What was the question about auto?","Ken Hoexter ","Well, just I was starting on Sasol on the timing and scale of that. When we should anticipate that coming online and then the auto was just \u2013 any change to the plans that are coming on, I guess, BMW is next up and then Mercedes Infiniti. There has been no change to those schedules right? ","Michael Upchurch","No change at all. Obviously, Sasol will be completed just said by the end of the year with our portion. We will begin to use that yard. Sasol comes on probably July 2018 is their plan that they have announced and so, no changes on that front. ","Automotive, all of the plans are proceeding forward. We are right in the middle of a couple of bids for the new facilities. So we feel comfortable with where we are at from a timing perspective, but no, everything is still onboard as we\u2019re on the path. ","Ken Hoexter ","And Pat, I know you said, not to waste the valuable question on the whitepaper, but since nobody is at, any \u2013 maybe you can talk about the timing, not the process, obviously, the process you highlighted in the document, but anything on the timing. Has any of that changed? Or can you walk us through what we should expect in terms of the timing for that?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I think the timing that we still expect the final revolution to be sometime in December. But that\u2019s really all we know. We\u2019ve changed, again, I\u2019ll draw your attention to Page 15 of our 10-Q which will be outlier today with a pretty good disclosure on what has happened there. It\u2019s not earth shattering, we are just waiting for the final conclusion. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Please proceed with your question. ","Jeffrey Kauffman ","Thank you very much. Just a quick question for Mike. Mike, given the changes we\u2019ve seen in currency as of late at the forward forecast that you have listed in your presentation. Does this change your view at all for tax rate in the second half of the year? Or how we should think about it heading into 2018?","Michael Upchurch","It would not change our view around the adjusted tax rate that we referred. Obviously, if you look at the appendix in Slide 27, you can see the reported effective tax rate is quite a bit higher, because of the improvement in the peso. But the adjusted is fairly consistent on a year-over-year basis. We were 34.6 in the second quarter of this year and 33.7 a year ago. So I would continue to guide you about 34%. ","Jeffrey Kauffman ","Okay. My other questions have been answered. Thanks guys. ","Michael Upchurch","All right. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. ","Tyler Brown ","Hey, good morning. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Tyler. ","Tyler Brown ","Hey, Pat. This is a bit of a less field question, but I\u2019d like to ask maybe about a Dave \u2013 in favor with the PCRC. So, there is clearly been some short line properties here in the U.S. with very solid port \u2013 stories that have sold at high multiples. It looks like the PCRC maybe contributes 2% to pretax income. I mean, would you and your partner ever look to shop that property? Or do you consider it strategic?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","There has been no discussions about shopping that property. It runs very well. It requires, Tom Cana who is the President, does a terrific job. He requires very little supervision and effort on the part of us and our partner. So we are happy with it. It\u2019s a great business model and we\u2019ve had no discussions about shopping it. ","As your second question, other than the fact that we do have some common customers, it obviously doesn\u2019t connect to our \u2013 or the rest of our network. So, I would not say that it\u2019s terribly strategic. That it\u2019s a nice performing asset that requires very little intervention and effort from Kansas City. ","Tyler Brown ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then Mike, from a balance sheet perspective, you guys call it, have \u2013 call it, sub-two times debt-to-EBITDA. It seems like the agencies are unwilling to reward you for the ratios and you\u2019ve got a number of heavy capital projects that are going to sunset. So would it ever make sense to maybe lever up a bit, take advantage in the stock? Is that something you and the Board have kind of discussed?","Michael Upchurch","Well, we are having ongoing discussions with the agencies, but I am sure you can appreciate that\u2019s like a snail moving through peanut butter. We are having discussions with our Board coming up. But we are not in a position right now to indicate when we are or how we would handle that. ","Operator","Thank you. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","So we see no further questions in the queue and there is no better way to end this call than the visualization of a snail moving through peanut butter. So, thank you for your attention. Again, we feel great about the quarter, solid and clean. ","I think that describes how we feel about it, momentum, particularly in some of the new business areas like refined products, the new intermodal service, the plastics, the APM terminal, Lazaro, all sort of coming together the way we had hoped and envisioned. And some of the storm clouds that have darkened our horizon seem to be going away. ","So, thank you for your attention and we will do this again in about 90 days. All right, bye, bye. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.

Joining me this morning for Kansas City Southern\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings call are, EVP and Chief Operating Officer, Dave Ebbrecht; EVP, Sales and Marketing, Pat Ottensmeyer; EVP and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Upchurch and Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, KCSM President and Executive Representative is participating by telephone and will be available for questions later on.","KCS\u2019 overview; I am very pleased to be able to kick off this call by saying that KCS\u2019 third quarter furloughs and revenues were both quarterly records for our company. We were able to establish this despite somewhat anemic US economic growth and the fallout from one of the worst drought ravaged grain harvest in US history; speaks volumes about the overall strength of our business mix.","In 2012, we\u2019ve been spending considerable time talking to investors and analysts about five areas of growth that would appear to have exceptional upside. For the first half of 2012, cross-border intermodal, automotive, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas container traffic, frac sand and crude oil represented 15% of total KCS freight revenues and were growing at a rate of 35%.","In the third quarter this pace increased; during the quarter, those five areas represented 18% of freight revenues and grew at a rate of 46%. While this growth is in itself impressive, what is even more important from the long-term is that we're early in the development of each of these areas. There is a very long runway ahead for intermodal, automotive and energy franchises.","Speaking of growth, KCSM volumes grew 12% in the quarter. You heard us say this before, but it bears repeating. The nearest-sourcing phenomenon in Mexico is real and the momentum seems to gain spinning every quarter. Not only the major automotive, electronics and appliance manufacturers building facilities in Mexico, they are bringing their suppliers with them. To give you an example, over 20 Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 auto suppliers are following Asian auto-manufacturers to Mexico. We are seeing a similar phenomenon in other industries with the large main brand manufacturers are bringing their part suppliers with them as they locate in Mexico.","KCS\u2019 business growth is reflective of three key components. First, Mexico\u2019s GDP is growing 3.7% despite the sluggish performance of the US. economy. While Mexico\u2019s growth is still and always will be linked to the US, its economy is growing on its own merits and near-sourcing will only solidify its strength.","The second key component driving KCSM is that KCS operates the only single line rail service between the US and Mexico and trade between the two countries continues to expand at record levels. As rail is the most efficient mode for moving most of the commodity flowing between the two countries or three countries if you count Canada, KCSM and KCS will continue to benefit from the trade growth. The crossing at Laredo, Texas is the primary surface transportation freight gateway between US and Mexico.","The third component driving KCSM growth is its excellent rail service. KCSM operates an efficient and secure system with good on-time performance. In short, it can stand alongside any of the North American Class I railroads in terms of service. We have invested heavily in building up our Mexican infrastructure and our customers are reacting by providing us with more business.","My final comment in the overview chart is on our solid revenues, cost controls and operating performance resulted in a third quarter operating ratio of 68.7%. On a pure-performance basis this is the best quarterly operating ratio in the company\u2019s history and represents a 2.6 point improvement over the 2011 third quarter adjusted number.","Once again, accomplishing this without the benefit of some of our long-haul grain movements due to the drought and the dampening effect of the economy impact on certain commodities is a testament to the diversity of our overall commodity mix and to the efficiency of our operations.","Turn to the guidance page. Before turning over to my colleagues, I\u2019ll briefly review our scorecard relative to our 2012 guidance. During our second quarter earnings call, we pulled down our revenue guidance a bit for the year due to the headwinds caused by diminished coal volumes. But essentially our revised guidance was for mid-single digit volume and revenue growth as well as mid-single digit pricing.","As you can see, we remain on target with year-to-date growth at 6%, revenue growth at 7% and pricing still solidly in the mid-single digit range. For the first nine months of 2012, we have improved our operating ratio by 2.1 points over 2011 adjusted number which puts us on-track for another excellent year-over-year improvement.","With that, I will turn the presentation over to Dave Ebbrecht for an operations update.","Dave Ebbrecht","Hey thanks Dave. Turning to slide nine, I would like to continue to reemphasize our consistent ability to control costs. As you can see, Ops cost which is the bottom red line on the chart has remained largely flat over the past four years as we have experienced a significant increase in the Line-Haul revenue.","As an operating team we continue to focus on absorbing growth within our network. We still have latent capacity on trains and the headcount to surge as necessary with the seasonality of the traffic. Our judicious expense management and cost control in these areas continues to be the major driver of overall improvement.","On slide 10, you can see our headcount controls are improving with growth. We still expect our efficiency to trend up throughout the year as our headcount will remain relatively flat; but we will see occasional dips as we initiate new service and expand our network.","On slide 11, you can see our operating metrics to continue to remain in a very good range for the third quarter. Velocity continues to be strong, averaging above 27 miles per hour and in the range necessary to maintain connection standards.","Dwell and Car Efficiency showed a very good trend of fluidity with the increased record volumes handled. The uptick in maintenance away Slow Order Miles is due to the heavy maintenance away activity that we had on the Shreveport and [Zacha Junction] subdivisions and the heat orders where the rail was above average new control temperature at the end of the summer. But the bigger point is that the slower track speeds has had no material impact on the velocity and the dwell. Our main message from operations continues to be that costs will scale below the volume and revenue growth projections.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Pat for Sales and Marketing.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Thanks Dave and good morning, everyone. I am going to start my comments on slide 13 where we show our normal summary of third quarter results by business units. As you heard earlier, we had record quarterly revenue of $577.4 million and record carloads of 552,000. We had record revenues in four of our six business units.","You can also see that RPU was flat or higher in all of our business units. Foreign exchange cost is about 6% in RPU in the automotive business for the quarter and about 1% in total revenue growth overall. You will also know that we are not showing consolidated RPU on slide this quarter. You can all do the math given the revenue and carload information, but the reason we are not highlighting consolidated RPU is because we thought it was causing some confusion that our yields were declining due to shift in mix and the very high growth in our intermodal shipments, which is absolutely not the case.","I\u2019ll come back to that comments at the end of this slide. But first, I\u2019ll make a few comments on some of the business units. The chemical and petroleum business generated record revenue for the quarter, in spite of a 3% decline in volume. Lower volumes were due to some softness in our plastics business in the US, which was really due to extremely strong third quarter of last year. ","RPU [industries] was very strong, which drove the overall increase in revenue. We also saw some weakness in our soda ash business, which is primarily a timing issue driven by vessel loading schedules at our Port Arthur export terminal. The investor and consumer business in total was basically flat last year, carloads for metal and pulp paper were both down slightly, our US metals carload were down due to general slowdown in the market. However our metals and scrap volumes in Mexico were actually up about 4%, revenues in that business in Mexico were up 11% and that was driven primarily by strength in auto production in Mexico. ","On the positive side, we are seeing a pick up, albeit in a small base in our lumbar and plywood and other construction related commodities as the housing market is finally showing some signs of life. Agricultural and minerals revenues and carloads were lower pretty much across the board. Our crop order grain business was impacted by high corn prices in the United States, resulting from the drought conditions that Dave talked about earlier. The high prices are driving cross border grain shipments down as Mexico is purchasing more towards local harvest and imports from other region, primarily South America. ","I'll spend more time talking about our grain franchise in a few minutes, which is very healthy on a long term basis. Food products revenues and volumes were lower due to the lost corn syrup business that we had talked about previously, and our ores and minerals businesses is lower due to the reduced rock shipments in the Haynesville Shale region, as new drilling activity in that area was down.","For the second consecutive quarter, our intermodal business set new records in revenue, carloads and RPU. Increased cross-border business continues to drive high revenue in volumes and strong RPU performance in that group. I will touch more on that in a couple of minutes. Automotive also broke record across the board in spite of foreign exchange drag on revenue and rate per unit. If the peso had remained flat year-over-year, RPU would have been 6% higher and revenue would have been 39% in the automotive business. The cross border growth is the fastest growing portion of this business unit, with high double-digit revenue and volume growth during the quarter.","Now let me go back to my earlier comments about RPU and yield. As I said earlier, RPU was flat or higher in each business units but down slightly overall. The reason for that is primarily the intermodal volume growth, which as you all know, is a lower RPU business, is much higher than the other businesses. That does not mean that our yields or contribution are falling or being diluted. Let me walk you through a quick comparison of a cross-border grain train and a cross border intermodal train.","The grain shovel train will have 100 cars and will be loaded only one-way. Our shovel trains are 100% empty return. The intermodal train could have 200 to 250 units, and their perfect world would be well balanced with loads in both directions. So even though the intermodal RPU is much lower than grain, the revenue per train could be much higher for the intermodal train on any given route. The cost is essentially the same; so as we fill out our capacity and balance our network, the yield and contribution on the intermodal business will be very attractive. In fact, it can even be higher than for higher ARPU businesses like train and coal.","The next slide shows the major contributor to revenue growth. In spite of lower volumes in the three of our six business units, the strong performance in intermodal and automotive drove pretty healthy volume related revenue increases. Fuel was a slight pickup, as we saw higher fuel surcharge revenue in Mexico. (inaudible) mix, other was driven primarily by a combination of higher frac sand and crude oil movement, increased length of haul primarily due to growth in cross-border traffic and improved pricing. We\u2019re still seeing pricing in the mid-single digit area. Foreign exchange continues to be a drag in the quarter, and as I mentioned earlier cost us about 1% in total revenue growth.","On slide 15 we show the pieces of our energy business unit. At the end of the second quarter, we told you that utility coal volumes had bottomed in the spring and had recovered to what we saw were sustainable levels in June and July. So far that has proven to be the case. And even though whole revenue was slightly lower than last year, it grew by more than 40% over the second quarter. There are a couple of wild cards out there that could cause November and December comps to be more challenging, including the fact that we began shipping to a new customer in November of 2011.","During the third quarter, strong growth and record revenues in crude oil, frac sand more than offsets the declines in utility coal and pet coke. If you look at this chart on a year-to-date basis, the decline in utility coal is almost completely offset by growth in frac sand and crude oil. We saw a triple digit growth in crude oil revenue year-over-year and then near doubling over the last quarter and that growth could continue for the foreseeable future.","Slide 16 details the volume and revenue growth in our frac sand business, which is quite impressive. We currently have 12 frac sand destinations either on KCS or one of our short line partners, and we continue to see a lot of activity in the Eagle Ford and Permian regions, but we also expect to see growth in this business at high levels for the foreseeable future.","The next slide shows our cross-border revenue which was flat for the second quarter, but 8% higher than the prior year. What is noteworthy about this is that we are still showing year-over-year growth, in spite of sizeable reductions in our cross border Ag and minerals business, which today is our largest cross border commodity. Due to the drought conditions that Dave mentioned earlier and the losses from corn syrup business, our cross border Ag and minerals revenue in the third quarter was 35% below the record levels we saw in the second quarter, which explains the noticeable downward trend you see over the last three quarters on this chart.","Excluding Ag and minerals in our year-over-year comparisons, cross-border revenue in all other business units was up 15% from last year. Industrial and consumer was strong during the quarter, driven by metals and paper and intermodal and automotive growth continues at very high level. As you can see on the next slide on cross-border intermodal revenue continues to set new records in the third quarter, with volumes increasing by almost 100%, revenues by 88% versus last year. ","Intermodal growth accounted for over 55% of our year-over-year cross-border revenue growth. Based on our previous estimates that are addressable cross-border truck market is about 2.5 to 3 million units. You can see that we are still around only 2% market share on an annualized basis.","Moving on to slide 19 you will see the (inaudible) growth story remained strong as well, with revenue growth of 23% falling the 14, RPU of 9% which is a little bit higher than our overall intermodal results. Coupled with other comments about L\u00e1zaro and the outlook for the future; in August of this year, APM terminals finalized their concession agreement with the Mexican government to begin construction of a new container terminal at last L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Over the next several years, APM will invest about $900 million to develop this terminal with capacity estimated to be about 3 million TEUs.","Phase 1 construction began last months and is expected to be complete in early 2015. The next slide shows you our market outlook for the full year of 2012. As Dave, mentioned earlier, we are still expecting mid-single digit revenue growth for the full year, with volumes also in the mid-single digit range.","If you look at this slide and compared it to what we showed you last quarter, there is only one change and that is in Ag and minerals, which has been change from a single digit positive to a single digit negative. Last quarter I said that we still felt, we would finish ahead of last year, and I quote weather could be a factor and it sure was.","Conditions just kept getting worst through the summer, and we ended up with the corn crop, which is our major commodity at the lowest production since 2006 and the lowest yields since 1995. It\u2019s going to take a season to grow another crop, so this will have an affect on our business for the next few quarters.","We are not expecting on our Ag and minerals revenue to really rebound and show growth until the second half of next year. I will talk more about the longer term outlook for this business in a couple of slides. Other then that our guidance was exactly the same that was in the second quarter, of course we are closely monitoring the health of the economy and we will watch products like steel and paper very closely as we finish the year. ","Our guidance for energy continues to be negative for the full year in spite of really exceptional growth in frac sand and crude oil, but still we are not off the weaknesses in the utility coal this year. I want to emphasize this year because I do believe that long term the new energy markets will offset any risk we have in our utility coal business. The next slide is the one that we have included to highlight the five strategic growth areas that Dave mentioned earlier. These targeted growth markets grew by 46% during the quarter and 39% year-to-date, and today these businesses represent about 18% of our total revenue. ","As you can see crude oil is the fastest growing but with smaller base. We see it run with new opportunities in the business driven by our strategic position in the US Gulf Coast. As discussed earlier, both intermodal across the border and frac sands has grown at very high-double digit rates; L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas continues to reflect significant and steady growth. L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas was once again the fastest growing container port in the US in Mexico last year. And at 23% year-to-date growth in our automotive business, it is the second fastest growing business unit. ","You\u2019ll remember that in the second quarter presentation I gave you an update on the status of our automotive growth based on new plans that have been announced or under construction in Mexico, and we are looking at very strong growth in this business unit in the years ahead. ","Moving to slide 22, I want to spend a couple of minutes talking about our grain business which represents about 50% of our total Ag and mineral business unit and more than 20% of our cross border revenue. The punch line of this story is that in any given period our grain business will be affected by weather, crop conditions and other factors. However, KCS has a very attractive and strategically well positioned grain franchise. As you can see from this map, the KCS cross-border franchise is a highly efficient pipeline to move grains from the largest, most productive growing region in the world which is just north of Kansas City to some of the largest importing regions in the world which are in Mexico.","Mexico is the second largest importer of corn in the world behind Japan. In fact, in August our top grain customer recorded the largest export sale of grain by the United States in the last 23 years and the fourth largest ever. That product will move over the course of 2013 and we are handling some of that business today, so this is not all incremental.","Moving to slide 23, you can see that our franchise is going to get stronger on the origination end with two new grain elevators and several loading facilities coming under KCS network next year. Combined these two facilities will give us access to two new producing regions and will have storage capacity of 3.5 million to 4 million bushels. We will see this business moving out of these facilities in the second half of next year and it will only strengthen our well positioned grain franchise.","Moving on to slide 24, I will just cover these points quickly. There is no change in our outlook for the economy or for the pricing environment. I think its really remarkable to produce the revenue and volume results that we just announced in the quarter were coal and grain which represents 20% of our business, were both weak. I am sure we will get our fair share of coal questions, so I will just say that our visibility into the future is at best cloudy. We will give our 2013 nominations from our customers around December 1st so we should have a better feel for the outlook in a few weeks.","As I said at the end of the second quarter, our Utility Coal business bottomed in the spring and at this moment, we expect fourth quarter to be better than that, but the comps will be tougher because of new business that we took on in November of 2011.","Long-term, we are still very excited about the new business pipeline and growth prospects for KCS. As I mentioned earlier, our five strategic growth areas now represent almost 20% of our revenue and they\u2019re growing at about 40% annual rate. Automotive production in Mexico is estimated to grow by about 35% over the next four years and our auto-related business is about 16% to 18% of our total revenues.","Finally, I would like to close with one of the fun facts about our recent trends moving to slide 25. In spite of the third quarter volume decline in three of our business units, we produced three consecutive monthly records for total revenue in July, August and September and based on the average daily carload through October 17th, we could easily see another record this month. It really validates the strength and diverse nature of our franchise.","Now I will turn it over to Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks Pat and good morning everyone. I would like to start with my comments on slide 27. And while you see reported operating income did decline slightly, when you look at adjusted operating income excluding the $25.6 million insurance recovery gain that we recorded in the third quarter of 2011, operating income actually increased 16% to $181 million.","Operating expenses continue to scale very well and increased only 2% on volume increase of 7% and revenue increase of 6%. And as we\u2019ve already indicated, our operating ratio of 68.7 represent the best ever normalized OR for KCS.","Interest expense in the quarter declined 25% to $24.1 million, the result of refinancing activity completed during the first half of this year and the retirement of the 13% notes from December 2011. And we now expect to report interest expense of about $100 million for fiscal year 2012, which represents $74 million reduction from our peak interest expense in 2009.","Due to the strengthening Peso our FX gain was $3.7 million during the quarter, but that was more than offset by an increasing tax rate from the improving exchange rate. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 44.9% and is 38.4% for the first nine months of 2012. I\u2019ll cover the tax rate in more detail on the few slides. And finally, diluted earnings per share of $0.82, is 5% higher than the adjusted EPS from the third quarter of 2011.","Turning to page 28, I would like to provide a little bit more insight into our reported EPS. Quite unfavorable fuel comparisons year-over-year; our adjusted operating income increase contributed to the majority of the increase in EPS by driving earnings higher by $0.16 per share. Additionally, interest expense savings contributed another $0.05 per share to the bottomline. And then the net impact of the foreign exchange gain and the impact of the higher tax rate combined reduced EPS by $0.15. So you can see it was a particularly challenging quarter from a foreign exchange perspective and I\u2019ll discuss the tax impact on the next page.","Shifting to the tax rate on page 29; as a result of the improving exchange rate noted in the table on the right, our estimate for the full year 2012, our effective tax rate has increased from the 36 to 38% range we provided at the end of the second quarter to 39%. As you might recall, Mexican tax law requires us to revalue our U.S. denominated debt when the currency rate changes. You might think (inaudible) the FX mark to market revaluation.","Specifically, the projected 12\/31\/2012 forward rate improved from 13.5% at the end of the second quarter to 13% at the end of the third quarter which creates taxable income as that now theoretically requires fewer pesos to extinguish our US dollar denominated debt. This does represented a non-cash expense for us; aren\u2019t currently a cash tax payer in Mexico and we have been utilizing NOLs to offset any cash tax obligation. Once we do transition to becoming a cash tax payer, we could pursue several strategies to hedge our economic cash risk and we will be evaluating that going forward.","As you can see in the waterfall charts, we have reconciled the statutory rate and the top chart reconciles the third quarter rate from 35% to 44.9%. Now I\u2019ll comment on a couple of these reconciling items, first the bar labeled foreign exchange at 5.7% represents the period impact of the strengthening peso. The bar representing in the first half true-up at 5% and you might recall GAAP requires us to go back to periods and true-up our tax rate, so we already represents the impact of having the increase the tax rate from the first half of the year estimated 36.5% to the new full year estimated 39%. And then finally, the lower foreign tax rate of 3.2% that you see, essentially represents the lower federal income tax rate in Mexico versus the US when applied in each countries\u2019 pre-tax income levels.","Turning to page 30 you can see the changes in the components of our operating expenses. And we continue to scale extremely well during the quarter by managing expenses to a 2% increase, while volumes increased 7% and revenue increased 6%. In the table on the right, you can see our estimated volume growth and expenses increased $10 million, higher diesel prices in Mexico increased fuel expense by $3 million while FX reduced our expenses by 7%.","Our volume related expenses are primarily comprised of fuel consumption, variable compensation, equipment cost and intermodal charges. And it is important to note, that FX impacted operating income by less than $1 million during the quarter; as the benefit we saw in expenses was offset by $6 million decline in revenue that Pat addressed earlier.","I\u2019ll turn now to compensation and fuel expenses on the next two slides. The purchased services increased $4 million largely due to reduced package right fees collected in Mexico. Equipment costs were flat year-over-year, with lower locomotive expenses from the lease buyout in the third quarter of 2011, offset with higher volumes. Depreciation expense continues to increase due to our higher asset base and materials and others was flat with higher concession fee payments of $2 million being offset by lower casualty cost.","On slide 31, compensation and benefits expense continues to be a great story for KCS; it decreased $1 million to $108 million for the quarter; volume related expenses increased $2 million while headcount actually declined slightly. And as Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to scale headcount very, very effectively in our operations group. Finally, foreign exchange contributed to $2 million reduction in comps and benefits.","On slide 32, our fuel expense increased $3 million during the quarter. Price and volume both contributed about $3 million to the higher fuel expense and those increases were partially offset by $0.10 per gallon FX benefits that reduced overall fuel expense by $3 million. We do estimate our negative lag impact during the quarter was about $4 million as a result of higher fuel prices that would be recovered in future periods through our fuel surcharge and that compares to a $2 million favorable lag benefit we had in the third quarter of 2011, so the year-over-year comps were certainly not favorable.","Finally on slide 33, we generated $145 million of free cash flow through the first nine months of 2012 despite initiating and paying dividend this year. We did receive our first investment grade rating from Fitch during the quarter and despite having achieved investment grade credit metrics, macro economic conditions in fiscal cliff two issues we can't control continue to be an impediment to getting another investment grade rating which would allow us to refinance the balance sheet. However, we are optimistic that in the near-term we can get at least one of the remaining agencies to upgrade us and that would allow us to access longer-term maturities at historically low rates. So the 12.5% KCSM notes which does represent our highest coupon debt are callable on April 1, 2013 and our current plans would be to either retire those with cash or potentially refinance the notes at that point.","While our top priority with excess cash continues to be the best in the business to support the exceptional growth opportunities we have; accordingly, we have invested 18% of our revenue in core capital projects and on top of that accelerated the purchase of new locomotives in to 2012 to take advantage of the bonus depreciation benefit which does represent an incremental 3% of revenue. ","Finally, we continue to explore our lease purchase options to convert our leased assets in to owned asset and have committed $23 million year-to-date to those efforts primarily purchasing equipment under lease. Lastly, we declared our third quarter dividend on August 7, payable on October 3, which totaled 21.5 million and that dividend currently yield approximately 1%. ","With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Dave Starling.","David Starling","I'll conclude by saying that the third quarter results again underline the fact that the KCS growth story is still very much intact. Furthermore, we believe that the commodities that drove growth in the past quarter we continue to play prominent roles for many years in to the future. And one final point I would like to add is, not only is KCS hitting the majority of the sales and operations target, but are ever strengthening corporate structure and balance sheet moving us closer to obtaining investment grade status. ","As Mike Upchurch just explained, this provided an investment grade ratings to KCS; another clear indication that we are moving along the right path to achieving the most important goal we\u2019ve set for our company.","And with that, the team is happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Maybe you could guys pick up on where you left off Dave and maybe for Mike, just when you think about the potential for getting upgraded to investment grade. Can you give us some of a sense of maybe, what the opportunity would be for you thus far, refinancing some of the material that you have out there? I mean what really is possible as far as getting the (inaudible) or maybe it could be incremental savings from that?","Mike Upchurch","Yeah, Chris a great question; obviously in today\u2019s environment with historical rates, the opportunity we think is pretty substantial. If we are investment grade today, we could probably refinance some of the stat at 3.5% on a 10-year note. We clearly, we have substantial cash balance where we could chose to go ahead and retire with cash, the 12.5% notes, I mean that issue alone would be $12.5 million of interest savings, given that we have $100 million outstanding.","And then really, if you look at our issues down in Mexico, most of those could be refinanced, the average rate there outside of the 12.5% is a little over 6% and reducing that potentially 3.5%. The only thing that could present a little bit higher interest expense and offset some of those savings would be if we push maturities out to 30 years where there is still an overall savings but probably coupons closer to 5% on a 30 year note. So depending on the strategy it could be a bit challenging to give you a point estimate there, but I think it\u2019s pretty material off of $100 million 2012 exit rate that we have.","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","And may be the follow-up just on the operational side for Dave Ebbrecht I guess, when you think about the headcount leverage that you still have in Mexico in particular, how should we think about that. I know you kind of have given us some guidance for keeping headcount flat, you\u2019ve done a very good job with that, but as you see this continued growth and particularly in 2013 do you feel that you are reaching a point whether it is a step function to move up or you are still able to get some pretty good leverage out of that?","Dave Ebbrecht","We are still able to get good leverage. We are hiring, but most of our hiring has been for attrition purposes and we won\u2019t hire in the areas where we have growth. But overall, when you look at the total network, we are able to scale relatively flat as we still have a lot of latent capacity within our trains and within our corridors. So I see us maintaining the same leverage through the next year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Hey Pat, can we ask you a little bit about to expand on the coal side of the business. There has been some discussion about the potential for to have some plant closures on your lines. I realize some of the stuff may not be finalized so we may not know, but any color you could offer there in terms of, how to think about guide post for \u201913?","Pat Ottensmeyer","That's a really great question, I wish, I knew the answer to it. It\u2019s been all over the math, when we talked to our customers, the range of forecast that we have gotten this year, as I mentioned, we don't yet have our nominations for next year is really very broad. So it\u2019s been difficult for us to forecast with any degree of accuracy. We only have nine plants on our network and we ought to be able to do a better job of forecasting that there are just so many factors that has changed the landscape.","You know Texas is going to be power, I don't think Texas can really operate with plant closures on a long term basis, but in any given quarter with natural gas prices being where they are, we could see shutdowns like we did in the spring of this year, where we saw a significant shutdowns of capacity. So it\u2019s just a real hard thing for us to get visibility on. As I said our crystal ball is very cloudy, there are couple of big events that are going to happen here in the next few weeks that will hopefully give us better clarity, including our customers giving us the nominations in 2013 around December 1st. ","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","If we look at 2013 then and we think about the broader portfolio, can you give any sense for what percentage of your business is locked in already, so you have a view on pricing and you\u2019ve had a very good pricing arguably among the best in the industry, can that continue or do you sort of converge toward the norm?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I think it can continue. Remember, half of our business is in Mexico, and if you just think about pricing being a function of inflation and CPI inflation in Mexico has consistently been a point or so higher than in the US. So that's one of the reasons that we have a little bit better pricing than the rest of the rails. A lot of our business in Mexico prices on an annual basis, so we have less locked-in than you are hearing from the other Class Is, probably 50% locked-in next year versus I think the others have reported higher numbers, but again it\u2019s inflation in Mexico. The other factor and Dave Starling touched on this is, we've really got a superior product, service, security other things in Mexico and that has allowed us to be a little higher in terms of the value that we\u2019re offering and coming through in rate negotiations on contract renewals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan","I wanted to ask Dave Starling, I think you made some comments, I believe it was the second quarter call where you said well, you know 2012 is kind of a slower growth year relative to the broad trend and then given some of the projects and market initiatives and so forth you might be a step up in the growth pace in 2013 and 2014. I want to ask if you still think that's the case and as you look to 2013 where the, what are the markets, the areas where you would expect to see a significant step up.","David Starling","Well Tom, I think in the context of the 2012 comment, I think we referred to it as a bridge year. It really wasn't going to be a slower year, but with the five auto plans coming on in the next two to three years, we think we will see the volume grow in 2013. It should accelerate even more in 2014, and then with all five plants fully operational, we should hit some kind of peak around 2015. ","In the meantime, you are going to see the intermodal growth continue. You are going to see L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas continue and possibly accelerate even beyond where it is when the APM facility opens in 2014 or 2015. You are still going to see crude and frac sand growth. So we don't see a downturn at anytime that you may see we could very easily slip back in to double-digit in the out years. Any question?","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan","Yeah, it does. Yeah I recall you said bridge there, not necessarily (inaudible), but when we think about auto, is there a timing, where the impact of the timing coming on would be more material, is that kind of second half of 2013, where you might see that step up? And then I guess in terms of drilling down on the crude oil, that\u2019s accelerated, but how do you think about, I guess the factors that would cause a step out here, there are some refinery investments in receiving facilities or are there factors and kind of timing of when they would give you potentially a step up in 2013 in crude oil?","David Starling","Well, I\u2019ll let Pat talk to you about the automotive side, but I think one thing we don\u2019t want to lose sight of is we're still the largest supplier of grain for Mexico and we've just come out of a drought year. So we certainly expect the back half of 2013 to be a very good year for grain and given the contract, the deal that was done with one of our customers with a major user in Mexico, we don\u2019t expect the first half of the year to be that weak. They\u2019ve got orders to fill down there and they\u2019re going to fill those orders; in fact they bought out in the futures to secure this corn. So they\u2019ve got a contract. They\u2019ve got to fulfill for the full-year 2013, so we're certainly going to help them do that. But the grain has been a significant hit for this year. It's something that we generally are, good margins, gives us a nice long haul. So we should have that grain back next year and with the two new elevators, we should have even growth in grain more than we have ever had in the past.","Pat Ottensmeyer","On the auto and crude oil Tom, the auto plants that are under construction Mazda, Honda and Nissan, those will begin producing finished vehicles in the first quarter of 2014. So we won\u2019t see much from those plants, but if you look at, we keep saying that this is a bridge here for automotive and adjusting for currency we\u2019re up 30% plus. So we like that bridge, we\u2019ll take that bridge; we\u2019re leading market share and so, we\u2019ll see the big pop from the new plants beginning in 2014.","Crude oil is just really hard for us to predict, I mean we\u2019re liberally getting, our team is working hard, they\u2019re doing a great job, but we\u2019re getting new requests, we\u2019re getting new movements and new business literally coming in almost every week. We\u2019re looking at a number of options to invest and use our footprint in Port Arthur, Texas to maximize our opportunities in that business; we are very well positioned at the receiving end, obviously like our coal business, we don\u2019t originate any crude oil, the thing that gives us the seat at the table is our footprint and our position in Port Arthur which is one of the biggest refining markets in the world.","So we\u2019re looking at making some investments; I don\u2019t think there is anything huge or there is no real kind of step function; capital that has to take place, it\u2019s just a big market, it imports a lot of crude oil and it wants to draw crude oil from Canada and from Bakken. And we through our rail connections we can deliver both. And it\u2019s probably not a satisfying answer, but it\u2019s just very hard for us to forecast the future there, because literally we\u2019re getting new business almost every week.","David Starling","I want to leave you with 2012, with the statement I made is that, we were not excited about 2012, we were going to be more excited about 2013; we\u2019re extremely excited about 2012; we think it\u2019s been a great year and at a time when we have had grain drought, drought affecting our grain and also the coal being down. We are very pleased with the growth of those other five major commodities; we don\u2019t see that slowing down, we see grain coming back.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Dahlman Rose. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose","First let me once again congratulate Chairman Haverty on winning the Salzburg Award yesterday. Pat, when you look at the coal business, if we exclude the potential closures of plants which may or may not happen and that\u2019s a little cloudy now, how could rest of the business look with natural gas having move up forward recently?","Pat Ottensmeyer","","It looks a whole lot better than it did 90 days ago, so I think we said as we look at our coal plants, our business is pretty simple, we serve nine plants and we have the opportunity to serve a 10th in 2015. We have put a red flag on those plants that were either natural gas prices or for EPA regulations are questionable and that could be as much as to the quarter 30% of our coal business. Do we think that we are going to lose 25% to 30% of our coal business, absolutely not? There is a lot of politics involved in this; some of the customers are digging in and saying, we are not going to invest in the scrubbers, we are going to close the plants and that means that we are going to loose jobs and the markets that we serve particularly Texas just are going to need the power and so those plants are going to produce at some level.","With gas prices kind of where they are now in the mid $3 range, most of our plants tell us that they can compete and they can operate profitability at this level, but some of them are not in that position. So it\u2019s like a fire-hose; the analogy I use here internally is like a fire-hose with the water flow blast and no one holding onto it, in terms of the forecast that we are hearing and the possible range of outcomes going forward. And again as I realize it\u2019s not a very satisfying answer for you guys, it\u2019s not a very satisfying position for us, it\u2019s just very hard for us to forecast.","David Starling","One other statement Jason, if you look at the one of these plants in Texas, they burn today a lot of lignite and that lignite is not as clean as the Powder River Basin coal. One of the outcomes out of this could be restricted from burning lignite and they got to switch to Powder River Basin coal. In that instance, we would actually gain coal share and the market would go up from what we previously had.","So I mean, at this by and lot, so this could go a lot of different directions. I think, what the theme is down though, if coal is what it is, whatever the outcome is, that's what we are going to deal with, but we\u2019ve got growth in all of these other commodities; that's what we are focused on; if the coal plants don't close, does not, let them close the plants which this another possibility and we are just going to benefit from that. But we\u2019ve got all the growth and every commodity grew, so that's what we are spending our time worrying about; we\u2019ll deal with what happens with coal.","Mike Upchurch","Jason, this is Mike Upchurch, remember it\u2019s a highly variable cost structure as well, so we don't own this equipment and don't have a fixed cost; (inaudible).","Jason Seidl - Dahlman Rose","Thanks for the addition Mike. Well, let\u2019s talk some of the other business lines, let\u2019s talk for a minute about the cross-border intermodal; obviously you know still growing at a very good clip. Talk about converting new customers and what do you have in the pipeline and getting more people to put those products on the trains and what's the outlook here and in 2013?","Pat Ottensmeyer","The outlook is good as I said in the past, the market is very large. Our share is very low; it\u2019s growing very rapidly so the outlook continues to be bright. We are working with our asset partners who are working with our rail partners to continually look at new markets, look at new service and we will probably get a question later on from someone about adding train starts and are we going to have to add costs to train starts that keep this going and growing at this rate; I sure hope so.","And the more we do that, and the more we build into the balance, the more we will be able to support new service, direct service at some of these markets which will make our service look more truck light and will actually allow us to grow faster.","So in the past if you look at some of the market share for rail versus truck in the well established mature intermodal lanes in the United States, they are in the 40s or approaching 50% we\u2019re at 2%. There is no structural impediment that says we can't get to those market share levels overtime, but if you look at the US railroad or Western railroad particularly Chicago LA is probably the best example, its taken them a lot of years to get to those market share levels. It will take us a lot of years to do that as well, but the growth opportunity is very large.","David Starling","And I might add this. We are still spending CapEx in the intermodal facilities. We will spend another $7 million in monorail next year; we will spend $4 million in St. Louis [OTC] next year as well, so we continue to expand those intermodal facilities to accommodate even more and more volume.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","So in terms of automotive opportunity in Mexico, how should we think about the potential market share that we might be able to gain from the incremental production as new OEMs and specifically as this relates to the cross-border finished vehicle market. So I was wondering maybe what some of it's dynamic or advantages that KSU has that might be able to allow you to move the vehicles cross-border on your network as opposed to having them off to Union Pacific?","David Starling","As far as the market share, we're in discussions with the auto companies now to really better understand where they see the markets and the flows of these plants going; again these plants are not go to open until early 2014. But to your second question, you know, if you are looking at, look at our services and our security advantage in Mexico, this is a real significant factor and you look at the way we can connect those plants over the Laredo gateway to the population centers in the Eastern half or two thirds of the United States, basically, Dallas, Houston, Kansas City, Chicago in East and we can connect with all of the other Eastern railroads and the Canadian railroads. I think we have a pretty good service offering to get those vehicles to gateways where we can connect with multiple other carriers and I think that\u2019s a real significant advantage. There will be competition, no doubt about it and it\u2019ll be stiff, but the combination of our cross-border service, our security and our ability to connect with multiple carriers at other gateways and Laredo are something that factors, that are very interesting to the auto companies.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","And then, I\u2019ve a follow up question in terms of the partnership that you do have with the other Class Is. Maybe if you could talk a little bit about the Class Is that you\u2019ve currently been working with more over the last couple of years. And I guess my question is, which ones are you currently working the least with right now, and have you been in any discussions with these Class Is to potentially increase business with them or form new partnerships or agreements?","David Starling","Well, we\u2019re really working with everybody. We connect with every railroad in the industry, and to some extent, well let me say this, everyone has a strong interest in working with us, because of what they see going on in Mexico and what they see us doing in terms of investing in our franchise and really building a first class network in Mexico. To some extent there are factors like, just the physical connection points and the gateways that we have with the other carriers and how that orients us into their flows that dictates kind of the highest and best of it, if that makes sense.","So, the fact is we\u2019re working with everyone, we\u2019re engaged with the marketing teams at all the other carriers to look for opportunities, and again, because of our unique position in Mexico and what we\u2019ve done to build out the network, everyone kind of wants a piece of that.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay, it\u2019s fair to say that there could be some potential opportunities to work more risk with some other carriers?","David Starling","There are opportunities with all of them. What we are trying to do is find the highest and best fit with each one, and that\u2019s going to be driven by the physical connection points that we have, the gateways and how of those gateways orient us into their [freight] clause.","Operator","Our next question is from Matt Troy of Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Troy - Susquehanna","Thanks. Do we still have Jose on the line?","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya","Yes I am here.","Matt Troy - Susquehanna","I wanted to ask you, since we have got you here today; well given the administrative changes in the Mexican government, just wondering if you could talk about how you are relating with ,them how the relationship is progressing? Talk about may be some of the client [pulse] of the things you are focused on and the next [call] it one, two, three years with the new regime gave concession on your tax rates are just how you are working with the government?","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya","Well I should start by giving you some brief history of our relationship with that team. We started working with (inaudible) Mexico where we run trains and we have a intermodal facility for Mexico there. We started an initiative, a very close working relationship with them. We continue that relationship, we are doing their campaign also. I was invited to the most important event on the campaign, and at this moment I will continue having (inaudible) with some of the numbers of this things that are in the transitional team with their (inaudible) administration. ","So we feel that we have a closer and very good relationship with the whole team, not only with the elected president. We foresee very optimistic the next years in the Mexican economy and that the experience we got the, we\u2019ve seen this team work in on the State of Mexico use for business, [people] more sense a course for an investment and he also is very, very committed to the rule of law. So taking into considerations those facts, we feel very confident and very optimistic about the future of Mexican development and the Mexican economy.","Matt Troy - Susquehanna","I guess, the second question in terms of the near-term house keeping, I understand the situation in coal is fluid and we will find in the coming weeks based on weather and certain gains which we have done in Texas. But we are just curious in the US if I just look at your total consolidated coal power earnings falling 22% in the last quarter four weeks basis, is that just  comp noise or one and two of your customers [throughout] essentially slow plant and currently. Just trying to get a sense, before we bump into the harder comps in November, what might be causing that little blip down in coal near-term?","Mike Upchurch","It\u2019s a little bit of timing and little bit of comp. We had a little bit of surge in the third quarter, just kind of slow down a little bit here and then there is some unfavorable comps (inaudible) the last year, okay.","David Starling","With the noise that's in Texas, we are still moving a surprising amount of coals still forward as planned. ","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Just a quick, and I want to take up a follow-up here. On the (inaudible) target mid-single digit volumes and mid-digit pricing and the estimate single digit revenues. Is that offsetting because of the evaluation of peso. I just want to kind of grab that new forecast on that?","David Starling","No it\u2019s a pretty tight band. I don't think there's any peso impact in that guidance. ","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Can you talk about crude growth noted, you've now going to seat at the table, is this just kind of an incremental cars without additional investment, just want to understand the incremental margin opportunity, and I guess Pat if you want to delve into maybe the size of that opportunity over the next year or two obviously, you know you've accelerated significantly through the years, should we look at this pace being maintained or can you talk about new customers coming out here. Could you just give us some insight on it. ","David Starling","Again Kenneth it\u2019s really hard for us to predict. I think we can sustain this growth, a very high growth even though the base is getting larger for the next few quarters based on business that we are hearing about and business that we've kind of secured and is in the pipeline for this quarter and next year. We are looking at a number of options and talking to a number of potential partners for investments in the Port Arthur area and the facilities or properties that we own that could secure our position even further. ","You know we talked a little while back about this idea of crude terminal working with Savage. That hasn't happened, but what has happened is that some of the customers that we were targeting to be users of that crude oil terminals have actually invested their own capital in their own facilities to take crude by rail, and so we haven't lost the business and we haven't lost the momentum. It just didn't happen the way we thought it would happen. ","But having said that; we are still talking to people who are interested - potential partners and potential customers, who are interested in looking at facilities that we own and investing in crude oil terminals. I listened to one of the railroads earlier this week. I agree that crude oil by rail its something that's going to be around for a long time. I don't think it\u2019s going to end and some of these pipeline investments and reversals are made lot of flexibility, a lot of advantages to crude by rail. ","The thing that we are very excited about is that Port Arthur has a pretty good mix and a pretty good balance of light and heavy, and again with our rail partners we can deliver both, out of Canada, out of Bakken, we can deliver light and heavy and so you know it just really feels good to me that we are in a pretty good position on the origination side. Port Arthur is a very large market, it imports a lot of crude oil and we are seeing tremendous amount of activity there. ","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Can I just review that first answer for a second, I guess its still mathematically doesn't make sense, are you giving yourself conservative room on the volume side given what's going on the coal and Ag side? There is no way I would just, because a mid-single digit plus mid-single digit can't equal mid single digit.","David Starling","Well, it\u2019s a matter of how you define the range this close. ","Mike Upchurch","This is guidance is for full year 2012, we haven't seen anything specific in the fourth quarter. I don't know if that helps you.","David Starling","Yeah, and given the impact of the second quarter, the guidance is for the full year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brad Delco with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Brad Delco - Stephens","I guess somewhat of a follow-up to the last question on the guidance and I think that\u2019s a question given the pretty outlook you guys had longer term. When I think about the guidance, I kind of think of there being a bridge probably in the next few quarters or so, because of [good] coal on the side, but you also have some great challenges that you will be dealing with [probably] on mix. How should we think about with other rail sands, fourth quarter expectations or volumes down that we should be thinking about may the next two quarters in volume growth and how are you guys are going to able to offset any potential headwinds there on the cost side or what you\u2019ve been doing here for last several quarters.","David Starling","I think I lost track of your question. You know, if you just look at some of the areas where we're growing, and we\u2019ll continue to grow kind of little difference in the rest of the rails, obviously cross-border intermodal is a market share plate. You know, it's not out of the question in my mind that we could grow, continually grow cross-border intermodal even if the economy was down. ","You look at crude oil, frac sand. So those areas are kind of unique to our network and our position. On the cost side, I do believe that we will grow faster in our outlook for the fourth quarter is better than what you heard from some of the other rails. Our coal impact is not as large. You know, as [deposit] I can sit here and say, thank god we don\u2019t have CSX coal business. It's not as large as an impact on us, as it is on some of the other carriers that are looking at 30% plus of their business being coal. ","On the cost side, and Dave talked about this that where we\u2019re seeing the weakness, if you think about it, its coal and grain. And we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, those are two areas where you have, because of the nature of the business you have an immediate cost of avoidance when you lose that business. Unit trains, shuttle train, when we lose business or our business is down, we park those trains, we don\u2019t run the locomotives, we don\u2019t burn the fuel, we don\u2019t have the crews and so it\u2019s actually, to lose any business, but it\u2019s actually better to see weakness on the cost side in coal and grain than it is in something like steel and paper, where you\u2019re running in a manifest service, if you lose 25 cars off of a 90 car train, you\u2019re still running the train, when you lose coal business and grain business, you\u2019re parking the train.","Dave Ebbrecht","Hey Brad, this is Dave let me take another, a little shot at this. Yes, one indicator is we do not have any locomotive storage, so even though the coal business has been down and the grain business is down. We have plenty of business growth that has still made us the fastest growing railroad out there and we don\u2019t expect that to change. So even though it could have been much better, it could have been in double digits, if we\u2019d had all the grain and coal, we\u2019re still in a pretty damn good place and we just don\u2019t see that changing.","Brad Delco - Stephens","I guess what I think most people are trying to get at is, with that guidance for fiscal year \u201912, how much of that is based on the momentum you have Q3 to-date versus what your expectations are for maybe fourth and first quarter. I\u2019ll kind of move on maybe to my follow-up, not much has been mentioned about potentially serving in the port in Mexico at Veracruz; is there any color you can add to that and may be some timing around that?","Dave Ebbrecht","Uncertain, the Port of Veracruz has a lot of big plants; we were down there a few months ago. They are building a rail connection that will significantly improve our ability to serve it and that will happen in the first half of next year. So we will be able to improve the way we get in and out of the port and our service will improve. But the port is pretty congested and the main -- I would say the highest and best use today of the Port of Veracruz is automotive. All of the auto companies are interested in using Veracruz for exports either to the East Coast or to other markets and it\u2019s already pretty full.","So the timing of those expansions are uncertain at this point. The Port Authority is counting on and their business model is based on private capital, so they are going to be going out over the next hopefully the next few quarters or next year or so looking for concession operators. But at this point in time, the exact details of where that money is going to come from and the timing of the expansion is unknown.","David Starling","But I will add this that some point the story we will be telling will be the continued growth of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas and the build out of Veracruz, it is going to happen. They have spent so much money down there; it\u2019s just a huge footprint and the fact that they have made the investment to build the railroad connection all the way from the port over to our line is a significant commitment. It will be finished sometime in 2013, so we will then be connected directly into the port and we know in past, I just made a trip to Japan and met with the auto companies and they were all talking about Veracruz as one of the auto loading and unloading points. So Veracruz is coming, it just may not be on the radar screen for the next year or two as far as being built out, but the footprint is there, but you need some concessions in [LatAm] and they haven't done that yet.","Mike Upchurch","Hey, Brad. This is Mike Upchurch, let me make one more attempt to what I think your question is. Our guidance for the year is mid single digit volume growth and core pricing of mid-single digit. But to get to the mid-single digit revenue, you have to look at your revenue per unit, which has generally been flat year-to-date, right. So that's how you get back mid-single digit volume roughly flat revenue per unit, each in the mid-single digit revenue. And our core pricing continues to be positive which allowed us to generate bottomline savings, increase on margins; Pat tried to cover that with respect to the intermodal AND I think the economics there are rather simple, when you add a box in existing train the incremental margins are extremely high.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Let\u2019s switch to free cash generation and as per (inaudible) when you expect to be a cash tax payer, I think you mentioned in the first quarter you will be cash tax payer in US this year, but (inaudible) 2013, so given your reference to having some tax deductions to have this maybe available, when do you anticipate being cash tax payer in US and Mexico please?","Mike Upchurch","Yeah, this is Mike, our goal was obviously to push that date out as far as we possibly can with tax planning strategies. This upcoming election may afford us some additional opportunities, but as of today not knowing what the future tax policies might be, we will be paying cash taxes in both Mexico and the US in 2013. But a simple policy adoption of bonus depreciation as an example would allow us to push out our cash taxes in the US for another year into 2014. So it\u2019s a very fluid situation, but we will begin paying some cash taxes in 2013 that\u2019s our current assumption.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Okay, thanks. That's my first one on cash tax payment strategy as well. Growth in Mexico is really impressive and given the importance and really an impressive growth here, I guess just the curiosity, do you expect the continued growth in your sourcing Tier 1 suppliers will lead to primarily container and box car growth that are capable of productive round trips or is this a significant part of this or it\u2019s going to be something like the railcars that return empty?","Dave Ebbrecht","It\u2019s really going to be both, its going to be, you look at appliance companies where we are seeing more interest in appliances moving in box cars. We\u2019ve had a really good kind of yield management success looking at our box car flows, loading paper into Mexico and reloading appliances out and its finished vehicle and that also there is some southbound finished vehicle going into Mexico but mostly it\u2019s a northbound flow. And in intermodal obviously our strategy on intermodal and our asset partners is to achieve balance, so that will be pretty balanced. And if you look at the truckloads, the 2.5 million to 3 million trucks that I have talked about, it's really pretty balanced.","David Starling","Just in this quarter, we had shutdowns on the auto companies and we were then told that none of the auto companies were going to shut down for first quarter, but they will all be in full production. So just a good sign for where the economy is in the car orders and how the current automotive production in Mexico is remaining very robust.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Sal Vitale - Sterne Agee","Sal Vitale on for Jeff. Just a quick question on the cost side of things. Look at your unit cost, specifically if I am looking at labor cost for a car load, it was down about 7% year-over-year; was there anything particular for the quarter, maybe a comp against an easier number against the harder number rather a year ago and how do we expect that to turn going forward?","Mike Upchurch","I can take that. It's relatively keeping the headcount flat while we're increasing the car load numbers on the train. When you look at our train starts and what we're doing, we're absorbing the growth within our network and so when you have that, it's not necessarily a comp issue; it's just continued growth and we put it over the flat headcount, you are going to see continued productivity increases.","Sal Vitale - Sterne Agee","Okay, and has there been any immediate recovery in coal and grain volume, do you expect your headcount to pretty much trend or pretty much to remain flat over the next call it six quarters or the next year and a half?","David Starling","We expect to continue to maintain leverage and scale well below our growth the headcount. The only comment I would like to add is we still have contracts in Mexico that we\u2019re working on and some of those are performed by outside contractors. It does makes economic sense for us to take over that work and add headcount to do it and take that cost out of purchase materials and you might see that and that might cause a movement in the headcount. But when we do that, it\u2019ll be a net saving.","Sal Vitale - Sterne Agee","Okay. And then, just a follow-up, earlier, pretty much just a clarification on a comment you made earlier, you mentioned that you will see some tough comps in 4Q because of some business you took on, and I think it was December of last year. Was that specific to coal or does that affects other groups as well?","Mike Upchurch","My comment was specific to coal. We took on a new contract staring in November and really picked up in December. So, that\u2019s going to provide some noticeable challenges on the comps in coal.","Sal Vitale - Sterne Agee","Can you give a sense of who [had] the contract for the 3Q for example how may car loads that comprised?","David Starling","I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, I don\u2019t know their specific shipments in the third quarter. I can tell you that it was 12 or 14 trains in December of 2011 that we picked up when we pick up their contract.","Sal Vitale - Sterne Agee","Can you pick it up in early December?","David Starling","It\u2019s already moving in November.","Sal Vitale - Sterne Agee","November.","David Starling","And it really got to full strength in December.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo","Just one housekeeping and then one big picture of housekeeping. Mike, did you say what you thought the fourth quarter\u2019s tax rate would be?","Mike Upchurch","I did not say what the fourth quarter tax rate would be. But yeah, I\u2019ll take the mystery out off that, since you asked a great question there. We guided the 39% for the full year. If you look at our tax rate through the first three quarters, we are at 38.4, and if you do the math on that you are probably going to come up with the fourth quarter tax rate of 41%.","Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo","Just wanted to make sure cause that\u2019s these numbers move around a bit too much. You mentioned that grains are expected to be stronger in the second half of the 2013, can you just elaborate on that. Is that because stocks are going to be rebuild, there is an easy comparison or just an outlook probably that there is one customer that\u2019s made it big. Just a little bit more color on why range should be the way you are expecting the second half of 2013? ","Mike Upchurch","The main reason is that it takes a while to grow crop, and so it\u2019s going to take planting season for things to hopefully get back to normal. I don\u2019t think that we will be as bad as may be some of the other because of the nature of our business, where a lot of our shipments are locked in by contract. Our business is really driven by human food consumption and poultry production for [peers], corn syrup, corn starch; those products which are pretty stable. ","And as Dave mentioned, we\u2019ve got contractual commitments and obligations. So we may have to draw a corn from a larger origination of region, but the main reason for my comment was really just everybody knows this was a weak crop and it takes a while to grow another one.","David Starling"," ","I might add that the two elevators that will be located on our systems, they are not adding those elevators to take care of their current business, that is for growth. So we certainly expect the production from those elevators to be, an increase in the grain that we would normally handle from those customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","It\u2019s been a long call; I will go for two quick ones. The first Mike with the full forward cap of the locos this year, can you give us some color on CapEx for next year. Does that come down? The second question for Pat, on the coal side; I understand there is uncertainty, but it will be helpful if you can help us frame maybe the risk. There obviously has been some talk about some clients that may get shut down. What percent of your coal volume are associated with those couple client center been talked about shutting down for a few months starting in December?","Mike Upchurch","I think, I\u2019ve said earlier 25% to 30% of our coal plans we have a red flag by. Do I think that we will loose 25% to 30% of our coal business? No.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","So just 25 are a third of the clients or a third of the business that you saw and it maybe a difference?","David Starling","It\u2019s really a pretty much both. Tell me who is going to be win the election, tell me what the EPA\u2019s attitude is going to be, tell me what natural gas prices are going to be, it\u2019s just very hard to predict.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","No, no, I understand and I am just trying to get a sense of what the potential risk could be from the clients that already been announced that may shut down for the six months or so, okay.","Mike Upchurch","Scott, this is Mike, on the CapEx question that you had, we have not given guidance yet on 2013, but I would tell you, we are going to make whatever investments are required in this business to capture this growth. You look at the automotive opportunity we have, I mean the growth are already over 30%. We feel very, very bullish about that business segment, and we are going to have to invest in additional equipments to handle that business and we\u2019ll do whatever it takes to do that and we\u2019ll update you on CapEx on our fourth quarter call as we typically do. ","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan","That might be (inaudible). The [CapEx] for autos, is that just power or do you need the facilities. ","Mike Upchurch","No it\u2019s mainly equipment. Auto-Max and other equipment carry those vehicles, and we are just taking delivery of an incremental 30 locomotives by the end of the year. So that's where the bulk of the investment would be. But it remains to be seen over the next few years, how much track infrastructure we\u2019ll invest to get into those facilities. But when those plants are going to be there for many, many years; that's certainly a pretty easy decision for us to make.","Operator","Our final question today is from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.","Tyler Brown - Raymond James","Mike if I could quickly come back to the balance sheet. I know you all have been very focused on deleveraging over the last couple of years. But as we look forward, how should we think about your leverage. Are you guys looking at kind of the target numbers ratio or maybe looking at just $1.5 billion and keeping it steady or how should we think about that in the future.","Mike Upchurch","Yeah, I think we are going to probably try to keep our leverage ratios close to where they are at today. As I mentioned we've already accomplished the objectives that have been established by the agencies, and today it\u2019s more of an issue of macroeconomic conditions in the fiscal [clause] that I think has held their decision the upgrade decision. ","I still think in the next three to six months, you are going to see some positive traction there. But we don't believe we need to have any significant delevering here. We feel very comfortable with our debt levels. As I mentioned, we may chose to use cash to take out the 12.5 that was some of the equipment that we're going to invest in. You could potentially replace that with some low cost financing that we could push out, 20, 30 years if we chose. So I\u2019d probably assume fairly flat levels.","David Starling","Okay, I might add too Tyler that we are still going to work on the 20-80 ratio we have on lease versus owned on equipment. So our goal over the longer-term is to be at least 50-50 on the equipment ownership. We think that\u2019s a prudent number. So that\u2019s another way that we're using our cash on a go forward basis and then like Mike said earlier, we're such a growth company, that I don\u2019t want to be - the worst criticism we could take as a team is not having the capacity that handle the volume. So we're going to make sure that we are very cautious, and are ahead and always were, so we can enjoy this revenue.","Tyler Brown - Raymond James","Okay, perfect. And Pat you made some interesting comments related to the pickup and housing. But have you guys ever tried to bracket maybe what your total exposure is to housing plus construction, and then I don't know if you frame it kind of like how you frame it with the ripple exposure to autos?","Mike Upchurch","It's a little bit hardened to be terribly specific about that. We think it's pretty small right now, obviously that maybe 5% or less.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Starling, I would like to turn the call back over to you for closing comments.","David Starling","Okay, thank you very much. We will see you next quarter and everyone have a great weekend.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"12346":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2014  8:45 AM ET","Executives","David L.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed with the SEC. The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS Web site, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Thank you. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David L. Starling","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to the Kansas City Southern's third quarter 2014 earnings call. I hope that\u2019s not a bad sign. Included in the lineup of presenters today is Jeff Songer, our Senior Vice President of Engineering and Chief Transportation Officer. Prior to assuming his present position, Jeff served as the company\u2019s Chief Engineer and as such was responsible for directing the capital projects that have significantly upgraded and expanded our track and facilities infrastructure over the last few years.","This seems an appropriate time to include Jeff on the call as currently so much attention is being focused on the capacity challenges in the U.S. rail system. We thought it would be benefit for you to hear directly from the person primarily responsible for KCS rail operations and give you his perspective on what we\u2019re doing to stay ahead of the curve.","In a subsequent meeting, we intend to have Mike Naatz speak. Mike is Senior Vice President of Operations and Support and Chief Information Officer. He is essential in optimizing the efficiency and productivity of our operations. Jeff and Mike work very closely together to make sure that KCS gets the optimal benefit from its capital projects in the service network. They\u2019ve made an excellent team.","As usual, Pat Ottensmeyer, EVP of Sales and Marketing; and Mike Upchurch, EVP and Chief Financial Officer will join me in going over the company\u2019s marketing and financial performance. And Jose Zozaya, President and Executive Rep of KCSM will be available to answer questions pertaining to Mexico.","In the interest of time, I\u2019m going to move pretty quickly through my section as one of luxuries of good results, you don\u2019t have to spend a long time explaining things. Revenues for the quarter were up 9% over the last year with revenue in our key strategic growth areas up 19%. As a reminder, we\u2019ve been classifying cross-border intermodal, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, automotive, crude oil and frac sand as strategic growth areas for KCS.","KCS\u2019 operating ratio for the third quarter came in at 66.1, a 1.7 point improvement over the prior year and speaks not only to our business growth but also our system efficiency and cost controls. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 increased 17% from last year\u2019s third quarter number.","Going to the next slide, in terms of matching our performance to the 2014 guidance we provided, the comparisons are all good. Our year-to-date volumes are up 5% right in the mid-single-digit range we projected. Revenue growth in the third quarter is up 10%, slightly higher than our high-single-digit projection. But as you can see on the slide, without the extraordinary increase in our grain business, our revenue growth would be 7%.","Given that the easy grain comps are now a thing of the past, as we said they would be in October or by October, we are going to stick with our high-single-digit forecast for the year. But as we\u2019ve said before, if rail network congestion eases somewhat, coal could be a bit of a wildcard and be a little stronger than anticipated in the fourth quarter that could affect the fourth quarter and year-end-to-date revenues in a positive way.","Year-to-date, our operating ratio has improved 1.8 points from the prior year. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware in September, we slightly modified our operating ratio guidance saying that we felt we\u2019d end the year at the high end of our 1 to 1.5 point improvement. Again, the reason why we are most comfortable sticking with this guidance is that the outsized year-over-year favorability we enjoyed in our cross-border grain business through the first three quarters is behind us now.","Last but not least, in the third quarter, we also changed our 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from the mid-teens to high-teens growth over 2013. Year-to-date, the improvement has been 21%, which gives us the high degree of confidence that we will meet our revised EPS guidance.","With that, I\u2019ll let Jeff Songer provide the operations update.","Jeff M. Songer","Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Turning to Slide 8, productivity as measured by carloads per employee continues to improve. As of the third quarter of 2014, we are handling approximately 30% more volume with fewer employees than in prerecession levels of 2008. While the hiring environment continues to prove challenging, as all railroads are adding resources, we are maintaining appropriate staffing levels to support current volumes and are well positioned into 2015 to continue hiring and training programs to support our growth.","Turning to Slide 9, operating metrics for velocity and dwell for the third quarter improved over the prior quarter and KCS continues to outperform the industry average in these performance areas. While these metrics lag those of third quarter 2013 with velocity and dwell performance down 3% and 9%, respectively, overall, I\u2019m pleased with our performance given the handling of record volume levels. Targeted investment in our infrastructure as illustrated in subsequent slides should allow for future improvement in these metrics.","Slide 10 illustrates Kansas City Southern\u2019s commitment to invest in our future. In 2014, approximately 52% of our total capital investments will support strategic growth initiatives. This category includes capacity projects to support crude oil, intermodal and cross-border volume as well as a procurement of additional locomotives and rolling stock. While investment in core maintenance will begin to normalize, we will continue to focus on maintaining a safe and efficient infrastructure to minimize disruption caused by slow orders and equipment downtime.","Other maintenance projects such as our track infrastructure upgrade between Monterrey and the U.S.-Mexico border will allow for increased velocity in this critical segment. Lastly, I would like to thank our operating team for safely and successfully handling record volume levels this quarter and for the hard work and dedication they continue to show each day.","Now, I will turn the presentation over to our Executive and Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Pat Ottensmeyer.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, we had record revenues and volumes for the third quarter. Revenues were 677.5 million, which was 9% above last year. Carloads increased by 4% to [595.4 thousand] (ph). Revenue per unit increased by 4.7% from last year. Foreign exchange was a slight negative during the quarter reducing revenues by about 20 basis points.","As you can see looking at this slide, except for energy, business was pretty strong across our entire portfolio for the third quarter. The major area of the strength during the quarter were automotive, grain, metals and pulp paper. Primary areas of weakness were utility coal, frac sand and food products, which in part was driven by a specific plant outage.","I\u2019ll spend a few moments now talking about each of the six key business units covered on this page. First, revenues in our chemical and petroleum business increased by 7% on volume growth of 2%. We had revenue growth in all of the major commodity areas in this business unit led by petroleum, which was 16% higher than last year. Our plastic business was also strong with revenues increasing by about 6% over last year.","RPU increased by 5% overall, driven by strength in petroleum shipments primarily in Mexico and strong cross-border volumes which were 11% higher than last year. As you all know, we report crude oil in our energy business units, so petroleum here is primarily refine products and derivatives.","In our industrial and consumer business, we generated revenue growth of 11% on a 6% increase in carloads versus last year. As was the case last quarter, our metals and scrap shipments were strong with revenues in this business up by 13% on volume growth of 8%. We have very favorable mix drivers here as a result of new business with length of haul increasing by almost 6%.","Automobile production and drilling activity were the main drivers for this business. We also saw strength in pulp paper and shipments of military equipment, which is more likely going to be a temporary situation.","Our ag and minerals business had another strong quarter with revenues and volumes increasing by 8% and 5%, respectively. We began to see the trend that we\u2019ve been telling you about for some time now finally emerge as the year-over-year comps began to return to more normal patterns.","You may recall that revenues in this business were up by almost 36% versus last year for the first six months. All of the growth areas in grain and specifically cross-border grain was increased by about 20% versus last year. As I mentioned earlier, our food products business recorded lower volumes and revenues due in part to a temporary outage at a plant we serve.","Moving on to our energy business, revenues declined by 4% on a volume decrease of 3% versus last year. The main driver here was utility coal where revenues and volumes were lower than last year by 4% and 6%, respectively. This is a particularly weak third quarter given that this is normally the peak demand period for our service region.","As I will mention in a few minutes, we expect year-over-year performance will improve for the fourth quarter, again partly driven by easy comps to the fourth quarter of 2013 but also driven by a replenishment of stockpiles that we expect to occur at some of the plants we serve. Eight out of the nine power plants that we serve have reported that stockpiles are lower than desired levels.","For the first time since we started reporting separately, our frac sand business declined versus the previous year. Revenues fell by 12% on a volume decline of about 5% versus 2013. It feels like we are seeing some shifting in the destinations to the Bakken region possibly due to some seasonal and weather-related factors.","In addition, we\u2019ve heard that shippers and sellers are favoring unit train destination terminals. Many of the terminals we serve in our handle units range currently, we don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen the end of our growth period for frac sand and some of these factors will shift in the future to our favor. In fact, we have seen a return to growth so far in the fourth quarter in frac sand.","After three consecutive quarters of decline, our crude oil business returned to a very strong growth trajectory during the quarter with revenues growing by 34% on volume growth of almost 47% from last year. Much of our growth in this quarter was related to deliveries to a terminal that\u2019s a Port of Beaumont, which we began to serve this summer. I\u2019ll talk more about the outlook for crude oil in a few minutes.","Next, our intermodal business continued its strong growth profile with revenues increasing by 11% on an 8% growth in units. As you can see in the appendix in today\u2019s presentation, cross-border intermodal revenues grew by 16%. Revenues related to our L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas business grew by 20%. This L\u00e1zaro growth was encouraging returning after five consecutive quarters of single-digit growth rates at L\u00e1zaro. Our U.S. domestic intermodal revenues related to the Dallas, the Southeast business grew by 23%.","Finally, our automotive business continued its exceptional growth trend with revenues increasing 28% on a 22% increase in carloads. This growth was primarily driven by new business with about 40% of our revenue growth in the quarter was attributable to the three new plants that opened recently in Mexico. We also experienced growth in imports and exports due to the port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Cross-border revenue grew by 79%, again driven primarily by the new auto plants opened in Mexico earlier this year.","Moving to Slide 13, here we show our cross-border revenue trend and you can see that we reached an all-time record at $167 million during the quarter, which was 14% higher than last year and about 4% higher than the previous record, which was in the fourth quarter of 2013. We saw cross-border revenue growth in all business units except energy which is relatively small with particular strength in automotive, which was up 79%; intermodal, which I told you earlier was about 16%; and ag and minerals which was about 20%.","Moving to Slide 14, you will see a different display of the five strategic growth areas that we\u2019ve shown you in the past. We\u2019re beginning to follow the model of our cross-border trend chart that you saw in the previous slide. So you can see over time how these five key growth areas have performed and the trends in both total revenue and percent of revenue that in aggregate they contribute.","As Dave mentioned earlier, the punch line is this. In total, these five growth markets grew by 19% and were responsible for about 20% of our total revenues. This includes the impact of a 12% reduction in frac sand revenues that I discussed earlier. Just so you don\u2019t lose anything in the conversion, the growth rates in the other four groups were as follows. Crude oil grew by 33%, cross-border intermodal by 16%, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas by 20% and automotive by 28%. The total revenue generated by these five groups was about 138 million and was an all-time high for the quarter.","Moving on Slide 15, as you can see on the market update here, we have not changed our full year outlook for any of our six major business units from what we reported at the end of the second quarter. Furthermore, as Dave Starling told you earlier, our guidance for the full year revenue and volume growth on a consolidated basis remains unchanged and that guidance is for mid-single-digit volume growth and high-single-digit revenue growth.","With the exception of energy and ag and minerals both which I\u2019ll talk about in a moment, our current 2014 full year revenue outlook is very much in line with what we reported for both the third quarter as well as nine months year-to-date. We see nothing on the horizon for the rest of the year that would change our full year guidance in those areas.","In the case of energy, revenue for the third quarter as well as for the nine months year-to-date has been below 2013 comps due largely to declines in utility coal and crude oil. We are expecting both of these commodities to show stronger comps during the fourth quarter, reversing the year-to-date declines to show single-digit growth in freight revenues for the full year.","We expect our utility coal customers will replenish their stockpiles from somewhat depleted levels during the fourth quarter and that will drive positive comps in utility coal for the fourth quarter. The opening of new crude oil terminals on our networks to which we are delivering trains today will drive the positive comps versus last year in that area. We believe the combination of those two factors will drive full year revenue in this business to be slightly positive to 2013.","You may recall that last quarter, we increased our full year revenue guidance for ag and minerals from single digit to double digit, based primarily on the strength of grain shipments for the first six months of 2014. As you saw earlier, revenue growth in this business for the third quarter was at 7.2% and we are expecting the fourth quarter comps to be slightly lower than last year due to the exceptionally strong fourth quarter we had in 2013.","So the trend has performed very much like we expected over the course of the year, very strong comps in the first six to eight months, then declining as we move into the end of the year. This is very much in line with what we have been saying to you all year. When you put all that together, we still feel comfortable with our current outlook for double-digit revenue growth for the full year. I\u2019m not going to cover any of the other business units in any details and our outlook remains unchanged from prior reports and very much in line with actual performance so far this year.","I will conclude my comments on Slide 16. We see no significant changes in the positive economic outlook in either the U.S. or Mexico for the remainder of 2014 or as we begin to look into 2015. There are certainly reasons to be cautious about the global economy but business demand feels good to us and the outlook for the North American economy continues to be positive.","I\u2019ve already covered the outlook for grain and coal in some detail, so I won\u2019t repeat it here. Growth from our strategic growth areas continues to be strong and it was encouraging to see the business at the port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas pick up during the quarter. In spite of recent weakness in crude oil prices and spreads, we still feel good about the prospects for long-term growth in our crude by rail business. New terminals are being build in our service regions and as we said for several quarters now, the demand for heavy crude from Western Canada to the refineries in Port Arthur in Beaumont area will be the key driver to our long-term growth.","I don\u2019t have a bullet point on this page about pricing but we believe the pricing environment continues to be positive and expect that increases for the foreseeable future will be above inflation. If we look at all of the contracts and rate quotes that were renewed during the third quarter, our weighted average rate increase was about 5.3%. The dollar value on which this average rate adjustment applies represented about 10% of our annual revenue base.","As I explained last quarter, this is different than same-store sales and that this is an indication of the expected impact of rate negotiations which took place during the quarter and might have on future revenues. Finally, I\u2019ll close by saying that our new business pipeline remains very strong and is growing and we continue to feel very good about the long-term growth prospects ahead of us.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Mike Upchurch.","Michael W. Upchurch","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. As Pat previously indicated, volumes increased 4% and revenues 9% in the quarter. Our operating ratio improved 170 basis points and incremental margins were 52% in the quarter. Reported and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both up 17% and we\u2019ve provided a reconciliation between reported and adjusted in our appendix that primarily represents differences in FX impacts and debt retirement costs.","Our adjusted EPS increase is predominately from increases in operating income and a small tax rate benefit year-over-year. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.6% and that\u2019s consistent with our guidance we provided and we would expect to continue to see a 33% to 34% tax rate for the full year. You can find more details on the P&L taxes and foreign exchange in the appendix.","Moving to Slide 19 represents a summary of our operating expenses and key drivers behind year-over-year increases that we experienced in the third quarter of 2014. Overall, expenses were up 6% versus revenue increases of 9%. As you can see in the bar charts, all expense categories increased year-over-year with the exception of equipment costs, which continued to decline as a result of our lease asset purchases. We\u2019ve experienced an $11 million or 30% decline year-over-year in equipment costs.","In the table to the right, you can see approximately half of our expense increase is volume related, from expenses of fuel, compensation and other directly variable costs. We did see headwinds from higher incentive compensation, depreciation, wage inflation, track maintenance and I\u2019ll cover those in more details in the next few slides.","On Slide 20, our quarterly average headcount increased nearly 3% but continues to achieve near our longstanding goal of maintaining headcount growth below volume growth. Our volume-based compensation expenses were up 5 million in the quarter, wage inflation contributed to a $4 million increase in compensation expense and better-than-expected year-to-date results with our plan led to increased incentive compensation expense of $4 million.","On Slide 21, purchased services increased 7 million or 12% year-over-year. The majority of the expense increase is related to track maintenance for activities such as rail grinding and testing and bridge repairs. The remainder of our purchased service increase is attributable primarily to volume-sensitive costs such as car repairs, switching and to a smaller degree intermodal lift charges.","Turning to Slide 22, fuel expense increased 6 million or 6% year-over-year. Carload increases drove the majority of the change in fuel as the average price per gallon increased only slightly. However, consistent with trends we have seen over the last year, fuel prices continued to decline in the U.S. 7% year-over-year while fuel prices in Mexico increased nearly 11% year-over-year.","And specifically our price per gallon in the U.S. was $2.93 a gallon in the third quarter of 2014 and $3.29 in Mexico. And because of the rising prices in Mexico, our fuel lag benefit was only $900,000. And perhaps just some additional color on future trends that we would expect in fuel prices for our Mexican franchise. The stated policy is to continue to increase fuel prices 3% per month through the end of January and then to try to maintain flat prices through the rest of 2015.","On Slide 23, you can see our equipment costs declined significantly 30% year-over-year and is the direct result of our leased asset purchase program, which to-date has included over $600 million of cumulative purchases. As you can see in the two tables, the equipment purchases resulted in reduction of equipment costs of 8 million, which was partially offset by 4 million of increased depreciation. It\u2019s also worth noting that year-over-year, we saw a $3 million benefit in car hire, again largely a benefit from owning equipment rather than leasing equipment. Finally, our heavy capital investment program continues to cause some headwinds in depreciation, which increased 4 million year-over-year.","Finally, on Slide 24, I\u2019d like to review our capital structure and cash flow priorities. As we have been communicating for some time now, our first priority continues to be to invest in the business and accordingly we are still on track to invest 28% of our revenue in supporting in the growth opportunities. Our focused investment strategy has allowed us to grow our volumes by almost 30% since prerecession levels and staying ahead of growth opportunities by investing in the future will continue to be our focus.","Our Board of Directors will also continue to evaluate our dividend strategy on an annual basis, but we currently do not anticipate material increases in the dividend. And given the magnitude of our investment opportunities, we do not believe stock repurchases are in our foreseeable future.","Finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure by purchasing assets under lease or if leases expire, but we currently own 51% of our equipment that\u2019s up from about 20% two or three years ago and we\u2019ll continue to try to get closer to industry averages of approximately two-thirds ownership. Our overall debt structure is one we\u2019re quite comfortable with and we currently enjoy an industry best average effective interest rate of 3.2%.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Dave.","David L. Starling","Okay, thank you, Mike. Can\u2019t resist this closing remark, I\u2019m sure all our friends on the call are supporting America\u2019s team, the Kansas City Royals, so Go Royals.","Now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. I would like you to limit them to one. We have a lot of people in the queue we want to be able to take everyone\u2019s call, so please limit it to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","David L. Starling","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thank you. Congratulations on good results. So I wanted to talk a little bit about crude. Obviously, there has been quite a bit of market jitters surrounding the drop in [Brent] (ph), but I wanted to get a sense on whether you have a view in terms of heavy Canadian crude a little bit more insulated perhaps in Bakken or Texas crude just given the enormous sunk costs in oil\u2019s end? And then as a follow-up, are you signing any customer commitments with your new partner to bring down the heavy Canadian crude to some of the destination facilities that are coming on line now?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Allison, this is Pat. I\u2019ll answer your question. Yes, we do feel that the Canadian crude is going to behave a little bit differently. Obviously preparing for the call we\u2019ve talked to a couple of our major crude partners and customers just in the last couple of days and the markets are always going to be volatile, they\u2019re going to be subject to economic and political factors that are beyond our control. There\u2019s just a huge amount of investment that is going into this business and we don\u2019t see anything fundamentally changing for the longer term outlook. Regarding your question about commitments with our partner, we actually have multiple partners. I think that\u2019s an important thing to make sure everyone understands is we\u2019ve talked a lot about the Global Partners deal at our facility at Port Arthur, but we have other facilities that we\u2019re serving for crude oil. And yes, we will have contracts and commitments in place. We\u2019re negotiating a couple as we speak. So that will take a little bit of risk out of the equation and give us some better visibility to the outlook for the years ahead. But based on the facility that we serve, based on the commitments that are being negotiated or in place, we still feel that 2015 and beyond are going to be very good growth years for our crude oil business. The Port Arthur market is large and it wants to import the heavy crude and we think rail is going to be a good solution for the long term.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Perfect. And then just maybe switching gears a little bit, you mentioned a slight FX headwind and I know that the automotive business is more highly exposed to the peso. So could you talk about whether there was a material revenue impact there?","David L. Starling","No, there wasn\u2019t. It was very modest in the quarter.","Michael W. Upchurch","Allison, there wasn\u2019t much of an operating income impact either because we have a bit of a natural hedge there with revenues and expenses in pesos offsetting each other.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you so much for the time.","David L. Starling","I\u2019m sorry to just remind everyone, please one question. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Hi, there. Good morning. I don\u2019t know if I should address to Mike or to Jeff but headcount, 3% growth. I think that\u2019s one of the higher growth rates we\u2019ve seen in quite some time. Can you talk a little bit about productivity? Is this sort of getting to the end of that? You\u2019ve had very good margin performance, so how do you think about what\u2019s going to go on with headcount and costs going forward? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Jeff M. Songer","Yes, this is Jeff. I\u2019ll respond to that. The headcount of 3% is fairly (indiscernible) credit cost with U.S. and Mexico and primarily for T&E crews. So as the volume continues to present itself, we will certainly staff accordingly. I think we\u2019re positioned well with the headcount levels we\u2019re at but also hiring and training programs that are underway and will continue to support the growth, I think we\u2019re in a good position.","David L. Starling","I\u2019ll just add to that, Bill, some of the interchanged programs we\u2019re having are because there are now crews available and we\u2019re just not going to get ourselves in that situation.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","That makes sense. Are you able to estimate how much inefficiencies cost in the quarter?","David L. Starling","No, we\u2019ve talked about it but it\u2019s really impossible. And the other thing we are an only system and we\u2019re trying to work together as a system. All the railroads \u2013 to make ourselves more efficient. This is not about competition. It\u2019s about keeping the whole rail system fluid, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really worthwhile to sit down and try to figure out what all those costs are. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some costs on both sides.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yes, makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","David L. Starling","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","I want to ask about pricing. Pat, I think you mentioned renewals in north of 5% and last quarter was more in the 3.5% range. So is this an inflexion and capacity has gotten tighter and we can really start pushing pricing more aggressively or is this kind of just a one-off, just want to get your opinion there? And then do you have any color \u2013 is this more of an improvement in the U.S. or Mexico?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I think it\u2019s pretty similar in both U.S. and Mexico, Scott, and it\u2019s going to \u2013 if you look at the trends month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019re going to see some bounciness, so to speak, in the pricing trends. And as I mentioned, the 5.3 covered about 10% of our total portfolio. So in any given month, in any given quarter it\u2019s going to depend on the nature of the business that we\u2019re re-pricing obviously the competitive aspects of that business. But clearly capacity is tied across all modes of transportation and rates are increasing and our primary focus is to improve our service levels through our capital spending and resources as we spend money and invest capital, we\u2019re got to earn a return that supports that investment and reflects the market around us. So feels like the pricing environment is going to be good for the foreseeable future.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Thanks.","David L. Starling","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Maybe just a question on the process of Mexican legislation, just want to get an update on where we stand. I think we are potentially expecting something maybe this month with a passage potentially in November, just sort of an update on that. Maybe how the bill is looking as it stands right now. Any changes from sort of the working assumptions that it\u2019s going to be a little bit different than was initially passed in the House of Deputies back in February?","David L. Starling","The only thing I can say at this point is yes, it looks like it will be different. We believe that Mexico definitely understands how important the railroad is to the economy and we feel like the way they\u2019ve treated us the last years, they always have had a respect for the rule of law, so we are moving forward on that basis. But we really don\u2019t have anything to report at this time.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","And timing is far to tell at this point?","David L. Starling","Correct.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Okay. Thanks very much for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Good morning. Good results but I\u2019m going to ask you about something else since I got one here. Dave Starling, I wanted to ask your view on consolidation in the industry and whether you subscribe to the view that it could be beneficial to fluidity and capacity if you had some consolidation?","David L. Starling","That\u2019s the only thing I can say. First of all, we don\u2019t operate in Chicago, so we\u2019re not a part of the issues that are happening in Chicago. So I really don\u2019t know \u2013 I\u2019m not an expert on CSK or CP if that actually would provide fluidity or not. I just do know that in the current environment of congestion, I think it would be very hard to the regulatory bodies or even the shippers to get any kind of merger acquisition through that didn\u2019t alleviate some of the congestion to satisfy the shippers. So that\u2019s all I can say.","Michael W. Upchurch","Welcome back, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Thank you, Mike. Is there any more discussion at the Board level? Does this naturally kind of stimulate more discussion for KSU about what could happen eventually or is that not necessarily the case?","David L. Starling","Anytime something like this happens we always have a lively discussion with the Board of what are all the possibilities, but as you well know you\u2019ve been doing this a long time, this comes up once or twice a year, at least once a year there\u2019s some kind of discussions. We keep the Board updated on what the possible consolidations could be, but again and back to the original statement, unless there is a clear understanding that capacity would be greatly improved and that would make the shippers feel better and the regulatory bodies that this was going to be result, I think it\u2019d be a very difficult time for this to happen.","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Okay. Thanks for the perspective. I appreciate it.","David L. Starling","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Good morning, everyone. Mike, I wanted to ask about your U.S. operating ratio because I think in the past you\u2019ve hinted that, look, it\u2019s going to be difficult to get it out of that low 70s range just given the fact that you are short of haul than a lot of the bigger peers and looking at a lot of the connecting traffic flows on your system, but what are some of the longer term opportunities especially just in incrementally better price and pretty solid volume growth here too?","Michael W. Upchurch","Well, we really look at this as one company and while we do file separate Qs and you can back into those numbers, some of the information that Pat discussed around cross-border, our focus is really to try to increase that as a percentage of our business and drive down our overall operating costs whether it\u2019s traffic in Mexico or the U.S. So I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re going to specifically focus on just doing less here, but we\u2019re going to continue our goal of trying to move the operating ratio down each year.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens","Thanks. Good morning. Congrats on the quarter.","David L. Starling","Good morning, Justin. Thanks.","Justin Long - Stephens","Dave, I wanted to get an update on equipment. Any changes to your order or delivery plans for locomotives? And I think last quarter you discussed a potential long-term order for railcars. Is there any update on that process and the number of units you feel like you need to add to your fleet over the next couple of years?","David L. Starling","Well, locomotives; I think we\u2019ve already talked about locomotives. We\u2019ve already ordered 85 for this year. A lot of them are being delivered in this back half of the year. In fact we get most of them in the next couple of months and we got deliveries coming in, in the first and second quarter. A lot of that is built around a new crew by rail business that we think we\u2019ll be seeing out of Canada going to the Gulf. Rolling stock, grain cars, there is always automotive cars, but we\u2019re very dependent on GTX to increase the boxcar fleet, double-stacked car fleet and GTX has got a very big order in this year for more cars for the whole industry. We\u2019ll be meeting with our Board, Justin, in November and at that time we\u2019ll be laying out a three-year strategy on car acquisition. So hopefully on the next call we can give you more color on that.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it at that. I appreciate the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Good morning, gentlemen.","David L. Starling","Good morning.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Just had a question regarding the CapEx, which has landed towards capacity additions, fluidity improvements and so forth and continues to sit at about 28% of revenue, which is a good 10 percentage points or so above other railroads to perhaps have property that\u2019s in better shape. How would you see this percentage proceeding forward? Is it going to be tailing off over the next five years, eight years to more of a 18%, 19% level or are we going to be sitting at this level for the foreseeable future?","David L. Starling","Well, first of all, I don\u2019t think that the other railroads are in better shape. But if you look at the CapEx, a lot of the CapEx is being spent for growth as Jeff\u2019s graph noted about 52% has been on growth and we\u2019ve been growing faster and we want to stay out ahead of the volume. The way you stay out ahead of the volume is you have to continue to invest in your network even during times where you the volume may not support it, you\u2019re only going to be wrong for a year and I think that\u2019s being proven now with the volumes coming on and actually our system is fairly fluid. So some railroads are playing catch-up right now. It\u2019s more expensive to do that. You\u2019ve got more dissatisfied customers. So we\u2019re not apologizing for CapEx as long as we have the growth trajectory that we do, then you\u2019ll see the CapEx. The average over the last few years has actually been around 24%. The reason it\u2019s 28% this year is because we bumped up the locomotive order simply because there\u2019s a problem in sourcing locomotives and if you don\u2019t get the order in, when you do get ready to order locomotives they may not be available. So the answer to your question is as long as we\u2019re growing, we\u2019re going to invest a sufficient amount of capital to handle the volume.","John Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus","Thanks very much for the thorough answer.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. I\u2019d like to ask on L\u00e1zaro. Are you seeing any benefit or do you anticipate benefiting from the core congestion that we\u2019re seeing out in LA, Long Beach?","David L. Starling","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen actual volumes. We\u2019ve seen interest in longer term, some of the carriers shifting volumes for L\u00e1zaro particularly to serve the Gulf Coast beyond Houston and maybe some of the markets in the Southeast. So we haven\u2019t seen any actual results, but we\u2019re having those discussions with a few of our ocean carrier customers for longer term decisions and diversions. And as you know, the new terminal that APM is building next year I think is going to open up and change the competitive landscape of L\u00e1zaro and we think that could be a driver for more traffic targeted to the U.S. market.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","Yes, thanks for taking my question. So you addressed forward pricing expectations earlier when talking about renewals, but looking to 2015 specifically can you talk a bit about what kind of visibility you have with the volume growth on the network from there, what variables we should think about for next year and how comfortable do you feel today with sort of the street consensus bar for mid-teens earnings growth into 2015?","David L. Starling","You\u2019re primarily interested in volume or earnings?","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","A little bit of both.","David L. Starling","We\u2019re kind of the final stages of our plan for 2015 and beyond. I\u2019ll speak to the volume growth and maybe Mike can touch on earnings. But a big driver of our volume growth next year is going to be the five key areas that we focused on. Automotive, 40% of our growth this quarter was related to new plants and those plants are going to continue to ramp up in 2015. So barring any kind of event in the economy and affecting auto sales in general which obviously we\u2019re not immune to, we think we got good visibility there. Crude oil, we\u2019ve got new terminals that have opened and contracts that are being negotiated. So we think we\u2019ve got good visibility there as well. So as I\u2019ve said to the team here, we spend a lot of time forecasting and projecting and the only thing I know for sure is that the numbers we come up with are wrong, but you just don\u2019t know in what direction and by what magnitude. I feel like we\u2019ve got a planning process and visibility with our customers that is pretty solid and grounded in reality, so I think we\u2019ve got good visibility into next year on the revenue side.","Michael W. Upchurch","I think on the earnings side we\u2019ll probably hold off until January to give our annual guidance.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna","All right. Well, thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Great. Good morning. Go Royals sounds good. Any thoughts on timing of the equipment lease conversions, any big contracts coming up, I guess \u2013 maybe talk in terms of scale if you\u2019re looking to go up to 65% from 51%, what does that mean in terms of [OR] (ph) points and capability and again timing on that?","David L. Starling","Yes. Ken, I wish we could give you specific numbers there. We\u2019re still in the process of looking at a number of leases that come up over the next year plus and haven\u2019t made any final decisions on that. So the timing and the magnitude of that benefit are still very much up in the air. But I think as we have said over and over, we think this is a five-plus year journey. We started it in 2011, believe that there is a 200 to 250 basis point overall opportunity ahead of us during that period of time and I think there is still an opportunity for us to continue to drive that operating ratio down and we\u2019re working very closely with Jeff and Mike Naatz\u2019s team and trying to finalize those assumptions. So maybe in January we\u2019ll have a little bit better answer for you there. But rest assured, we want to continue to move that percentage up and get some additional benefit in operating ratio there.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Just to understand that, is it more weighted over time or is there something more specific coming up maybe even in 2015 that we should look out for?","David L. Starling","There are some opportunities in 2015.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Okay. I appreciate the insight. Thanks, guys.","David L. Starling","That Go Royals was spoken only as a true Yankee fan.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","The [Jim\u2019s] (ph) of George Brett running on the field.","David L. Starling","We both said the two final teams were not\u2026","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","The season is already over.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Mims with FBR Capital. Please proceed with your question.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David L. Starling","Good morning.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Pat, a question for you on chemicals. Obviously, people have been talking a while about the big growth and the build out in the petchem complex in the Gulf region, but I started hearing some rumors and maybe just some chatter about some of those projects being delayed because of labor shortages and inability to get resources down there in that region. Are you hearing that from any of your customers that growth in that segment may be a little bit longer tailed than originally felt or are you still confident in the timeline as far as when those things come on line and we start to see the volumes from the chemical side and the plastic side?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes, we are hearing it not as much from customers as we are from other people who are kind of informed and focused on that whole opportunity that\u2019s the whole phenomenon. But we said we don\u2019t expect and we haven\u2019t been very specific about timing or magnitude in terms of the way we have described our opportunity. We\u2019ve talked about it in 2016, 2017. Some of the plants and primarily smaller plants have been built. The large mega-plants, some of them are under construction and we know that that gives us a little better visibility regarding the timing. But yes, we have heard that one of the factors that might constrain that opportunity or limit that opportunity is labor and engineering and other factors that could delay some of those plants. But whether it\u2019s 2016, '17, '18, I think we still feel that there\u2019s going to be a very big opportunity for us.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, so no real cancellations or real delay \u2013 formal delays right now, it\u2019s still kind of speculation.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes, not that I\u2019m aware of. I\u2019m not aware of any plants that have been cancelled but a lot of them are still in the planning stages and the timing is uncertain. And of the companies we\u2019re working with, we\u2019re not being told by them there\u2019s a delay.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thanks and good morning.","David L. Starling","Good morning.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Regarding Mexican auto volume in addition to addition productions coming on line now and the next couple of years, I\u2019d like to hear perhaps some elaboration on additional dynamics that could affect this business over the longer term by assuming other legacy pricing agreements or shifts in length of haul you\u2019d anticipate or decline in traffic that you handoff to it from other locations that the Mexican production would be displacing? Thanks.","David L. Starling","Okay. You managed to get three questions in one. We\u2019re ramping up the plant that were opened earlier this year. I think we talked about last quarter. In the last six months or five or six months, there have been three new plants announced; Kia, BMW and Nissan has another plan that they\u2019re building with coproduction with Mercedes. The Audi plant is under construction in the Mexico City area and they\u2019ll open next year. So again, that\u2019s just pretty phenomenal when you think about it, three new auto plants announced in Mexico in the last four or five months. We think there will be more. We don\u2019t think that this is displacing any traffic. We\u2019ve looked at our parts business and steel and other things to try to understand how this is going to affect the flow and movement of components and parts and other materials used in auto production. We could see some shifting in our intermodal and steel business as sourcing over time becomes more local to where the plants are located as opposed to \u2013 for example parts moving from the Great Lakes area down to Mexico which is a big part of our intermodal business today that it\u2019s really hard to see how that\u2019s going to shift. The long and short of it is for a lot of factors that we\u2019ve talked about, the favorability of Mexican manufacturing not just automotive but manufacturing to serve North America and really we\u2019re hearing in the case of the BMW plant one of the factors that they considered was Mexico\u2019s attitude toward free trade. A lot of those vehicles are going to be exported not just to the U.S. but other markets around the world and Mexico\u2019s position regarding free trade is becoming a factor for manufacturers locating there. So all those factors continue to be positive and we think that there could certainly be more automotive plants announced in the foreseeable future and not just automotive but across other industries as well. I\u2019m not sure I satisfied your question, but we certainly see a very positive outlook for automotive growth in Mexico.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thanks. I recognize I snuck a little extra in there but one of them was legacy price agreements or length of haul\u2026?","David L. Starling","Most of the new plants obviously the contracts are fairly fresh, so we feel good about those. There is a big opportunity for us. They majority of our automotive and auto parts business we handle in Mexico and we will have opportunities as some of those legacy contracts expire to move some of that business into our U.S. network. So we\u2019re certain to face formidable competition from the incumbent carriers and so we\u2019re not counting on that in our forecast and guidance, but I believe we will have opportunities and there will be interest for our auto customers to use our network in the U.S. to a greater degree and explore other options. So that is an opportunity over the next few years. The timing probably two or three years out and the likelihood and magnitude is very uncertain and we know that we\u2019re going to face stiff competition.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Franz with Raymond James Financial. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James Financial","Hi. Good morning, guys.","David L. Starling","Hi, Tyler.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James Financial","Hi. This one might be for Dave or Pat, but just curious about \u2013 if you could talk about the impact that the new Wylie, Texas intermodal terminal might have on your intermodal franchise. How does it fit in strategically? Is it just replacing your other Dallas terminal and then maybe when is that expected to come on line?","David L. Starling","Well, that\u2019s one of my pet projects, so I\u2019ll probably give you too long an answer but the facility we had in (indiscernible) was five stub tracks, very inefficient. When a train would arrive, it would take us a couple of hours to get it all spotted. When we got ready to depart a train, we had to have a very early gate because then it took us an hour to get the train altogether to depart it. The new terminal is going to be very efficient. We can yard the entire train. As soon as the train stops, you start making the cargo available. You\u2019ll be able to run a very competitive gate because again your train will be made up, put together, so you can go trackside and load outbound. So not only were we congested, but it was very, very inefficient and just was a lousy intermodal terminal.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James Financial","And it\u2019s mostly focused on domestic.","David L. Starling","That is correct.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And the domestic, we had one month where it grew 16%.","David L. Starling","For this quarter, it was up 23%. So that Dallas to the Southeast market is a good growth market for us and the fact it the (indiscernible) terminal is pretty much tapped out and we don\u2019t call it the speedway for nothing. I mean it is the best route to the Southeast, so we\u2019re seeing more growth with all different types of carriers including the FedEx\u2019s of the world that are gradually moving more cargo through there. Again, it\u2019s a great route. We\u2019ll finally have a modern terminal with an automated gate with all the features a terminal should have today. So we\u2019ll open that hopefully in May. I\u2019m looking at Jeff over here. He\u2019s nodding his head, so we\u2019ll be very pleased, very proud of that terminal. It should be one of our prime terminals in that Dallas market to be the speedway. The other thing that that will allow us to do is we\u2019re going to repurpose the (indiscernible) property and we\u2019re talking to a number of our transload partners as we speak to find ways to put that facility to use for other revenue.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James Financial","Perfect, great color. Thanks.","David L. Starling","Thanks for asking about (indiscernible) and Wylie.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Good morning and thank you. Coming back to questions asked before about the crude oil and chemical franchises, but to ask about the impact of recent volatility in crude oil prices. Have you seen any reactions from your customers not just crude oil but also frac sand and chemical to this recent volatility we\u2019ve been hearing about just of CapEx caps or delays, any news on that front for you? And if you could discuss the flexibility to adjust your own spending plans just with your customers plan change? Thank you.","David L. Starling","I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen volatility yet related to the pricing. Again, our play in the crude oil business is Canadian crude to the Gulf Coast and that business has been growing very nicely for the past several months and this quarter. But we haven\u2019t seen an impact yet. On the frac sand, I wouldn\u2019t say that the impact on our business has been because of pricing. It\u2019s really been more supply shifting and some constraints that I mentioned earlier about our network not having the ability to handle unit trains. But we\u2019re certainly keeping a close eye on what\u2019s going on with pricing and spreads. But all I can say again, I said it earlier that we\u2019ve been in close contact with our customers and partners and there\u2019s just a huge amount of capital that\u2019s being invested to support crude by rail to our service region and it will always be subject to short-term volatility and pricing and spreads and economic pressures. But longer term, we still feel that we are very well positioned and we think we\u2019re going to see good growth for several years ahead. So the answer to your question \u2013 the short answer is we really haven\u2019t seen the impact yet of the spreads but longer term, we think the fundamentals are very solid.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David Starling","Thank you.  Good morning and thank you for joining us for Kansas City Southern\u2019s second quarter earnings presentation.  Joining me today will be Dave Ebbrecht, EVP of Operations; Pat Ottensmeyer, EVP of Sales and Marketing; and Mike Upchurch, EVP and Chief Financial Officer.  Also joining us by phone this morning is Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, President and Executive Representative of KCM from Mexico.","If you go to Page 5 on the overview, I\u2019m going to keep my opening remarks brief and let Dave and Pat and Mike get into the specifics of the second quarter.  However, I would like to say our profit in the face of the lower than anticipated utility coal carloads, some foreign exchange headwinds, and an uncertain economy, KCS had a good quarter and in certain areas a very good quarter.  That we set second quarter records for revenues, carloads and operating incomes speaks to the overall strength of the KCS Rail franchise and underlines the fact that our growth story is very much intact, and that our key growth areas gained significant momentum.  ","For example, look at our cross-border intermodal business.  In 2011, cross-border intermodal carloads increased by 56%.  We were very impressed by that until the first quarter of 2012 when carloads increased by 78%.  Again, we were impressed with this growth until the second quarter when the year-over-year volume growth hit 106%.  It\u2019s very exciting to see the percentage growth nearly double from 56 to 106% as the base actually gets larger.  ","This growth is extremely important for us for a number of reasons.  First, it validates what we have said for a while now \u2013 there\u2019s a huge market for a premium intermodal product between the U.S. and Mexico, and that market will continue to grow.  KCS is in the enviable position of being the only railroad that had single-line service on both sides of the border and controlled the primary gateway between the U.S. and Mexico.  We\u2019ve invested in our network to ensure we can provide the service necessary to successfully convert a large percentage of the business from truck to rail.  Now that the infrastructure is in place and our truck and rail partners are fully engaged, we\u2019re seeing the results.  And what is especially exciting, we\u2019re still at the very beginning of what promises to be many years of expansion growth.  ","The second aspect that makes cross-border intermodal important to us is that it represents some of the longest haul traffic on our network, which along with the high incremental margins we\u2019re enjoying in this business segment makes this line of business quite profitable.  ","I don\u2019t want to steal all of Pat\u2019s thunder, but by no means was cross-border intermodal the only bright, shiny object in the second quarter.  Traffic on Lazaro Carde\u00f1as remains strong and automotive continues to grow rapidly.  We\u2019re also experiencing the ripple effect of automotive growth on our other commodity areas.  And as Dave Ebbrecht will illustrate in a few minutes, KCS\u2019 operational performance continues to excel and our safety statistics just get better and better.  The two really go hand-in-hand.  As you have heard me say in the past, a safe railroad is inevitably a well-run railroad, and that KCS is both is having a very definite, positive impact on our profitability.","While there are certain mixed signals regarding the direction of the economy, we do feel that some of the bright spots in the economy are having positive impacts on our business.  Most notably the surge in automotive sales is certainly being felt in a number of our commodity groups.  More over, the very solid manufacturing numbers we\u2019re seeing related to Mexico are being reflected in our KCS volumes.  I don\u2019t by any means want to suggest that KCS is immune from the mood of uncertainty which is prevalent regarding the direction of the global economy.  We are certainly impacted by it, but there are enough positives in the economy for KCS to maintain strong volume growth in the present business environment.","We are also very satisfied with the outcome of the Mexican presidential election.  Jos\u00e9 Zozaya has a good working relationship with President-Elect Pe\u00f1a Nieto.  We believe his administration will be pro-business and we\u2019re confident that the relationship between our company and the Mexican government will remain solid and positive.","If you\u2019ll turn to the next page, second quarter results, I\u2019m going to let Pat and Mike get into the nuts and bolts; but I would like to say we are certainly enjoying reporting the 62.6 second quarter operating ratio, but we understand the comparative adjusted second quarter operating ratio of 70.5, representing a 1.2 point improvement over last year, is the important number.  Our second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.85 compared to last year\u2019s adjusted diluted EPS of $0.71.  ","If you turn to Page 7, finally despite some of the volumes and foreign exchange challenges in the quarter, KCS remains mostly on target in terms of its 2012 guidance.  Year-to-date volume growth of 6% is solidly within the mid-single digit range we laid out in January.  Pricing also continues to be mid-single digit.  Our year-to-date revenue increase of 7% is tracking somewhat below our low double-digit projection.  I will point out, however, that the combined effect of lower than anticipated coal volumes and a weaker peso amounted to a 4% negative impact on our first half revenues. ","Finally, our year-to-date adjusted operating ratio is 1.9 points improved over the adjusted operating ratio for the first half of 2011, which among other things speaks to the Company\u2019s ever-improving operating efficiencies and the overall profitability of its commodity areas.  I\u2019ll come back at the end of the meeting with a few comments on how we see the remainder of 2012 playing out and how that could transcend into 2013 and beyond; but now, let me turn it over to Dave Ebbrecht.","David Ebbrecht","Thanks, Dave.  Turning to Slide 9, I want to start out by emphasizing the importance of our safety efforts at KCS and the value it has provided for the Company.  We\u2019re very proud of the recognition of our best-in-class safety award of May.  Not having injuries, not having accidents and not having derailments is not only great for our employees and the public, but it also adds value to the bottom line.  Our injury claims are down 43%, total liabilities down nearly 60%, and our total casualty expense is down 60% compared with the same period in 2008 when we had higher headcounts and higher train activity.  Recognizing that the cost of failure in our business can be expensive, we continue to improve our standards in the future and ensure safety is at the forefront of every decision.","Turning to Slide 10, I would like to re-emphasize our consistent ability to control costs.  As you can see, ops costs, which is the bottom red line on the chart, has remained largely flat over the past three years as we have experienced a significant increase in line haul revenue.  Our judicious expense management and cost control in these areas continues to be a major driver of our OR improvement.  ","On Slide 11, you can see our headcount controls are still improving with growth.  As I stated last quarter, we would see as seasonal dip in this efficiency metric due to the 13,000 less carloads shipped from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, but it would return to greater efficiency in the second quarter as carloadings improved.  We still expect our efficiency to trends upwards throughout the year as our headcount will remain relatively flat in the future.  ","On Slide 12, you can see our operating metrics continue to remain in a very good range for the second quarter.  Velocity continues to be strong, averaging above 27 miles per hour.  Dwell and car efficiency showed very good trends of fluidity with the increased volume handled.  A slight uptick in maintenance away slow orders is due to the heavy maintenance away activity on the Shreveport and Saltillo subdivisions, but the slower track speed has had no material impact on velocity and dwell.  Our main message from operations is that we will continue to scale costs well below volume and revenue growth projections.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Pat for sales and marketing.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning, everyone.  I will start my comments on Slide 14, which shows revenues, volumes and RPU by major business unit.  As you can see overall, revenues were 545.3 million, a record for any second quarter and 2% above last year.  Volumes increased by 4%, average RPU declined slightly, which was a function of mix.  As you\u2019ll see later, the very rapid intermodal growth had impact on that revenue per unit.  As you\u2019ll also see in a moment, adverse foreign exchange movements reduced our revenue growth by about 3% during the quarter.  ","I\u2019ll go quickly through the business unit details.  First in the chemical and petroleum business, as we explained last quarter, one of the major contributors to the decline was the loss of one petroleum move due to a dispute between one of our customers and one of their shippers.  This impact continued in the second quarter and represented about 3 points on volume and revenue for this business.  This customer is beginning to gradually return in the third quarter, and the comps for the rest of the year should be pretty positive in this business.","The industrial and consumer growth was driven largely by strength in metals and paper.  It\u2019s worth noting that we saw some strength in our lumber and building products business during the quarter, still nowhere close to where it was a few years ago but the trends certainly look good.  Ag and mineral revenue and volume were lower than last year, due in part to tough comps as the second quarter of last year was the best ever in this business.  Additionally, we did lose some cross-border business:  a corn syrup move that went through a facility that we don\u2019t serve, and then another loss of a cross-border customer due to an explosion at one of their facilities that we serve.  This facility will be back in service in September and we\u2019ll begin to see that business come back into the fourth quarter.","I\u2019m going to skip the energy business and we\u2019ll cover that in more detail in a minute.  The intermodal business unit broke records across the board.  Second quarter revenue, RPU and volume were all records.  As Dave mentioned, our cross-border business continues to be very, very strong, and I\u2019ll talk more about that in a minute.  Automotive revenues were higher than any prior quarter in spite of a fairly significant negative foreign exchange impact.  Revenue would have been up 33% and RPU up 13% if the foreign exchange rate had just been flat from last year.  Automotive cross-border revenue continues to see double-digit increases, and I\u2019ll talk more about the longer term outlook in the auto business in a few minutes.","Moving to Slide 15, you can see the factors contributing to the change in revenue; and as I mentioned, the decrease in utility coal and the weakening of the Mexican peso created headwinds that cost us about 5% revenue growth in the quarter.  Volume growth and increase in fuel surcharge revenues contributed 10 million to the revenue growth.  Rate and mix were positive as well.  We continue to see core pricing in the mid-single digit range as we have reported in the past.","If you look at Slide 16, this shows average daily carloadings by month since the beginning of the year.  There are a couple things I would like to point out on this slide.  First, you can really see how strong January and February were versus last year.  As we mentioned last quarter, it feels to us that some of the unusual strength in the first quarter pulled some business ahead and out of the second quarter, which kind of explains how we got off to a little bit of a weaker start in April and May in addition to the impact of the utility coal.  The second point on this slide is that you can see the trend is increasing steadily over the course of the second quarter and actually hit record levels in June, where we showed an 8% higher average daily carloadings than last year.  The acceleration throughout the quarter was driven primarily by utility coal, but we saw strength in industrial and consumer and intermodal and automotive as well.","Slide 17 shows the moving pieces in our energy business unit.  As was the case in the first quarter, our coal volumes dropped primarily due to the warm spring weather across our region, extremely low natural gas prices.  In fact, our utility coal volumes are up further from the first quarter levels.  As you will see on the next slide, however, we are seeing improvements in utility coal volumes from the low point in March.  Frac sand continues to somewhat offset the loss in utility coal.  Crude oil is also growing from a small base.  The frac sand business grew about 60% from the second quarter of last year, and crude oil shipments grew by over 100%.  Unlike the first quarter, however, the frac sand and crude business did not offset the decline in utility coal.","As I mentioned earlier, we believe that utility coal volumes hit bottom in the spring and we have seen, as you can see on Slide 18, steady improvement every month since March.  While the extreme heat we are experiencing across most of the country and most of our service regions should drive some increase in demand, the continued low price of natural gas and relatively high coal stockpiles will likely keep volumes from growing further from these levels.  As much as I should avoid making predictions about the future of the coal business, especially after being pretty far off last quarter, it feels like the worst is behind us and volumes should continue at or near June and July levels going forward through the rest of the year.","The next slide, Slide 19, shows our cross-border revenue, which was down slightly from the first quarter but 2% above last year.  Factors contributing to the sequential decline include low cross-border grain shipments, lower food products volumes, which was the corn syrup business that I mentioned earlier, lower DDG volumes.  In addition, I mentioned earlier that we lost some cross-border business due to an explosion at one of the grain facilities that we serve.  If we had moved this business during the quarter, our cross-border revenue growth would have been 4% higher than last year.  Also as I mentioned, this facility will reopen in September and overall we expect to see cross-border volumes increasing over the course of the year.  I think the key point here is that our cross-border growth story remains very much intact and the business will continue to show a long-term positive trend line, but there will be occasional dips driven by seasonal factors and customer-specific issues.","The next slide, number 20, shows intermodal growth, cross-border growth.  What is remarkable here is that the base is growing and the growth rates are actually increasing.  Since we opened the Victoria Rosenberg line in mid-2009, our cross-border intermodal volumes and revenue are both about five times higher than they were before in just a little over three years\u2019 time.  All of our key asset partners are highly engaged in seeing outstanding results.  Our top six customers all recorded double or triple-digit volume and revenue growth from last year.","As Dave mentioned earlier, the punch line to this slide is that the network is in place, our key partners and customers are very highly engaged, the market is huge, and we have very low market share at this time.  This business is well positioned for strong growth for a long time to come.","Moving to Slide 21, you will see the Lazaro Carde\u00f1as growth story remains strong as well.  Volumes and revenue were up by 20 and 30% respectively.  The revenue growth was driven primarily by the volume, but we also had strong core pricing growth during the quarter for our international business.","Moving to Slide 22, this is where I\u2019ll take some heat from the first quarter guidance.  I\u2019m sure you all remember we guided to low double-digit growth for the quarter, and low double-digit growth in the energy business unit.  Well obviously, that did not happen.  As you can see on this slide, we are now guiding to mid-single digit revenue growth for the full year.  Early in the year, we were assuming that the peso would remain stable at about 12.9 per U.S. dollar.  In late May, the exchange rate climbed to over 14, and June ended with an average of right at 14.  This deterioration in the peso will cost us about one point of revenue growth for the full year.","Additionally, the reduction in fuel prices will drive our revenue forecasts down another point.  We expect fuel prices for the remainder of the year to decline by approximately 10% in the United States and 2% in Mexico.  As we have stated in the past, and this is a very important point to reinforce, neither fuel nor foreign exchange have much of an impact on operating income or operating ratio as the expense savings is almost equal to the revenue loss.  ","The bigger factor in our revised guidance is utility coal, and I think that story is pretty well understood at this point.  Based on the best information we have from each of our utility customers at this point in time, which is a very big disclaimer, our current coal forecasts will take two full points off of our full-year guidance.  I think this reconciliation is pretty simple and straightforward, and as you will see flipping to the next slide, the change in our guidance is really isolated to the energy business, and more specifically to utility coal.  With the exception of energy, the full-year guidance for every other business unit is exactly the same as it was at the end of the first quarter and pretty consistent with what we are seeing on a year-to-date basis.","Our chemical and petroleum business is slightly negative year-to-date, but the recovery of the cross-border customer that I mentioned earlier and other factors should produce improved comps for the rest of the year, so we still feel that it will be positive for the full year.  Industrial and consumer will continue to benefit from strong metals and paper and hopefully some continued strength in lumber and building materials.  At this point, we still feel that the ag business will be positive for the full year, but we are very conscious of the impact of the weather and the drought in the midwest; and depending on how that continues, the outlook could change.  Most of our growing region, which is in Iowa and Nebraska, is still okay.  Missouri and further south is very dry and the crop is not in good condition.  It\u2019s also important to remember that most of our cross-border grain is driven by human consumption, and we feel that that will create some stability in the demand side.","As I mentioned earlier, the energy outlook has been adjusted to reflect the year-to-date results and the latest information available from each of our customers.  We continue to expect significant growth in both our intermodal and automotive business, so when you put all this together, we are currently expecting full-year line haul revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits from 2011.","Moving to Slide 24, I\u2019ll make some comments about the broader outlook for our business.  First, we are expecting positive economic environment in both the U.S. and Mexico for the rest of the year.  Second, we see no fundamental change in our pricing outlook and are quite comfortable continuing guidance in the mid-single digit range.  At the risk of being burned again by coal, we really believe that the worst is behind us, at least in the short term, and we would see volumes and revenue stabilize at recent levels going forward.  I\u2019ve already talked about the cross-border growth outlook for intermodal, and I think the numbers there speak for themselves.","Our longer term new business pipeline continues to grow.  With the exception of the coal business, the emerging energy markets driven by the abundant supply of natural gas and crude oil in North America will provide attractive growth opportunities.  In frac sands, drilling price crude oil, we are seeing these markets grow already, as you saw earlier.  In addition, as we stated last quarter, we believe sustained low natural gas prices will drive growth in ethane and ethylene-based production in products like polyethylene.  Over the last year, companies such as M&G Polymers, Chevron Phillips, Formosa Plastics, Dow and others have announced plans to build new production facilities in the Gulf region.  While it\u2019s too soon to know what these announcements will mean in terms of volume, revenue and timing for us, we feel this will be an important growth opportunity for KCS given our position in the region.","I\u2019d like to spend a little more time on the longer term outlook and update you on some of the automotive business since there is so much activity right now in that area.  The short story is this \u2013 based on new auto plants being built in Mexico, finished vehicle production is expected to grow by more than 30% from current levels over the next four years.  Automobile production has a large freight ripple effect with parts, steel, plastics, soda ash for glass, et cetera.  And finally in the case of KCS today, the majority of our auto-related business moves only on our Mexican franchise.  Over time, we expect to move more of that traffic on our own cross-border network to markets and gateways that we serve in the U.S.","Moving to Slide 25, you can see our network with the existing and new auto plants shown.  I\u2019ve highlighted the three new plants currently under construction for Nissan, Mazda and Honda.  Combined, these three plants will have an annual production capacity of more than half a million vehicles.  A fourth plant for Audi has been announced but the details, including exact location and production capacity, are not currently known.  ","Moving to Slide 26, based on those new plants and expansions underway at other facilities, finished vehicle production is expected to grow from about 2.5 million units last year to 3.5 million in 2015, a 40% increase over 2011 and more than 30% increase from current production levels.  ","And finally on Slide 27, I mentioned the large freight ripple effect that\u2019s driven by finished vehicles.  This slide puts that into a little better perspective.  Driven largely by the increase in automobile production, we know of five new steel plants and processing centers that are also under construction in our service region.  It\u2019s again too early to know what this will produce in terms of volume and revenues, but it will represent a significant growth area for us in the future.  It\u2019s difficult to quantify precisely how big this ripple effect is, but our automotive and auto parts business is about 12 to 13% of our total revenue; and when we add steel, plastics and other products, we believe our auto-related business will be in the mid to high teens.  Again, the market is going to grow by more than 30% from current levels, and our growth will also be driven by how successful we are in driving a higher level of cross-border business.","And with that, I will turn it over to Mike Upchurch.","Michael Upchurch","Thanks Pat, and good morning everyone.  I\u2019m going to start my comments on Page 29.  Pat\u2019s already covered revenues, so let me focus on operating expenses and a few of the below-the-line expenses. ","Operating expenses in the quarter did include the benefit of a reversing a net deferred liability resulting from an organizational restructuring, and as we previously reported during our first quarter call, the net benefit results from the reversal of our profit sharing liability and represents a one-time credit of $43 million, which is net of transaction costs.  On an adjusted basis, year-over-year operating expenses were essentially flat, and I\u2019ll provide you with more color on that in the next few slides.","Interest expense declined to 25.3 million or a reduction of 22% year-over-year, and since our peak annual interest expense back in 2009 we have been able to reduce interest by approximately $74 million, a more than 40% reduction.  We did experience a $3.5 million foreign exchange loss during the quarter as a result of the peso deterioration.  The FX rate was 12.8 at March 31 and closed the second quarter on June 30 at 13.7.  ","We incurred a $5.9 million charge for debt retirement costs which relate to the refinancing of our 8% notes, and as a reminder, the annual interest expense savings from that refinancing we expect to be about $17 million, and we should exit 2012 with interest expense of about $100 million.  ","Income tax was 53.1 million in the quarter for an effective rate of about 31%, and I\u2019ll explain our lower than expected tax rate in more detail in a few slides.  Reported EPS was $1.09, and that does include the one-time deferred liability reversal of 43 million and a $5 million debt retirement charge; so on an adjusted basis, our EPS was $0.85, which was an increase of over 20% over a year ago.","On Slide 30, you can see our total adjusted operating expenses were essentially flat year-over-year.  Our volume-sensitive costs such as crew labor, fuel and car hire were up about 6 million.  Fuel price increased 3 million year-over-year, and inflation increased our costs by approximately 6 million, and then we did benefit by 14 million from the decline in the peso.  And as Pat already mentioned in his materials, revenue declined by 15 million so we essentially had minimal impact to operating income due to foreign currency fluctuations.","On the chart on the last equipment expenses, we\u2019re down 3 million year-over-year and that\u2019s due to the locomotive lease that we acquired.  We acquired those assets back in the third quarter of 2011, and that has contributed to about a 50 basis point improvement in our operating ratio.  Purchased services increased 5.5 million largely due to volume-related increases in our intermodal business and the timing of track maintenance related expenditures.  I\u2019ll cover comp and benefits and fuel on the next two pages.","So turning to Page 31, comp and benefits expense increased slightly year-over-year to 106 million, and as you can see on the chart on the left-hand side of the table, headcount declined during the quarter, demonstrating again that our operations team continues to do a great job managing our cost structure.  Incentives and other went up 3 million, and we did experience a $4 million benefit due to foreign currency.  Just to give you a little perspective on full-year, we do expect our total comp and benefits to be up only 2% over 2011 despite volume increases and inflationary cost pressures.  ","Turning to Slide 32, from a fuel perspective, fuel did decline 5 million year-over-year largely due to foreign currency.  While our reported price per gallon, as you can see on the left-hand side of the slide, declined to $2.78, the FX adjusted price was actually 2.97.  During the quarter, our lag benefit due to the falling diesel prices was approximately $2.5 million, and while our carloadings were actually up 4% year-over-year, our fuel consumption actually declined due to the commodity mix issue that Pat discussed earlier.  For those of you keeping track of gallons and prices during the quarter, in Mexico we consumed 15.7 million gallons at an average price of $2.49, and in the U.S. 15.5 million gallons at $3.08.","So now let me on Pages 33 and 34 cover our taxes in a little bit more detail.  On Page 33, this chart reconciles our U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% to our effective rate of 30.5 for the quarter.  Our effective tax rate for 2Q of 30.5 was lower than originally projected and is the result of two discreet items \u2013 the changing FX rate and a tax valuation allowance credit we recorded during the quarter.  Let me walk you through the chart from left to right and explain how we ended up with a lower tax rate.  ","First, state taxes and other increased our tax rate by 3.8% - that\u2019s on top of the 35% federal statutory rate.  Second, as you know, the FX rate has improved from 14 at the end of 2011 to now a projected 13.5 for the end of 2012.  Again, based on Mexican tax law, when the peso strengthens it theoretically requires fewer pesos to extinguish our U.S. dollar denominated debt that we have in Mexico, and that creates an unrealized income and a resulting non-cash tax expense, and in this case specifically adding 3 percentage points to our tax rate.  As a reminder, our general rule of thumb is that a 10 basis point change in the exchange rate equates to about a 50 basis point change in our tax rate, so you can see the roughly 3 percentage point increase to the statutory rate.  ","Next, GAAP also requires us to true up taxes for the first quarter since we booked a rate in the low 40s, and we now expect our full-year tax rate to be somewhere in the 36 to 38% range.  So this changing tax rate estimate is fully explained by the improving peso since first quarter, and we booked a credit that reduced our rate by 2.4%.  ","Next, the statutory rate in Mexico that we pay taxes on is only 31%, so below the U.S. rate; and based on our pre-tax income mix, this had the impact of reducing our consolidated tax rate by 3.3%.  And finally, we reversed a $9.8 million tax valuation allowance representing state tax expense that we had recorded in prior periods.  This valuation allowance was related to state NOLs that now have more certainty of being utilized since we have a clear history of using these NOLs over the past few years, and we also have more certainty in utilizing the NOLs going forward, and the $9.8 million reduction to tax expense does represent real economic value to us.","Turning to Slide 34 to provide some additional color on the volatility of the peso and the impact to our tax rate, I wanted to highlight how the deterioration in the exchange rate drives the effective rate down and vice versa.  Hopefully, you can see in this chart the peso was relatively stable prior to fourth quarter 2008, as was the resulting effective tax rate.  So on the green line, you can see the peso began to deteriorate, driving down our effective rate depicted by the blue line as Mexican tax law again provides the deduction relative to our U.S. dollar denominated liabilities.  You can continue to see this inverse relationship of FX and tax rates since the end of \u201908, in some cases driving our tax rate up and in some cases driving our tax rate down.  But of particular importance if you look at the table that we have in the slide on the bottom right, you can see our expectation over a five-year period, while there is some volatility in each year, that the net of that has been about a $1 million tax expense and it\u2019s largely been non-cash.  ","We will continue to evaluate the risks and benefits of attempting to hedge currency, but we haven\u2019t made that decision at this stage and we\u2019ll likely evaluate that as we become a cash taxpayer.","Finally on Slide 35, we did generate 57 million of free cash flow year-to-date.  As we\u2019ve communicated in the past, our priorities for cash have generally been to de-lever the balance sheet, invest in our business, and provide for shareholder return.  Having largely completed our deleveraging and debt restructuring goals by calling the 8% notes in June, our focus will begin to shift on investing in our growth opportunities and providing for returns to our shareholders.  ","You can see we\u2019ve significantly reduced our interest expense through a combination of debt reduction and refinancing activity, and we believe we fully have credit metrics that meet the criteria of an investment-grade company.  While our core CAPEX spending continues to suggest a CAPEX to revenue ratio of 17 to 18%, we\u2019re fully committed to continuing to invest in our business to achieve a superior growth profile, and accordingly we do expect to take delivery of some incremental locomotives by the end of the year which should add somewhere between 2 to 3% to our CAPEX to revenue ratio.  It\u2019s also important to note that that would allow us to take advantage of the 50% bonus depreciation rules that are in effect through the end of this year.","Also during the quarter, we continued to evolve our strategy of acquiring assets under lease and turning those to ownership, and we\u2019ll continue to do that and the total outlays during the quarter were 20.  Some of the commitments we made will take that to $23 million.","And then finally, our Board of Directors approved the Company\u2019s second quarter dividend which was paid on July 6.  Our yield continues to be slightly above 1%, and that\u2019s a level that we are comfortable with at this point.","So with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Dave.","David Starling","Thanks, Mike.  If you\u2019ll turn to Slide 37, I\u2019ll talk about Panama Canal Railway (inaudible).  There were some labor issues at the Pacific port in Panama.  There was a strike.  It was resolved, and then there were a few days of strike again.  That\u2019s now been resolved, but it did affect volumes and create congestion in the port, which we are currently sorting out.  Our run rate is already improving in this quarter.  As you can see, it caused a slight deterioration in the operating ratio down to the low 50s \u2013 still, not a bad performance.","In the closing remarks, I\u2019d like to end with just a couple of comments about our immediate and long-term future.  While we don\u2019t profess to have any special ability to predict the economy, it feels to us that the second half of 2012 will be okay.  There is certainly a fairly high degree of uncertainty out there, and while the majority of our customers think they\u2019ll experience some level of growth in the back half, everyone is being very cautious.  Though hardly a valid sample size, our carloadings through the first few days of July would suggest our customers are correct and that business will be okay.  ","It certainly appears that the worst may be over this year as Pat spoke about coal.  Of course, right now with the blistering heat in our region, the coal burns are quite good.  We\u2019re going to have to wait to see where natural gas prices are later in the year when temperatures moderate.  Currently, natural gas pricing is moving toward a level which would make PRB coal price competitive, but we\u2019ll have to see how that market develops over the next few months.  The rest of our commodity groups look like they\u2019ll be fine, and in some cases like intermodal and automotive they\u2019ll be more than fine.","In terms of revenue guidance, two things which are beyond our control could continue to exert influence over revenues.  The peso-dollar exchange rate could either help or hurt revenues.  In the second quarter, FX exerted downward pressure, but we\u2019ll just have to wait to see what happens during the rest of the year.  Also fuel expenses have definitely moderated \u2013 that\u2019s a good thing for us, but it certainly appears that you won\u2019t see as much fuel surcharge revenue in our numbers.  As Pat and Mike both mentioned, it is important to remember that while both FX and fuel surcharge can impact our top line, they do not have a corresponding impact on our profitability.  In terms of FX, we have a good natural hedge that, for the most part, neutralizes the impact of currency fluctuations.  In terms of lower fuel costs, while it may lessen the revenue number, we will benefit from the lesser expense.  ","In the end, while we believe our second half volumes will remain steady or may even improve, the impact of the second quarter lower than anticipated coal volumes and the possible future impacts of foreign exchange and lower fuel prices will likely lead to our 2012 revenue percentage increase, as Pat stated, to fall into the mid-single digits.  However, no matter what the impact of these items on the revenue line, barring any kind of significant event, we believe we can continue to improve our operating ratio and overall profitability during the second half.","Our final word about the future \u2013 we feel that 2012 will be a very good year for KCS.  The first half was good and we feel the second half has the potential to be even better.  We have always looked at 2012 as a bridge year.  Developments in nearly all of our commodity segments suggest that growth could and should accelerate in 2013 and 2014 as new auto and steel plants come online, our new energy opportunities are realized, and our intermodal business continues to expand and mature.  To sum it up, we at KCS feel very, very good about our future.","And with that, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  We will now be conducting a question and answer session.  [Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney.  Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, hi there.  Good morning.  You know Dave or perhaps Mike, just a couple of questions around some of the labor stuff.  We have the new labor deal.  I thought it was going to have a bigger impact on the P&L, the way we view the labor expense, but maybe I didn\u2019t understand that.  And within that, can you talk a little bit about maybe the productivity because, Dave, I think you mentioned the industry-leading productivity, but how much better can that get?  What annual were in you in there?","Michael Upchurch","Dave, do you want to start with the productivity?","David Ebbrecht","Sure.  On the productivity side, our headcount controls will continue to be flat, and we still have a lot of latent capacity within our train network, especially in Mexico, to grow within our current structure.  So I don\u2019t see any degradation at all in the productivity, and we\u2019ll continue to see modest gains as our growth continues.","Michael Upchurch","And Bill, this is Mike.  With respect to what you may have had in your models for second quarter, I think it\u2019s remarkable we kept our overall comp and benefits expense pretty flat on a year-over-year basis, and the guidance I gave for the full year is that our comp and benefits would only be up 2% and that has to cover certainly volume increases and inflationary cost pressures.  But I think a combination of the efficiency that Dave talked about some of the reductions in our overall incentive-related expenses that we\u2019ve already covered really help.  And keep in mind that we took the credit all in a single line item, so it didn\u2019t all run through comp and benefits.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, okay, got it.  And then Dave Starling, your last comments just about your forward outlook, when you\u2019re referring to growth, were these comments largely focused on volume or was that sort of an earnings comment?  I just want to make sure we interpret what you\u2019re trying to say there correctly.","David Starling","Well if Pat does his job properly, we better have the revenue with the growth!  No, I mean, when you get into the automotive industry and the growth in the intermodal, we certainly see volume growth, but with that, good revenue growth will go with it.  And I think our ability to continue to leverage the network and the efficiencies we have are going to still make that bottom line look even better.  I mean, we\u2019re still able to onboard more volume at a very good margin.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","The incremental should keep these sort of levels we\u2019ve seen, in other words?","David Starling","They should.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.  All right, thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.  Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","Hey, thanks.  Good morning.  Maybe just a question on the cross-border intermodal.  I think you mentioned that it\u2019s up 5X from the opening of the Victoria Rosenberg extension there.  I guess I just wanted to get a sense, first of all, kind of what you think the potential capacity is \u2013 you\u2019re expanding your reach further into the U.S. \u2013 as far as incremental volume growth as we go forward.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","","Chris, this is Pat.  Your question is what capacity issues do we expect to have?","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","Do you have capacity issues going forward, or what is the level of capacity you might have for further growth?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","We\u2019ve got a lot of capacity in terms of space on the trains we are running today.  One of the things we\u2019ll have to do as we continue to extend our reach and increase the volumes over our gateways is add service, but we try to really stay ahead of that both in terms of terminal capacity, network capacity.  You know, look three or four years out \u2013 you\u2019re familiar with some of the investments we\u2019ve made in the terminals in Mexico.  That\u2019s all with an eye toward looking at our volume projections and the increases, and staying well ahead of any potential bottlenecks, whether it\u2019s locomotive, whether it\u2019s line capacity, whether it\u2019s terminal capacity, chassis\u2019.  You know, there are a lot of things that could provide bottlenecks, and we try very hard to understand where are all those are and make sure that we\u2019re ahead of them as we bring the volume on.","David Starling","","Chris, this is Dave Starling.  Let me give you just a couple of examples.  We talked about how we model the capacity and continue to expand.  We\u2019re already pulling our 2013 expansion at the Monterey facility into 2012 because of the volume growth.  We are in the second year of laying 136-pound welded rail between Laredo and Monterey \u2013 that\u2019s a four-year project.  We can accelerate it if we need to, but that will give us a 79 mile-an-hour railroad between Monterey and Laredo, so we are very consciously continuing to expand.  Our commitment to Pat is, it\u2019s there, fill it, we\u2019re not going to restrict it.  So we\u2019ll continue to spend the money necessary and have the focus on that corridor to make sure we can handle the growth, because a lot of that growth, the automotive growth, will be in that same corridor.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.  And so it sounds like that has the potential to lend itself to existing train starts, at least for the time being, so that the space is available on the existing trains that you\u2019re running as opposed to incremental train starts for the most part?","David Starling","Pat has more space to fill.  ","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, fair enough.  And then one quick question on the auto side \u2013 you just mentioned about the fact that most of that is currently running kind of on the Mexico specific side of the network.  I guess what are the barriers to extending that into the U.S. and really doing it on a cross-border basis?  Is it just waiting for existing contracts to kind of renew, or is there anything else to think about there as far as allowing that business to flow across the border more freely?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","The primary gating factor is contracts.  I mean, it is\u2014the bulk of that business is under contract.  Obviously when we look at the three new plants or four new plants that are being built, there are no contracts; so in that case, it\u2019s a matter of getting those plants up and running and producing.  That cross-border business will be available to us when those plants open, but a lot of the automotive business is locked up under contract and another piece of it is just continuing to improve the service options and getting the service together to get to the markets that we need to serve beyond just the KCS network.","But the shortest answer and the best answer, really, is that business is locked up under contract, in some cases out to 2017.  ","David Starling","","And in some cases, some if it is actually up for bid as we speak.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Correct.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","All right, so it\u2019s a rolling process.","David Starling","That\u2019s right.","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","Great.  Thanks for the time, guys.  I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Great, good morning.  Just trying to dig into your decreased revenue outlook a bit.  Can you walk though\u2014are the utility customers now accepting coal again?  Is that issue\u2014you know, the two plants that had stopped for a while, can you walk us through an update on that?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes.  Every utility we serve is now taking coal.  Some of them still have very high stockpiles in spite of the fact that the heat is really causing the plants to all run at pretty high levels.  But every one of our plants is now taking coal; and again, at the risk of being wrong twice, I\u2019m just telling you exactly what we\u2019re hearing from our customers, and what we\u2019re hearing is that they expect\u2014probably the best chart in the deck, in my opinion, is the one that shows the average daily carloading for the coal business.  You can see how far that fell off in March, April and May, and where it\u2019s come back to.  And what we are hearing is that the expectation is that we will be in that sort of high 600, low 700, the range that you see in June and July for the rest of the year.","David Starling","I might add, too, that we have one coal customer that their contract will be up for renewal at the first of the year, so they\u2019re expecting a rate increase and we expect them to have as much coal delivered as they can possibly stand between now and the end of the year.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Okay.  And then can you talk a bit about yields, kind of the optics of mix shifts that you experienced through the quarter with the growth of intermodal autos.  You know, compare that will what you expect on the underlying\u2014you know, just again trying to dig into this decreased revenue outlook.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Ken, really I\u2019ve said it, and if you look at the two slides \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to oversimplify it, but the decreased revenue outlook for the year is a function of the energy business.  Every single business unit, if you go back to the first quarter presentation that we gave you, every single business unit other than energy, the outlook is exactly the same as it was at the end of the first quarter.  Obviously the peso has an impact, and fuel; but as far as the core business, the only one that has changed from what the guidance we gave in the first quarter is energy.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","So Pat, on that, are there corresponding costs that you can pull out as well, or is it moving equipment around that?  How can you\u2014","Patrick Ottensmeyer","That\u2019s the other thing, and I guess going back to\u2014before I forget.  I mean, you saw revenue per unit decline.  We\u2019ve kind of been saying this for the last couple of years that you might see some odd things happening in our revenue per unit as our intermodal business grows.  And you understand, the RPU for the intermodal is different that it is particularly for coal, where what you saw happening in the second quarter was a huge kind of flip between coal and intermodal which drove the outcome in the RPU.  We don\u2019t think of revenue per unit as yield.  You guys talk about it as yield \u2013 we really don\u2019t think of it as yield because of the way the mix is going to change that.  So we\u2019re getting increased yields in intermodal as we add more containers to the train.  That basically falls almost 100% to the bottom line, so as we build density and we build capacity on those intermodal trains, the profitability impact is going to be very positive.","On the coal side, again, to see the kind of drop-off we saw in the coal business during the quarter and still show the kind of operating ratio improvement, and we\u2019ve also talked about this \u2013 as you know, how the coal business runs, it\u2019s all unit trains and the equipment in our case is\u2014100% of the equipment is privately owned, so we don\u2019t pay that cost.  When we have the kind of reduction that we had in the coal business, unlike general merchandise or even intermodal, we have an immediate cost avoidance in terms of fuel, crews, locomotives, everything else, so the scaling that Dave Ebbrecht talked about in terms of the lost coal business is probably better and more immediate than it is in any other business unit.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Very helpful.  ","Michael Upchurch","And Ken, again \u2013 this is Mike Upchurch.  Just to make one additional comment, despite the challenges in volume and on the coal side of the business, we improved our operating ratio on a year-over-year basis and sequential basis.  That should tell you something about the ability to manage the costs.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Certainly.  Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Crissey with UBS.  Please proceed with your question.  Kevin Crissey with UBS, your line is live.","I\u2019m sorry.  Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.  Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thank you very much, and thank you for clarifying the tax differences with the peso so clearly.  Wanted to ask two different questions.  The first is we\u2019ve had record heat in a lot of your service regions.  How does excessive heat affect your ability to operate?","David Ebbrecht","Well the excessive heat, first of all, creates some conditions on the track with the rail temperature that we do have to monitor and we have to patrol ahead of some trains in some instances where we have to take precautionary measures.  Other than that, the excessive heat does not pose immediate threat as far as just pure train operations, other than from a safety aspect of keeping the crews hydrated and making sure that we are conducting a consistent and safe operation.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne Agee","So maybe run slightly lighter, slightly slower?","David Ebbrecht","Well, we do have heat orders where the track heats up, then we will place heat orders on those when the rail temperature\u2019s in a certain range, until we can verify the track is stable.  And when it stays above that temperature, we\u2019re able to take those off; but we do go through a transitional period where we do have to run slower, especially down on our Laredo sub and sort of our hotter areas during that transition period.","David Starling","","This is Dave answer.  I think one answer would be if you look at our service metrics today, you have not seen a deterioration, even with the consistent high heat.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne Agee","No, that\u2019s what I was referring to.  I\u2019m a little surprised by that, but that\u2019s great.  A second quick follow-up is grain.  You know, with the corn crop at 31%, I think you alluded to looking okay but let\u2019s watch this for the second half.  What percentage of your grain business is cross-border today?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Oh, I have that handy here.  It\u2019s a large portion of our business.  It\u2019s probably in the high 40% range, close to 50%.  That\u2019s by far the biggest segment of our cross-border traffic today is grain.","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.  And if for whatever reason the yields are poor\u2014I mean, high corn prices are great for the farmer, but that\u2019s going to be bad for volume later this year.  Is the volume more at risk going to be the chickens in Arkansas or is it going to be more the cross-border grain moving down to Mexico?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s a different risk factor in either of those, but the thing we kind of believe about our grain business is because so much of it is based on human consumption, people will still want to eat and chickens will need to be fed, that what might happen even if prices are on the rise, that we have to draw from a broader region.  But our end consumers will still need the grain, and we think that gives us a little more stability in our business than might otherwise be the case if we were selling into the world market and the prices would push that U.S. grain out of the market.  ","Jeff Kauffman \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay, well thank you and congratulations.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets.  Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Hey, I want to follow back up on Jeff\u2019s line of question around grain.  Am I thinking about it right, if grain was to be weaker in the back half than expected because the crop yields come in light, is it similar to your coal franchise in that a lot of this stuff runs in unit trains, and if the volumes were to come in lighter, you could more aggressively attack the cost structure around that than if it was weakness in your general merchandise business?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes.  I mean, all of our cross-border gain moves in shuttle service, which is very similar to the coal business.  The only main difference would be the equipment cost, the car costs.  We own a large percentage of our grain cars, which is different than the coal business, so our cost avoidance would not be exactly the same, but fuel, crew, locomotives \u2013 all of that, we would stop immediately.","John Barnes \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, very good.  And then going back to your comment around capital expenditures, I think you highlighted that you expected to still run at a similar pace or percentage of revenue that you\u2019ve seen in the last several quarters.  I\u2019m just kind of curious as to is there a cliff that you\u2019re finally getting to, or are you getting closer to maybe completing a lot of the projects that would have kept that elevated, and what we\u2019re seeing now is that number still is up there because you are pulling forward?  What I\u2019m asking is, are we getting to a point where maybe that begins to ramp down by a couple of percentage points and we start to see more free cash flow generation?","David Starling","That\u2019s a CEO question \u2013 I\u2019ll take that one.  You know, we are long-term players.  We\u2019ve been in this business 125 years, and we owe it to our customers to have a good railroad.  We owe it to our customers to have plenty of capacity for their expansion, and with the growth story that we see for our railroad in 2013 and 2014, the worst crime we could commit for a shareholder or our customers is not have the capacity to handle it.  So I do not see us backing off of our 17 or 18%.  We\u2019ll continue to have the 10 to 11 for maintenance, but I think capacity expansion with our growth story is always going to be forefront in my mind of making sure that we have the capacity to grow.","Michael Upchurch","Hey John, this is Mike Upchurch.  I know you made a mention on free cash flow and generating more free cash flow.  I might just make one clarifying comment there \u2013 while we reported 57 million for the year, and you may be looking at our investor report and see 92 there a year ago, I think it is important to understand that we initiated dividends this year, which we didn\u2019t have last year, so that may have negatively impacted some comps.  We also did a $23 million lease buy-out, and then a year ago of the 92 million, we had 30 million related to insurance recoveries sitting in there.  So when you kind of look at it on a run rate basis, we\u2019re really over 100 million year-to-date and about 60 a year ago, so that\u2019s a pretty substantial increase in free cash flow.","John Barnes \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","All right.  Thanks for the clarification there.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","To go back to specify the answer to the question on cross-border, it is 48% of our total ag and mineral line haul revenue cross-border.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo Advisors.  Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","Thank you.  Good morning.  First, a housekeeping question, a bigger picture question.  Mike, what was the effective tax rate that you used in the $0.85 adjusted EPS number?","Michael Upchurch","We used the statutory rate there.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","Which was what?","Michael Upchurch","About 38% or so on, you know, combined state and fed.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","Perfect, thank you.  And then a bigger picture question here, and I appreciate the encouraging comments you gave with respect to all the organic growth opportunities, which we certainly buy into, and the encouragement that you find in your customer discussions about a decent second half.  But can you just remind us the two or three things that you watch internally and how quickly you can make adjustments to the extent that the macro picture deteriorates from here?  Thank you.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I would say the most important thing we look at\u2014you know, obviously in the coal and grain business, we kind of talked about that, and we get pretty good visibility from our customers what to expect.  But I think the most important thing is feedback from customers, and we really try to keep our fingers on the pulse and actively engage in dialogue and outlook.  When we do our forecasting and projections, we do it based on customer-specific.  The top 200 customers in U.S. and Mexico represent over 80% of our total revenues, and we build our forecasts and our projections on customer-specific input for each of those.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","And then the adjustments that you can make and how quickly you can make those?","David Starling","Well, this is Dave Starling, and I\u2019ll let Dave Ebbrecht speak to this as well.  I think if you sat through our morning call and listened to the 80 people that are on the call in the U.S. and the second call at 8:30 in the morning, we\u2019re in a very unique business.  We know what our loadings were through yesterday.  We know our customer orders.  We know how many cars are stored.  We know the turn times, the availabilities; so I\u2019ve got to give Dave Ebbrecht and his team great credit.  I mean, they are on top of it every day, and those decisions on whether to furlough crews, to put locomotives in what we call surge storage to start to adjust our costs can happen very quickly.","David Ebbrecht","Yeah, and I\u2019ll just add when we look at 48 hours out, 72 hours out, that\u2019s how we adjust very quickly and nimbly to changes in demand, and then we look at some synergies that we can get to extend those changes and make sure that we have cost savings that go well beyond just a short term and extend through the rest of the quarter.","David Starling","The paper mills, for instance \u2013 we know when their maintenance shutdowns are going to be from a week-to-week basis.  We know if they delay one, if the orders are great.  We know if they pull it forward, or they\u2019ve either got a machine problem or their orders have dropped.  It\u2019s really a pretty unique business in knowing what our customers are doing and the forecasting.  If they don\u2019t order the cars, if they don\u2019t provide us the forecast, we may short them cars; so we get great information from our customers.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","That\u2019s really helpful.  Thank you, gentlemen.","Michael Upchurch","Anthony, Mike Upchurch.  Let me clarify that comment on the tax rate.  Even though I just told you in the slide that the statutory rate in Mexico is lower than the U.S., I answered that with a U.S. statutory rate so you should look at a 30% rate.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","Oh, it was 30%?","Michael Upchurch","Yeah, yeah.  I apologize for that.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","That\u2019s important.  Thanks, Mike.","","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JP Morgan Chase.  Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan","Yeah, good morning.  I think the first one I have is a question for Dave.  You commented before we got into the Q&A about 2012 is a bridge year and 2013 and 2014, you would expect stronger revenue growth, and I think Pat gave more detail on some of the drivers behind that.  How would we think about three utility coal and FX impact?  I think you were saying, you know, like 10, 12% of revenue growth this year.  How do you think about the range that you get to when you\u2019re beyond this bridge year?  Is it 15% revenue growth, or what\u2014you know, based on the information you have, is there any kind of range you can put us in for 2013, 2014?","David Starling","I\u2019ll take a shot at that and then hand it over to the marketing guru here.  We are spending a lot of time right now with the three customers in Mexico that have already committed to building auto plants \u2013 some are already under construction.  I think it\u2019s a moving picture right now.  Some of the customers, some of the plants will service the U.S. and Canada.  Some will actually go both directions \u2013 they\u2019ll actually export through Lazaro to Central and South America.  I mean, Mexico is a very unique geographic location that can serve markets in both directions, and then there\u2019s also that growing middle class in Mexico itself.  So that is a real tough question for us.  I mean, Pat\u2019s trying to quantify it, trying to put those numbers together.  The operating guys definitely want them so we can still plan our capacity correctly, but I would say it\u2019s still kind of a moving target.  I know Pat\u2019s done some work on trying to quantify the associated products that we enjoy as a result of manufacturing an automobile, and I know he\u2019s taken a shot at it but we have not made it a science yet.  I\u2019m not sure we ever will.","Pat, you want to take a shot from there?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","The only thing I\u2019d say, Tom, is what we\u2019re trying to convey here is really that the outlook is very good for continued new business opportunities and new business growth for us, given our unique position and competitive advantage in Mexico.  We haven\u2019t quantified beyond this year.  We\u2019re really in the early stages of our planning and forecasting for 2013 and beyond.  We\u2019re trying to get more precise information, as Dave mentioned, from the auto companies, so we\u2019re at the beginning of that process.  At this point, I don\u2019t think we are prepared to quantify what that growth rate range is, but the overall sort of big picture is that it looks very good.","David Starling","Yeah, I\u2019ll add a couple more comments.  We had breakfast with the CEO of Ternium in Mexico a couple of weeks ago, and the new plant that\u2019s going to be built in Monterey, I think it\u2019s over a billion dollars they\u2019re spending in this plant.  And I didn\u2019t realize how much of the U.S. market that plant will serve.  We just kind of assumed it was going to be for Mexico auto manufacturing and the growth of manufacturing in Mexico, but they clearly see the U.S. and Canada.  It\u2019s already a market for them.  In fact, they actually have distribution centers in a couple of places in the U.S. already.  But they clearly see themselves providing product going into the U.S. and Canada.  And then we\u2019ve got chemical plants that are going to be built on our system in the U.S.  Railroads would get excited about an automobile being built on their system every couple of years, every five years.  We\u2019re going to have four in two years, so this is pretty dynamic.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, great.  That\u2019s helpful.  One more question along that theme \u2013 Pat, you gave us some helpful detail here on the steel plants.  It looks like these are relatively near term in terms of end of \u201912 and into 2013.  Is there a framework for\u2014you know, you\u2019re saying 3.5 million tons of added steel.  How much steel runs on your line today, or how many carloads?  Because I don\u2019t feel like I have a good feeling for what the base is when we consider the 3.5 million tons.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yeah, I\u2019d like to kind of hold off on giving any more specific guidance, again, as Dave mentioned, until we get a better handle on what these customers are expecting in terms of volumes and rail market share and routings and everything else to give maybe in the future some better guidance about what we think is going to do in terms of our own growth outlook.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan ","Okay, fair enough.  ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","And the other thing I\u2019ll mention \u2013 some of these are mills, and some of these are processing centers so that\u2019s important.  As you look at the details on the slide, the Di Acero, Ternium and Steel Technologies in the north are new mills, and these are huge facilities.  As Dave mentioned, each one of them is over a billion dollars of investment for the producer.  Some of the others are processing centers.  They will generate freight.  You\u2019ll have a coil going to a processing center to be stamped into an auto part and then moved to the plant, so we\u2019re still trying to sort out exactly what this means in terms of our own outlook for volume and revenue.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JP Morgan ","Okay, great.  Yeah, I appreciate it.  Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan & Company.  Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Hey, good morning guys.  How\u2019s it going?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good.  How you doing, Scott?","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Good.  So wanted to ask a question on coal.  Pat, when you talk with your utility customers, what\u2019s the gas price that you think you need in order to see some more switching back to coal?  And then what\u2019s the explanation you\u2019re getting from your customers on why we\u2019re going to see this continued strong run rate that we\u2019re seeing in June and July, and why it won\u2019t drop off again in the fall when we get to the shoulder months?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Well, if you look at the run rate, I mentioned high 600, low 700s, right around there.  You know, that\u2019s greatly improved from the spring but it\u2019s still below the shoulder month last year.  Just to go back and tick off your questions, what we\u2019re hearing\u2014and it\u2019s different plant by plant, but what we\u2019re hearing is gas prices kind of in the 3.50 and higher, our coal plants and our coal business will do pretty well.  We\u2019re below that now.  Right now, everything is firing because of the intense heat, and everyone is taking coal; so when the temperatures moderate, if gas prices are where they are, we might see some drop-off at a couple of plants.  ","David Starling","And regulated and deregulated makes a big difference as well.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yeah \u2013 it makes a difference by market, by plants.  The cost structure of the plants are different.  What else was I going to say?  Lost my train of thought.  ","So I think the levels we\u2019re at now, while they are improved from the spring, still below last year.  We have some other things \u2013 Dave mentioned the fact that one of the coal moves that we\u2019re in is going to be\u2014it\u2019s a joint line move with another western carrier.  Our rates are set, and to provide a little bit more clarification to the point Dave made, our rates are set for this move going forward but the originating carrier bringing the coal to Kansas City, that contract is up for a renewal at the end of this year, and they are expecting the rates will increase and they are building a stockpile to the sky in anticipation of those rates increasing.  So we\u2019re seeing some unusually heavy movement for the rest of the year as they build their stockpile in anticipation of a rate increase.","We won\u2019t see that rate increase because this is what\u2019s called a Rule 11 rate, where the rate for the two railroads are set separately directly to the customer.  Our contract is not going to be affected, but the overall cost to the utility will be.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, that\u2019s great color.  Thanks.  And then the second question on Lazaro, can you talk about the timing for the new concession opening up, and then what percent of the current concessions are being utilized?  Is there need for the second concession yet where we see kind of an immediate volume benefit, and then maybe longer term, how does the opening of Panama Canal impact Lazaro and then the company overall?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay.  Second concession was awarded in December, and as we understand it, all of the paperwork and the contracts and the agreements were signed in June.  The concession was awarded to APM Terminals, which is an affiliate of Maersk Lines.  The current concession, there\u2019s only one concession operating at Lazaro today, and that\u2019s Hutchinson.  Hutchinson is running probably about\u2014it\u2019s a moving target, because they\u2019re running about 65, 70% of capacity, but they\u2019ve got a footprint and they are continuing to increase capacity.  They\u2019re adding paving, they added a new berthing crane earlier this year, so they are in the process of taking their capacity to roughly 1.5 million.  They think the footprint that they have and the design that they have will allow them to build to about 2.2 million, so that capacity is going to continue to increase at Hutchinson.","We met with APM earlier this year.  They have an exact\u2014the exact same footprint in terms of the size of the property as Hutchinson has, but they are going to design it differently and they think they can get capacity to something like 2.5 to 3 million once they are fully built out.  It\u2019s going to take years to get to that level, obviously.  What we would expect, and Dave knows the lay of the land better than I do in terms of the way this rolls out generally, but we would expect that initially some of APM\u2019s growth will come out of Hutchinson but that over time both of them will grow.  I guess the important thing is we\u2019re serving a port that has been the fastest growing container terminal in North America the last couple of years, and it\u2019s going to go from something around 1.2 million TEUs today, and the capacity is on the board to go to 4.5 to 5 but that\u2019s going to take several years.  The good news is we are maintaining our market share at Lazaro in the 65 to 70% range versus truck, and as you know, we\u2019re the only railroad that gets there.","David Starling","I\u2019ll add to Pat\u2019s comment \u2013 generally what happens when you open a second port concession is there is a deterioration in the rates.  You now have a competitor, so the rates will be more competitive\u2014or the ocean carrier, not our rate.  So the ocean carriers will have a little bit of leverage then because they have a two-port opportunity, and the company that may lose on that would be the Manzanillo International Terminal, that is the older facility.  This will give the ocean carriers a little bit of chance to leverage into the new concession and get out of Manzanillo.","The question on Panama, we get this frequently.  The opening of the Canal should cause the pie to get bigger in Panama.  You can bring in bigger ships.  That\u2019s more opportunity for trans-shipment.  We are a cost avoidance model in Panama, and I think recently when they had the labor problems there, it created some congestion; and the ports right now are\u2014there is a lot of growth in Panama, and they are realizing that they need more space and that they need more berths.  So the government in Panama is now working on a U.S. model of adding another port on the Pacific side called Corazel, which is adjacent to our railroad.  That could be a new modern facility that would be added to the Hutchinson facility.  And at the same time, the ports on the Atlantic side, there is a new concession being discussed \u2013 I forget the name of it \u2013 but it\u2019s east of the Evergreen facility by a couple of companies.  They\u2019ve come to us for service, so there\u2019s still more growth that\u2019s going to occur in Panama because of the third set of locks \u2013 again, just more ships, bigger ships, more opportunity for trans-shipment.","On Lazaro Carde\u00f1as, the effect on a canal with Lazaro, it\u2019s a different market.  Generally all you will see on the ships that in that deployment is maybe a stop in Panama to load or unload, but generally that allocation coming out of Asia and Mexico is for that market. We\u2019re starting to get some inquiries as well, more inquiries that we\u2019ve had in the past about the U.S. market.  I think some of it could be related to the noise on the east coast about the potential strike, so we\u2019re getting some inquiries for cross-border.  ","Scott Group \u2013Wolfe Trahan & Co.","All right, that\u2019s great color.  Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James Financial.  Please proceed with your question.","Tyler Brown \u2013 Raymond James","Hey, good morning guys.  I\u2019ve got just a couple quick cash flow questions.  Mike, I know you\u2019ve gone over this in the past, but can you refresh us on your cash tax paying status, both in U.S. and Mexico, given the NOL revaluations?  Does that lengthen the non-cash tax paying status?","Michael Upchurch","Yeah, it\u2019s a different answer in Mexico and in the U.S.  We are probably on a trend right now that by the end of the year, we could become a cash tax payer in Mexico, and then 2013 in the U.S.  So we will have utilized the majority of our NOLs.","Tyler Brown \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, perfect.  And then just to clarify on the CAPEX, so is the guidance 17 to 18, or is it 17 to 18 plus the 2 to 3 for the locomotive pull forward?  ","Michael Upchurch","It\u2019s plus the 2 to 3, so look at a number roughly 500 million.","Tyler Brown \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, perfect.  I\u2019ll just leave it at that.  Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.  Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks, good morning.  So I was wondering if your outlook for non-coal energy has changed in light of lower oil prices. It looks like the pace of growth in frac sands slowed a little bit in the second quarter relative to Q1, and I was wondering if maybe that was a sign that drilling activity might be slowing down.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","A bit, although what we\u2019re seeing is that the pace of activity in the two\u2014the Eagleford region and the Bakken region is still pretty high.  We\u2019ve seen more of a drop in activity in the Haynesville, for example, where there is a much higher percentage of dry gas versus oil.  But the outlook really hasn\u2019t changed.  Still feel that the growth there is going to be very strong for several years to come, and then the ripple effect I think we talked about in the first quarter of these chemical\u2014these ethane, polyethylene plants, that also looks very good.  Based on what we have heard on production values or production estimates for most of those plants, any one of those could produce rail volumes equal to or larger than a coal plant.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful.  And just following up on that question, you mentioned earlier that crude and frac didn\u2019t quite offset the decline in coal this quarter, so I was wondering if maybe you could speak or provide some color behind the relative profitability of crude and frac versus utility, and if you think that the expectation for continued growth there could offset the utility volume declines in the second half. ","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Sure.  All of those businesses are very attractive, high profit, high contribution business, and so the answer is we\u2019re not diluting any of our contribution or operating ratio or profitability by shifting from utility coal to frac and crude.  The second quarter\u2014if you look at the first quarter, the offset was almost even.  Utility coal was down and frac and crude were up by about the same amount.  Utility coal, as you saw in the presentation, was weaker in the second quarter.  We don\u2019t expect that to happen, so it\u2019s hard to know but I would expect maybe the offset would be closer to what we saw in the first quarter than what we saw in the second quarter going forward.","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.  Fantastic.  Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna Financial Advisors.  Please proceed with your question.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna","Yeah, I just wanted to touch on Mexico given the strategic significance to your network, specifically in light of the change in the administration.  If you could just maybe refresh us where your primary points of contact are, your stronger relationships, your dialogue with the outgoing administration, and where some of those relationships may change and what your engagement with the incoming group has been like so far.","David Starling","Jos\u00e9, if you\u2019re still on the call, would you like to take this question?","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya","Yes, Dave, of course.  The new administration \u2013 every six years when the administration changes, most of the top officials of the administration leaves the office.  The ones that are directly related to us is the SCT, equivalent to the transportation board in the U.S., and the secretary.  The new or the potential candidate to become the new secretaries of the SCT in Mexico are people we know and we have worked with them in the past five years, so we have a good and close relationship with most of them.  Of course, nothing is certain until they are named for that position.  And we have worked very\u2014as Dave mentioned the beginning of the call, we have been working with the new president for six years now when he was Governor of the State of Mexico, very close, and we are confident that he will continue the way he was as governor, promoting for investment and supporting private business.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay, so what I\u2019m hearing loud and clear is that the line of sight visibility into the people with whom you\u2019ll be dealing with, and also good working relationships which span years, ergo we should not expect any significant change.","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya","That\u2019s right, exactly.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna","Okay, thank you.  The second question I have \u2013 just more broadly as we think about rail property, (inaudible) coal domestically, you know, this is a property and what are, I think, in terms of expectations over time gravitate towards an OR in the mid-60 range over time.  Is that something that is still attainable in, let\u2019s call it a three to five-year time frame?  Do you not manage it that way, or just what\u2019s\u2014you know, when you think about the dart board on a multi-year planning basis, is that\u2019s something that\u2019s reasonable or within your goalposts?","David Starling","You know, I\u2019m going to take this one, make this statement I\u2019ve continued to make.  We\u2019re going to continue to grow our revenue and control our costs and improve our operating ratio on a year-to-year basis.  Certainly we\u2019ve said in the past, we want a six in front of the number.  We feel like we\u2019re headed in that direction, but we have not set any goals to say we\u2019re going to be at 65 by some year.  We\u2019re going to continue to work on it.  We don\u2019t see any major obstacles.  We set a goal before of 1.5 points every five years, and then we did\u2014or every year, and then we did 10 points over a five-year period.  So again, goals are good, but we\u2019re going to continue to run our business and make the right investments and the right decisions, and I think the operating ratio will demonstrate that.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna","Excellent.  Thanks for the detailed answers, guys.","Operator","Thank you.  We have time for one more question.  Our last question comes from the line of Brad Delco with Stephens Inc.  Please proceed with your question.","Brad Delco \u2013 Stephens Inc.","","Good morning gentlemen.  I\u2019ll make this quick.  I guess it\u2019s a question for you, Mike.  If you look at your equipment, locomotives, I know you guys have taken some equipment off lease.  How much more of that is available, or maybe asked another way, how much of the equipment you currently have is leased versus you own?","Michael Upchurch","Yeah, our ownership of equipment is in the low 20s.  We think that\u2019s too low; we\u2019d like to migrate that up over a period of years, but understand we have a lot of equipment under lease, long-term lease.  And as they come up, we do engage in discussions with the lessors to try to attempt to buy that equipment to the extent we think we\u2019ve got a use for that equipment for a number of years.  And then certainly anything new, we\u2019ve had a bias towards trying to purchase either through a financing or with cash and own the asset.  I think you\u2019ll see us continue to do that and chip away at maybe what\u2019s a slight disadvantage today from an operating ratio perspective compared to the other railroads.  ","David Starling","I think, Brad, if you look at our goals that we have set over the years, it\u2019s certainly to become investment grade.  It\u2019s to push our maturities out at a lower interest rate and also in that list is a conversion from lease to own.  We\u2019re at 20%, as Mike said; the other railroads are about 50%, so we certainly are making decisions now that when the cash is available, rather than lease we\u2019re going to purchase.  But we don\u2019t\u2014you know, that\u2019s going to be a long-term opportunity for the Company.","Brad Delco \u2013 Stephens Inc.","","Got you.  And then Dave, if I could just ask you one question because everything I\u2019ve heard on this call, it\u2019s long-term growth sounds very good, particularly in Mexico.  You know, the way that I thought about it, or think about it, and I\u2019d love to get your thoughts \u2013 if Mexico is really where the growth is, I think you have some sort of\u2014you have a cost advantage there relative to the U.S.  You still have a lot of low-hanging fruit with the leased fleet that you can convert to owning.  It seems like not only the top line should accelerate but there\u2019s still good, very clear ways to improve the OR.  How do you think about the balance between growth in Mexico versus U.S. and what that could do to your margins?","David Starling","Well again, we\u2019ve always stated that we have opportunities in Mexico.  We\u2019ve made it very clear we do have a lower cost structure there, but on the labor side we\u2019re working very well with labor but there is opportunities where we can create win-wins for ourselves and labor where we don\u2019t reduce any jobs, we just grow, and that\u2019s a big opportunity for us.  We\u2019ve got another maintenance contract coming up this year that we\u2019re reviewing that would be a fourth quarter event that we\u2019re taking a hard look at, which would be another legacy contract that we can come out of.  So we\u2019ll continue to do that, and I do agree with you and still stand by the statement \u2013 I think we do have more opportunities for leverage and upside of revenue in Mexico.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yeah, just a couple of things to tack onto that.  Don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that this, as I referred to the new energy market, is going to provide a lot of growth opportunities in the U.S., then go back to my comments on the auto industry.  We have auto and intermodal, we have a significant opportunity to increase the U.S. side of some of that business by using our U.S. network, and that\u2019s going to produce a lot of efficiencies in terms of longer length of haul, and that\u2019s generally going to help the profitability on the U.S. side of the equation.","Brad Delco \u2013 Stephens Inc.","","Very well.  Thanks, guys, for your time.","Operator","Thank you.  Mr. Starling, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","David Starling","Okay, thank you very much.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company which could materially differ from events that actually occur.

All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Michael Haverty, Executive Chairman for Kansas City Southern.","Mr. Haverty, you may begin.","Michael Haverty","Thank you for joining Kansas City Southern\u2019s fourth quarter and yearend 2011 earnings call.  I have here with me today presenting, Dave Starling, President and CEO; Dave Ebbrecht, our EVP, Operations; Pat Ottensmeyer, EVP, Sales and Marketing; Mike Upchurch, EVP and CFO.  Also with us today in here Kansas City is Jose Zozaya who is President and Executive Representative of Kansas City Southern to Mexico.  Jose will be available for questions.","If you\u2019ll turn to the slide that says KCS Overview, let me make a few remarks about the 125th anniversary of Kansas City Southern.  That took place on January 8.  And I will say that, over the last 20 years, that there are probably some folks that wondered whether we would make it to the 125th anniversary.  The railroad was for sale in 1993 and \u201994, Western Rail mergers took place in the mid-\u201890s, and a lot of people were writing the obituary of Kansas City Southern.","Then in 2000 when the company spun off the financial assets of the company and we had to do a very painful reverse one-for-two split, we went out on the market.  We did that because we were trying to maintain double-digit numbers.  We went out on the market on July 13 of 2000 at $5.75, and our market cap at that time was just over -- or just under $350 million.  The market cap at close today was just under $8 billion.  So, I think (inaudible) in Mexico, as you\u2019re going to hear from the team here today, was certainly a great thing that got us to this 125th anniversary.","Second bullet point on my comments, dramatic turnaround from 2008 to 2011.  The meltdown took place in the fall of 2008, and just things got fell off the end of the table there and our loadings just went down significantly.  But we have come back not only from a standpoint of loading, the car loads in the model units, but also with a total enhancement of the capital structure of Kansas City Southern.  That\u2019s down and spread out.  The cash flow and cash on hand has dramatically improved.  Debt ratings have been upgraded.  And the company has not been stronger during its 125 years.","Final comment, 42% stock price appreciation in 2011.  Some folks might say that\u2019s over the top.  I think there certainly has been a recognition and an understanding of the value of this franchise as it serves the growing manufacturing area of Mexico and connects with the rail carriers serving the US, Canada and Mexico.  We also have heard from time to time that KCS multiples are higher than the rest of the industry.  But if you look at our PE and our enterprise value over EBITDA ratios over the last decade, they have historically been above industry averages.","With that, I'm going to turn it over to Dave Starling, CEO, to continue with the presentation.","Dave Starling","Okay, Mike.  Thanks.","We\u2019ll turn to page seven, Fourth Quarter Results.  I\u2019d like to point out some of the highlights and then guide up to full-year 2011, how we matched up with the guidance we gave during the past year.","Fourth quarter volumes came in at about 7% higher than the previous year.  Automotive, intermodal and coal were all strong drivers of growth.  I don\u2019t want to steal any of Pat Ottenmeyer\u2019s thunder, but I\u2019ll take the 22% volume increase in automotive, 18% in intermodal, and 8% in coal (inaudible).","Chemicals and petroleum were a bit off in the quarter, but it does not appear that the slight decline had anything to do with either a slowing economy or KCS losing market share.  Our customers we spoke with in the chemical industry are pointing towards a destocking of inventories by end-users in the fourth quarter, particularly in plastics, which is a significant commodity for us.  While it\u2019s an industry-wide phenomenon, more specific to KCS was that one of the refineries we serve was down for maintenance during the quarter.  And another customer had to allocate some of its shipments to another rail carrier to meet its annual contractual obligation.","The good news is while chemicals and petroleum were down in the quarter, they bounced back in the first quarter.  Pat will have more to say about that later.","Revenue in the fourth quarter, up 11%.  Another solid quarter.  The revenue would have been greater if not for the weakening of the (inaudible) the dollar which alone reduced our quarter-over-quarter revenue growth by about 2%.","That being said, let me re-emphasize something we\u2019ve said many times before.  Swings in the currency exchange rate (inaudible) revenues on a quarterly basis have a very muted impact on our operating income.  The reason for this, [above the line], we have a good natural hedge against swings in the peso\/dollar exchange ratio, somewhere between 65% to 70% of our Mexico-generated revenues are dollar-denominated, while our Mexico costs were about 50\/50 dollar\/peso.","So, when our revenues are somewhat negatively impacted by a weaker peso, our expenses come in a little lower in the bottom line.  The overall effect on operating income is pretty insignificant.  Now, below the line, the story can be a bit different at times, and Mike Upchurch will take you through those numbers during his presentation.","Our fourth quarter operating ratio was 71.6 compared to 71.8 we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Mike Upchurch will also provide more colors to what went into our OR calculation in the fourth quarter, which kept it from being even lower.","Reported diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.87 compared with $0.50 a year ago, 74% increase.  If you adjust that debt retirement cost in both fourth quarter 2010 and 2011, diluted EPS was $1.01 and $0.62 respective, a 63% gain.","Next page, the full-year results.  KCS hits some significant milestones.  For the first time in our history, volumes hit the 2 million mark and revenues went above $2 billion.  It\u2019s especially gratifying to hit these historic numbers in light of the fact that a little over two years ago we were just beginning to struggle out of the worst economic environment since the Depression.  In 2009 we reported annual revenues of $1.5 billion, which were down 20% the year before.  Now two years later, we report 2011 revenues of $2.1 billion, 42% higher than 2009.","On a reported basis, our volumes were up 8% for the year, revenues were up about 16%.  Also on a reported basis, KCS 2011 operating ratio was 70.9.  You should note that this number includes insurance settlement we recorded in the third quarter for Hurricane Alex which struck Mexico in the third quarter of 2010.","Our reported diluted EPS for 2011 was $3, compared to $1.67 in 2010, an increase of 80%.  Adjusting out debt retirement for 2011, diluted EPS was $3.23 compared with $2.11 in 2010, a 53% increase.","Next page, talk about the update for the full year.  If you remember, we began 2011 estimating that we\u2019d achieve low double-digit revenue growth.  After the second quarter, we upped our revenue guidance to the mid-teens range, around 15%.","On a reported basis, KCS revenue grew by 16% year over year.  When you take out the impact of Hurricane Alex in 2010, our adjusted revenue gain in 2011 was more like 14%.  While you\u2019ll not find any of us sinking our heads about a 14% revenue gain rather than a 15% gain, you should note that the impact of the weaker peso on our revenues was about 2%.  No matter whether we quibble over a percentage point or not, we hit our mid-teens target for the year.","As far as volumes, we began this year pointing towards a mid-single-digit growth target.  This too we increased as of the second quarter to the 7% range.  As it turned out, we reported an 8% year-over-year increase.  Again adjusting for Hurricane Alex, that number was more like a 7% increase.","Pricing came in at 5.7% for the year, which is right where we guided to.  Revenue per unit was up 7% from 2010.","Finally, our operating ratio for 2011 came in at 70.9, compared with 73.2 in 2010.  Because of a hurricane in 2010 and the insurance settlement this year and some other factors, there were adjustments both to 2010 and 2011 operating ratios.  As I mentioned earlier, Mike Upchurch will take you through some further thoughts about our operating ratio in a few minutes.","However, the one thing which is indisputable was that after everything is said and done, KCS continues to improve its margins, and will continue to do so in 2012.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Dave Ebbrecht.","Dave Ebbrecht","Hi.  Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.","Starting on page 11, you can see that we really had a solid year in safety in 2011.  We\u2019re best in class in safety for the sixth year straight, while our volumes continue to grow at record levels and we expand our network.  The safety culture at KCS is something we work very hard in improving and fostering on a daily basis.  We will continue to sustain our progress in safety through consistently reinforcing our well-established expectations.","Next slide, if you look on page 12, I believe it\u2019s important to address our capacity from an infrastructure and a whirlwind stock asset perspective since we have been experiencing such good volume growth.  We review all of our business unit projections thoroughly years ahead of the actual volume increases.  It is through our cross-functional departmental analysis and decision-making that we\u2019re able to invest appropriately and create the capacity needed at the right place and at the right time.  We\u2019re comfortable though with our current capital projects, investments and available assets that we\u2019re able to continue to optimize our network\u2019s capacity for the foreseeable future.  We just completed the receipt of 30 new locomotives in December, and we\u2019ll ramp up our locomotive purchases as necessary to accommodate our current growth plans in the years ahead.","On the next slide, you can see the results of our extensive planning efforts with another critical assets, and that\u2019s crews.  Our crew utilization continues to get better and better as (inaudible) train and network capacity is targeted and consumed.  We\u2019re scaling below our volume growth through a combination of efforts.  Our greatest success has been (inaudible) continually managing the balance of the network, appropriate resource crew districts, combined with well-executed crew utilization and a disciplined and balanced network, and realize more train starts, more cars on those trains, and (inaudible) people.","Turning to slide 14, I believe it\u2019s very important to recognize the good performance we\u2019ve shown across all major operating metrics while we\u2019re growing at record rates.  Velocity (inaudible) are maintaining at appropriate levels necessary to deliver on customer expectations.  (inaudible) miles are drastically reduced over previous years and are indicative of the multiyear investment we\u2019ve committed to on our main line durability.","All three of these metrics result in better car efficiency and network fluidity.  We\u2019re able to handle more cars, nimbly adapt to seasonal surge in demand, and accommodate new business while maintaining our efficiencies.  As we continue to grow, we will see occasional dips.  But overall, the trend will remain in the range necessary to remain fluid.","Next slide.","Overall, the fourth quarter was very well-executed by operations.  The holiday shutdowns and startups went well.  We accommodated new business originally slated to start in 2012 while also adapting to add a cycle maintenance for other customers.  We were still fortunate to have such mild weather conditions throughout the winter.  This has resulted in much cleaner interchange and fluidity of traffic with our connecting carriers to the north.","Our 30 new locomotives are currently being utilized and we\u2019re well-poised for more growth.  We\u2019re experiencing very good car load volume starting out in 2012, and the entire team is fully focused on staying ahead of our projected growth.","We have major investment on our infrastructure that will take place in the upcoming year at our Shreveport hub, on our cross-border networks and corridor, and our Mexico intermodal lanes throughout the year.  We will also see continued productivity gains and strong headcount [controls] as the year progresses.","Now I\u2019ll hand it over to Pat to discuss sales and marketing.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good everyone.  I will begin my comments on slide 17 with a quick recap of the revenues and volumes for the quarter.","As we saw earlier, revenues for the fourth quarter $530.3 million, up 11% from last year.  Both revenue and car loads were the highest ever for a fourth quarter, and car loads actually set a new record for any quarter.  Our volumes increased slightly from the third quarter of 2011, which was the previous record.","Revenues were lower largely due to the impact of foreign exchange, which I\u2019ll explain later.  And as Dave mentioned earlier, adjusting for the FX reduction, revenue growth would have been 12.7% over last year.  RPU was higher than last year, again in spite of the weaker peso, which reduced average RPU by about $17.","Moving to the next slide, these are the factors contributing to revenue growth.  And as you can see here, every component was positive except for foreign exchange which reduced revenues by $9 million.  I think I gave some guidance about this in the third quarter call in October, and the peso continued to be even weaker -- at weaker levels just as we had forecasted at that time.","Same-store pricing contributed $16 million to the revenue increase.  The pool of revenue related to same-store movements was $320 million or approximately 72% of our length of haul revenue for the quarter.  As I\u2019ll get into on the next slide, effective core pricing impact for the quarter was 5.7% on a same-store basis.","Increase in fuel surcharge revenue contributed $21 million over -- in the revenue growth, and fuel costs have recently dropped.  However, we continue to experience positive year-over-year fuel surcharge revenues as the price is still higher than this time last year.","The peso\/dollar exchange rate began to rise in September and continued upward trend towards the fourth quarter, that an average, a year-over-year increase of about 11%.  The current rates are the highest since the first quarter of 2009 and continue, although they\u2019ve come down recently, continue to have a negative impact on year-over-year revenue.","As Dave mentioned earlier, it\u2019s worth reminding you again that FX fluctuations will have an impact on our revenue, but that impact is substantially offset by reducing our peso-denominated expenses.  And as Mike will get into later, the impact on operating income and operating ratio is negligible.  The increase in mix and other was driven by [length of haul] and higher other revenue, and to some extent, mix.","Moving to slide 19, we show the revenue per loaded car mile for the business units.  This excludes fuel surcharge, mix and foreign exchange.  So this is what we use to measure same-store sales.","As you can see from this graph, same-store pricing was higher in every business unit for the quarter, and overall increased by 5.7% over the fourth quarter of last year.  Again, every business unit had increases in same-store pricing, and the range was 3.6% to 7.7%.","5.7 is down a little bit from the prior quarter due to lower changes in coal pricing.  All of our coal legacy contracts were repriced by the third quarter of 2010, so we will expect to see slightly less positive pricing impact from coal going forward as future pricing adjustments are largely driven by RCAF.","Turning to slide 20 which shows the results by business units, there\u2019s a lot going on here in this quarter, so I\u2019ll take a little more time to explain what we\u2019re seeing in the businesses.","First, I would say, I think it\u2019s even more remarkable to have record quarterly volumes in a quarter where we saw three of our business units show year-over-year decreases in volume.  Second, for those business units showing decreases, I feel there are specific reasons, largely unrelated to the general economy, that drove these reductions, and as I\u2019ll show you on the following slide, we have seen strength and improvement in each of those areas in the first few weeks of 2012 and still feel very positive about the outlook for growth in 2012 and beyond.","Just to get into the details here a bit.  Chemical and petroleum showed declines in both volume and revenue.  Foreign exchange was a factor in the revenue decline as two of our largest customers in Mexico are peso-based.  Had it not been for the FX impacts, revenues would have been slightly above last year in this business unit.","The bigger drivers were volume related to -- related but included a couple of key plant outages that we experienced in the fourth quarter, one customer that was impacted by a contract dispute with one of their customers, and some general destocking and inventory management that we believe was taking place heading into yearend.  You\u2019ll see evidence of this and the subsequent recovery on the next slide.","For the industrial -- excuse me.  For industrial and consumer business, the decline in volume was heavily influenced by maintenance and temporary production difficulties at two of our large fuel customers, as well as reduced military shipments in the United States.  Again, as you\u2019ll see on the following slide, January trends show a reversal of the yearend pattern.  What is remarkable about this group is the sharp increase in RPU, which was up 17% from 2010.  This is driven by strong pricing and length of haul, including a 26% increase in cross-border traffic in this business, as well as continued shifting through higher capacity, higher RPU equipment which has been the focus of our yield management group for the past couple of years.","Ag and mineral volumes declined primarily due to three factors: loss of a major food product shipper due to relocation of a facility in Mexico away from KCS, lower soybean shipment to the Gulf of Mexico due to global competition, primarily South America, and continued high corn inventories in Mexico which has adversely impacted our cross-border traffic.  The RPU increase here is primarily pricing and fuel.","Now, shifting briefly to the brighter side of the quarter, our coal business was very strong in the quarter, driven primarily by accelerated deliveries of a new contract that officially began January 1.  This is a new customer for KCS under a five-year contract.","Intermodal growth continued to achieve record levels in revenues as we gain momentum on cross-border shipments and (inaudible) achieved record levels.  I\u2019ll show you more about those in a moment.","And finally, automotive volumes and revenues were also at record levels, in the case of revenues, in spite of a fairly heavy impact to foreign exchange on this business unit, revenue growth here would have been closer to 40% excluding the impact of foreign exchange.  Cross-border shipments continued to be strong, up over 100% from 210 for the full year and up over 60% from the third quarter of 2011, and a lot of room to grow from here.","Moving to slide 21, as I mentioned before, this slide demonstrates the volume recovery that we\u2019ve seen in January for the three business units that showed year-over-year declines in the fourth quarter.  In the ag and minerals business, we typically see a drop in December, with some pickup in January.  The drop in December last year was stronger than normal, and we are seeing stronger improvement in January to levels which are obviously you see here well above December run rate, as well as well above January of 2011.","APM Terminals, which is an affiliate of Maersk line, we still don\u2019t know a lot of the details about APM\u2019s specific development plans, but they have announced the project will involve investment at $900 million in phases over several years, and will focus, among other things, will be the future potential of the US gulf market.  We believe their announcement further validates the belief that [Lazaro Cardinus] will continue to be one of if not the most fastest-growing of the major ports in North America, and clearly represents an outstanding growth opportunity for Kansas City Southern.","Moving to slide 25, the market outlook.  You can see that we are expecting growth in all of our business units, and in total, expect 2012 to be another year of low double-digit growth, as Dave will get into the broader outlook a little bit later.","I will also say that foreign exchange could make a difference in some of these businesses, and if we see strengthening of the peso, some of these singles could become doubles.  Just to give you some additional guidance, about 13% of our total consolidated revenues are denominated in pesos, obviously all of that in Mexico.  A one-peso move against the dollar, in other words, moving from 14 to 13, will have a $23 million impact on our total revenues.","As for the specific business units, I\u2019ve already spent quite a bit of time on the first three.  And in spite of the positive trends that we saw in early part of January, we\u2019re still guiding to single-digit growth in the first quarter, with industrial and consumer achieving full low double-digit growth, low teens, for the full year.","In the coal business, due to some scheduled maintenance that\u2019s going to occur later in this quarter, coal will likely be a single-digit growth for the first quarter.  Once we get through the maintenance cycles and some new business opportunities will drive double-digit growth for the full year.","Intermodal growth will continue to be driven by market share gains as a result of the truck conversion (inaudible) growth, and growth in the overall market, strong double-digit growth in both of those for first quarter and for 2012.","And finally, in our automotive business, we expect to continue to be very strong as Mexican production and production of plants that we serve have grown more rapidly than the overall market.  Overall we are still projecting low double-digit revenue growth for 2012 based on new opportunities and strong pricing increases on existing business.  A stronger peso would help move some of this into double-digit territory.","And finally, my market development slide here is pretty similar to what you\u2019ve seen in prior quarters.  The overall outlook for the economy is positive in both the US and Mexico.  I\u2019ve already touched on the cross-border conversion, but that is continuing to gain momentum, particularly in intermodal and automotive.  The long-term automotive outlook is very bright.  Planned new and expanded plants in Mexico are expected to increase Mexican finished vehicle production by nearly 40% by 2015.","In addition, in spite of a substantial increase in our cross-border finished vehicle shipments, KCS still has a fairly small market share of cross-border movements today, so there\u2019s even more potential by converting existing business to cross-border.  We still believe that core pricing will remain in the mid-single-digit range.","And lastly, our new business pipeline continues to grow and be very strong, going back to the APM Terminals announcement, it was very encouraging to see them mention in their press release their belief in the Mexican market and the fact that near-sourcing benefits to logistics providers serving North America was a factor in their decision to invest in this terminal.  Their conviction to make a $900 million investment is solid validation of what we\u2019ve been saying about the Mexican market and opportunity.","You\u2019ll notice one addition to our opportunities discussion, which is export coal, we are seeing a lot of interest on the part of US producers moving coal through the new PPP facility at [Lazaro Cardinus] which will open this spring.  The short story here is that coal produced in the central part of the US, Powder River Basin, Colorado and Illinois Basin, wants to move to Asia, and Asia wants to buy it.  The problem is getting it to a port and getting it on the water.  Port capacity is very constrained, particularly off the West Coast of the United States.","While we don\u2019t have any contracts at this point or specific commitments, the global supply and demand outlook at the level of interest we are seeing from producers suggest that we will move some coal through [Lazaro Cardinus].  The size and timing of this opportunity is still very uncertain.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone.  I'm going to start my comments on slide 28.  I won\u2019t go through all of these numbers, but give you a few highlights.","Again, fourth quarter revenues increased 11% while operating income was up 11.3%.  Interest expense declined $31.4 million due to the refinancing of debt that lowered our overall effective interest rate to 7.4% during the quarter.","Due to the declining peso, we did record a $2.3 million foreign currency loss in the quarter.  The exchange rate at the end of the year was nearly 14 compared to 13.4 at September 30.  Currently, the exchange rate has improved and stands at 13.2 again.","Debt retirement costs were $24.6 million in the quarter, and the result of retiring our 13% KCSR notes with cash on hand in December.  We did use approximately $140 million of cash to retire these notes.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 1%, a reflection of the peso devaluation, and the non-cash tax benefits we recorded related to the US-dollar-denominated debt that we had in Mexico.  And I\u2019ll provide a few more details on that in a few minutes.","Net income increased 73% to $96 million.  Excluding debt retirement costs, adjusted EPS was $1.01.  But it\u2019s important to note that the lower effective tax rate did positively impact our quarter by $0.23 (inaudible) think about the quarter being $0.23 lower than the $1.01 adjusted EPS.","And I\u2019ll also comment in a few slides about some unfavorable year-over-year fuel comparisons along with some additional incentive compensation we booked in the quarter that did have negative impacts to both OR and EPS.","On slide 29, let me talk about the full year.  Revenues increased 16%, operating income increased 26%.","Focusing on the interest expense, we saw a decline year-over-year of nearly $30 million, the result of debt reductions during 2010 and a variety of refinancing activity that both contributed to lowering our full-year effective rate to about 7.5%.","I would point out that at our peak debt levels and prior to our refinancing activities and debt reduction efforts, our peak quarterly interest expense would have equated to nearly $182 million of annual interest.  So we have reduced interest expense by $53 million, and we\u2019ll continue to reduce interest in 2012.","For the full year, we experienced a $9.2 million FX loss.  Again, at the end of the year, the FX rate was almost 14, compared to 12.36 at 12\/31\/2010.  And the FX rate has improved again and stands right now at 13.2.","For the full year, the effective tax rate was 27%, lower than the 34% we guided on our third quarter call.  As you may recall, we guided the 34% based on the Central Bank of Mexico forecasted yearend exchange rate of 12.6.  The exchange rate actually ended at almost 14, thus providing us a greater tax benefit for the year.  This benefit, I would remind you, is a non-cash tax benefit and again related to our US-dollar-denominated debt.  And I\u2019ll go through the details of that in a couple of slides.","Moving to slide 30, our reported expenses increased 10.5%.  And in the table on the right, you can see the key drivers of the expense increases.  Our volume-driven expenses were up about $13 million, and those consist primarily of variable compensation, intermodal costs, car hire, and fuel volumes.","You can see fuel price also increased year over year by $17 million.  And as I mentioned earlier, during the fourth quarter we did record some additional incentive compensation to the tune of about $6 million.  This adjustment did negatively impact our OR by slightly more than one percentage point and EPS by approximately $0.03.  Due to the decline in the peso, expenses were lower by $8 million, and as Pat previously indicated, revenues were lower by $9 million, thus creating pretty negligible impact on operating income for the quarter.","On slide 31, let me provide you a little bit more color on the effective tax rate for the year.  Again, during the third quarter call, we did guide to 34%, which is based on the Central Bank of Mexico projection of exchange rate of 12.6.  This devaluation in the peso creates a non-cash tax benefit related to this US-dollar-denominated debt in Mexico.  And in essence, the tax rules in Mexico allow a current-year deduction for this valuation as it would now theoretically require more pesos to extinguish the US-dollar-denominated debt.  Therefore, during the quarter we trued up the full-year rate and recorded a tax benefit.  And as you can see from the bottom slide, we experienced the exact opposite in 2010 when the peso was strengthening, which had caused our effective tax rate to increase above the statutory rate by 6.4%.  So, effectively, over the two years, we washed between the foreign exchange impact on our tax rate.","And maybe one final bit of color, on our third quarter call, I did mention that as a general rule of thumb, a 0.1 change in the FX rate can impact our effective tax rate by approximately 50 basis points.  So, in light of the exchange rate moving 1.4 percentage points during the quarter, we would have expected roughly a seven-point decline in the effective tax rate, which is in fact what we saw in terms of the 34% guidance and 27% reported rate.  So, hopefully that provides a little bit of clarity on the tax rate during the quarter.","Moving to slide 32, let me spend just a minute on -- in compensation and benefits, which increased 12% year over year.  As you can see on the table on the left-hand side of the slide, headcount increased about 0.5% despite volume increases of 7%.  Our operations team continues to do an excellent job managing headcount.","Accordingly, along with wage inflation, compensation expenses increased by $7 million in the quarter.  And we did record additional incentive comp in the fourth quarter as a result of higher payout estimates for the full year that led to a $6 million increase in the quarter.  Foreign exchange also benefited compensation by about $3 million.","Moving to slide 33, fuel expense was up 24%, almost all of it due to price increase.  We estimate that, in the chart on the right, the negative fuel lags for the quarter was about $2.8 million or $0.02 per share.  And for those of you interested in our price per gallon, in the US, our fourth quarter average was $3.12 on about 17 million gallons.  And in Mexico, this is adjusted, was $2.36 per gallon, with about 15.4 million gallons consumed.  And then on a consolidated basis, we\u2019re at $2.75 average price and 32.4 million gallons consumed.","Finally, on slide 34, we did generate for the second year in a row very strong free cash flow of $175 million.  And as we\u2019ve discussed with investors and analysts before, our priority to date has been to delever the balance sheet and improve our financial flexibility, and we did that again during the quarter, fully retiring the remaining 13% notes.","At this point, we\u2019re pretty comfortable with our debt levels and will largely improve our credit profit through continued earnings generation and, to a lesser degree, through further debt repayments.  Our overall credit metrics are reflective of an investment grade company.  Moody\u2019s recently improved the credit rating of the company, raised us to BA1s, or one step from officially being investment grade on our unsecured rating.  And as the debt markets continue to be very attractive, we do have some additional refinancing opportunities that could continue to lower interest expense and improve our maturity profile.","Our next priority is then to continue to invest in the business, and we did that during 2011, really to capture exceptional revenue growth opportunities.  As you can see, our core capital invested was about 18% of revenues, and we did accelerate the investment of 30 new locomotives into 2011 to capture the 100% bonus depreciation, and we also used some additional cash to convert some leased assets to owned assets, namely locomotives and intermodal facility.","So, we continue to focus on making necessary investments to position ourselves for exceptional growth.  And consistent with our thoughts over the past year, during 2012 we will consider potential shareholder returns.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Dave.","Dave Starling","Okay.  Thank you, Mike.","If you turn to slide 36, I\u2019ll be brief, (inaudible) railway had another strong quarter, rounding out a very successful year.  Volumes up 23%, revenues up 31%, operating ratio 52.9 for the full year -- or for the quarter and 50.9 for the full year.  Hard to complain about that.","Next page, since it\u2019s our 125th anniversary, I thought it\u2019d be important to take another quick lookback.  If you look at the operating ratio performance, before turning to some top line guidance, there are a couple of charts, show you just how far we\u2019ve come in a short period of time.","This first chart looks at KCS\u2019s operating ratio performance relative to its railroad peers from 2006.  We ended at the third quarter only because we obviously don\u2019t have everyone\u2019s full numbers yet.  As you can see, from 2006 to 2009, KCS was a bit of an outlier, consistently higher than the group.  We had made some progress in \u201907 and \u201908, but the recession which hit in the second half of 2008 set us back a bit.  But when you look at 2010 and 2011, it becomes apparent that KCS has joined the pack.  Our margins match those of our peers.  A number of factors have driven our OR improvement: increased volumes, good pricing, more efficient operations have been prime contributors.","If I have to single out one factor which really stands out is the emergence of our long-haul cross-border business, including the completion of our international intermodal corridor.  If anyone ever doubted that the impact of long-haul moves on profitability, this chart should put those doubts to rest.  Length of haul is by no means the only reason for our improvement, but it certainly is an important one.","The second chart illustrates how KCS operating ratio has improved relative to the five-year plan we presented to our Board of Directors at the time we had our Analyst Day in Kansas City in March 2007.  As you can see, despite the recession-related setback in 2009, we are ending 2011 considerably better than the target set for ourselves in 2007.  And anyway you look at 2011, we\u2019ve taken 10 points off the operating ratio in five years.  But make no mistake about it, we\u2019re by no means satisfied and remain totally committed to taking our operating ratio into the 60s.","Now let\u2019s turn to the guidance page.  Looking out to 2012, our top-line guidance is really not significantly different from what we laid out a year ago.  What is different is that we\u2019re working off a higher base, which means that even if the targets appear familiar, the bar is being raised considerably higher.","We see our 2012 volumes and pricing both increasing in the mid-single-digit range.  Pat has provided some guidance as to areas where we see the greatest potential for significant volume growth.  We also have enough visibility into 2012 repricing to be comfortable with the mid-single-digit projections for both volume and pricing.","These volumes and pricing projections lead us towards a 2012 revenue projection in the low double digits.  Having just experienced a quarter in which the peso weakened relative to the dollar, I feel I should state clearly that our low-double-digit revenue increase is predicated on a stable peso.  Obviously we have no control over the peso, but remember, our natural dollar\/peso hedge in terms of Mexican-generated revenues and expenses largely mitigates the impact of currency fluctuations on our operating income.","We will continue to improve our operating ratio in 2012.  Having exceeded the guidance given in 2007 by improving operating ratio over the last five years by more than 10 points, we are pleased to be in the range of the Class 1\u2019s.  Our next goal is to have the operating ratio start with a six.  It may not be in 2012, but certainly doable in the future.","Finishing up and keeping with what we\u2019ve guided to in 2011, we\u2019re targeting our core capacity spending to come in at the 17% to 18% of revenue range.  That amount will give us ample resource to both maintain our system and spend the dollars necessary to maximize our business growth opportunities.","With that, we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.

One moment please while we poll for questions.","Thank you.  Our first question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley-Smith Barney.  Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley-Smith Barney","Hey there.  Good evening.  Dave, you made some interesting comments about length of haul.  I'm wondering if you could just share with us what\u2019s been the change in length of haul over the last few years, because I think it\u2019s an interesting relationship between OR and length of haul, and I'm not sure there\u2019s as much color as I\u2019d like around that.  Maybe you can help us think that through.","Dave Starling","Bill, if you go back to Pat\u2019s graph on the cross-border conversion and you look at our cross-border revenues, up around 25%, that has really been the driver.  Also a couple of our [full] moves are very long-haul moves deep into our system, but mainly it\u2019s been the cross-border we\u2019re getting moves all the way from Meridian into Mexico, Jackson into Mexico, and Kansas City deep into Mexico.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley-Smith Barney","How much has length of haul actually moved for the system?  Is it sort of a 10% move overall or is it much lower than that?","Unidentified Company Representative","In terms of, you know, I think if you look at, as Dave mentioned, the percent of cross-border movement, we\u2019ve certainly gotten the benefit of increased length of haul in both US and Mexico, but as Dave mentioned, our intermodal cross-border business, you can just kind of look at the growth there.  Most of that intermodal cross-border business is not terminating on the KCS systems; it\u2019s going to a gateway and moving into markets in, you know, on the [inner line] move that -- into another railroad\u2019s markets.  So that\u2019s given us the opportunity to get length of haul of 1,500, 2,000 miles on the cross-border intermodal product.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley-Smith Barney","All right.  One of the things you guys have done in the past as well has done some JVs and with some success.  And we often sort of think about kind of growth opportunities in your world being sort of organic, but there are certainly some strategic opportunities you could get involved in.  How do you think about new growth avenues?  Is JV, is that a realistic approach you could take, or is that not something you're going to pursue.","Dave Starling","I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about, Bill.  I mean, we will work with any company if the revenue opportunity is right and it\u2019s a win-win for us.  But generally speaking, what we\u2019ve done with our intermodal product is there is a huge market conversion opportunity, and we have not tried to partner with any specific asset owner.  We basically have opened up the international intermodal corridor for all of the participants, and working very hard with our connecting line carriers to also allow them to penetrate Mexico.  We know the near-sourcing down there is very important for CSX and CN and NS and BN, for those railroads to have access to Mexico and to this growth.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley-Smith Barney","Do you have a sense for what the organic growth rate is on that cross-border, not market share gains or just sort of opportunity of taking truck share and whatnot, but just what that trade is sort of growing up last year?","Dave Starling","Well, we know that the study we\u2019ve identified and we\u2019ve shared with you has been 2.6 million truckloads in the past, and we still look right now, we\u2019re still -- 2%, Pat?","Pat Ottensmeyer","One percent.","Dave Starling","Yeah, Bill, a little over 1%.  But you can look at the overall growth in trade between US and Mexico and get a feel -- get a decent feel for what the organic growth has been.  And then we\u2019ve got, as you mentioned, a great market share shift from truck to rail in addition to that.","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley-Smith Barney","All right.  Thanks for the time.","Dave Starling","Okay, Bill.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.  Please proceed with your question.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks.  Good evening.  A couple of items.  Is there any risk of your future growth plans for moving crude oil from the change in the direction of the seaway pipeline?","Dave Starling","We\u2019ve talked about the crude oil movements in the past.  We are moving some crude.  It\u2019s not moving in unit trains, but we are moving some crude out into the Gulf.  It\u2019s not significant at this point.  We\u2019ve talked about it as a potential opportunity.","And what\u2019s happened since the announcements were made late last year about the seaway and other pipelines, is that a lot of the momentum, a lot of the discussions that we were having with potential customers have slowed down.  Everyone is waiting to kind of see what this all means, what the timing is, what kind of capacity is going to be available for them.  So, it has caused some of our discussions about that opportunity to slow down.  But I would say that there\u2019s still quite a bit of interest and there\u2019s still -- it\u2019s a huge market.","And if you look at the seaway in particular, that pipeline runs from Cushing to Houston and it would only be in phase three which would be -- which would require the construction of a new pipeline that would move that product from Houston to Port Arthur.","So, long and short of it, it has caused the -- everyone to kind of step back and assess what\u2019s going to happen and what it\u2019s going to mean for the crude by rail, but we still feel that there will be an opportunity there.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.  Another energy-related question, I think you mentioned something about plastics and maybe you had some plans that were offline, or traffic that was diverted.  But if I think about broader shift in energy, it seems like some of the plastics manufacturer may start to move north to be closer to the source of cheap natural gas.  Is there a risk in your chemicals business if that happens, or are you seeing any signs that that might unfold?","Dave Starling","No.  In fact, in the last few months of 2011, or probably the last six months of 2011, there were, that I'm aware of, there were six announcements of companies that were looking to build or expand manufacturing capacity basically from Corpus Christi to New Orleans.  So, not all of those plants have developed into specific plans or timelines, but just based on the announcements and the conversations that we\u2019ve had with customers, we still see that as a big opportunity.  Don\u2019t forget that the Eagle Ford Shale is really one of the biggest gas producers and it\u2019s there in South Texas.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Right, okay.  And then just lastly, you mentioned, just want to clarify, that coal pricing going forward will be limited just to the RCAF increase, is that right?  And does that weigh on your -- I'm sorry, go ahead.","Dave Starling","It\u2019ll be more closely tied to that because we did complete renegotiation of all of our -- of all longer-term contracts by the middle of 2010.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","But you still think overall for that, the system, you can do mid-single-digit pricing growth?","Dave Starling","Yes.","Chris Ceraso \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay.  Thank you.","Dave Starling","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherby with Citigroup Incorporated.  Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherby \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thanks.  Good evening, guys.","Dave Starling","Hi, Chris.","Chris Wetherby \u2013 Citigroup","Maybe just on the cost side, could I ask a couple of questions, just how you think about 2012?  You\u2019ve laid out kind of the revenue opportunity for you, maybe specifically with comp and benefit, how do you think about kind of headcount and maybe cost inflation on a per employee basis for 2012?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, cost inflation, Chris, we\u2019re probably looking at 3.5%.  And I think from a headcount standpoint, we feel pretty comfortable continuing to manage headcount below our volume growth.","Chris Wetherby \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.  And I think you guys have said a couple of times recently that you might be able to keep it closer to flat.  I mean, I guess on a relative basis, are we talking about something in the very low single digits or would it be potentially maybe 100 basis points lower than what your volume side looks like?","Dave Starling","Yeah, I think that\u2019s about right.  You saw a half-percent increase year over year, and we feel pretty good about being able to continue to manage somewhere in that low-single-digit range.","Chris Wetherby \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.","Dave Starling","With mid-single-digit volume increases.","Chris Wetherby \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.  That\u2019s very helpful, I appreciate it.","And then just as a follow-up question, just on Lazaro, clearly good stuff going on there, whether it be the concession from Maersk and then the potential for export coal opportunities.  As you think about CapEx, I know you\u2019ve given us a range for next year, how do we think about specific opportunities at Lazaro, or needs rather, at Lazaro?  Are there -- is there anything that you need now or is it more of kind of 14 and 15 in go-forward period that you have to make more investments?","Dave Starling","Chris, this is Dave.  We looked at our plan in Mexico and moved some capital around on ties.  There are some more ties we wanted to put in between [Maril] and Lazaro to kind of get it ready for the coal if it does come.  So, all we did is just shift some resources around, we kept the budget the same.  And then we\u2019ve got the 30 locomotives that were just delivered in December, and we\u2019ll probably have some locomotive orders coming up in the next year or two as well.  I don\u2019t really -- there\u2019s nothing significant -- in fact, out of Lazaro, we still have some room to grow on some of our trains.  So, we\u2019re very excited about APM getting that second concession.  We\u2019ve been waiting on that for sometime.","But it\u2019s going to be 18 months at the best before they have a birth down there, may even take a little longer than that.  So, we\u2019ve got time for that.  And again, we will cost in the export coal on the required locomotives and that would be more of a locomotive issue because they\u2019ll furnish cars.","Chris Wetherby \u2013 Citigroup","Okay.  That\u2019s very helpful.  I appreciate the time.","Dave Starling","Nice long move from Kansas City all the way down.","Chris Wetherby \u2013 Citigroup","That would be a good length of haul.  That\u2019s great.  Thanks for the time guys, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan Chase.  Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Yeah, good evening.  So I guess I\u2019ll start on the topic of coal, more on coal.  How much natural gas price sensitivity do you think you have in your utility coal franchise?  I guess we don\u2019t think of PRB coal being that sensitive, but when gas prices get low enough, you wonder.  So, is there, I guess, any sense you can give us on kind of risks to low natural gas prices?","Unidentified Company Representative","Hard to know, Tom, but certainly in a market like Texas where there is low natural gas produced electricity, we serve a couple of plants in Texas that could be affected.  We\u2019re working with our customers to try to identify exactly what the price points are on natural gas.  So, we certainly have a couple of plants that are affected by that, but it\u2019s really hard to quantify at this point what that could mean in terms of changes to our volume or business mix.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I mean, have you seen any early indications that utilities are actually taking action to utilize their plant\u2019s life and fire up gas plants more, or is that --","Unidentified Company Representative","It\u2019s not so much that, it\u2019s really -- but it\u2019s similar, the impact of plants that we serve that could be affected by competing plants, or plants that would burn a different mix of PRB and Texas lignite, for example, to bring their costs down.  But we think that if natural gas prices certainly collapse from where they are or go much lower, we could see some of that, but we haven\u2019t really seen it happen yet.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay.  And then the follow-up, on the comp and benefits per worker, Mike, I think you pointed out in the fourth quarter you had a bit of a headwind from incentive comp rising.  When you look at 2012 and think about comp and benefits per worker, does that number decelerate somewhat from the experience in 2011?  Or does it stay at what\u2019s fairly high level?","Mike Upchurch","Well, I think I mentioned cost inflation to be about 3.5% and then, you know, it\u2019s always a little bit of a guess on what incentive comp might be, but I don\u2019t really see any other significant drivers of cost increases in comp and benefits.  And again, we\u2019ll manage the headcount levels very well in the operating side of the business.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","So that 3.5% is kind of overall inflation or that 3.5% is in comp and benefit per worker?","Mike Upchurch","Comp and benefits per worker.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, aside from potential incentive impact I guess?","Mike Upchurch","Correct.","Tom Wadewitz \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay.  Okay.  Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna Financial.  Please proceed with your question.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Yeah, thanks.  Two questions.  One on the dividend or potential return of capital to shareholder.  Previously I think had leaned towards a dividend, looking at your model and projections, what you did in free cash this year versus what\u2019s implied in your guidance for next year, I mean we\u2019ll north of $200 million free cash flow.  I was wondering if you're still leaning towards a dividend, what the timing might look like.  And more importantly, what are you benchmarking, is it the other Class 1\u2019s, are you looking at midcap stocks?  I'm just trying to get a sense for where they might fall out.","Dave Starling","This is Dave.  As we\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s definitely on our radar screen.  It\u2019s shining brighter on the screen as we get more of this refinancing done, take the interest costs out, make sure we\u2019ve got adequate cash to keep our system running and expand.  But it is definitely on the radar screen.  And again, our preference is still from a dividend or stock buyback, is dividend.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","And in terms of benchmarking, is there something we should be thinking about of what you will model in terms of either payout ratio or what do you consider your [comp growth]?","Mike Upchurch","Matt, certainly we\u2019ve taken a look at that, and I don\u2019t believe given our better growth profile, that we need to be at industry averages.  So, if we make that decision in the future, I think you should expect it to be lower than what the industry is.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Got it.  Thank you.  And the second question would be, just in terms of customer collocation along your lines down in Mexico, it\u2019s a longer-term question, but it\u2019s just in the news and it comes up every now and then in investor discussions, the security situation (inaudible) US border, just could you maybe refresh us in terms of why that\u2019s not necessarily an issue or a burning issue for KSU and your operations down in Mexico, as the crime situation seems to have deteriorated markedly in 2011?  Thank you.","Dave Starling","We\u2019re actually starting out 2012 with less noise.  In talking to a couple of our Board members this morning, they\u2019re also saying there could be a little less noise in Mexico.  It still has not been an issue for us.  We have had some spot issues on what we call our F-line, from Monterray to Matamoros.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Right.","Dave Starling","-- go in and clean those up.  We stop them and they go away.  And it\u2019s still been more of a competitive advantage for us versus truck, versus other competition.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","But to the extent folks have said that -- they\u2019ve indicated plans to collocate or to do business with KSU, you haven\u2019t seen anyone change those plans or pull back?","Dave Starling","To collocate, you mean build on our line?","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Correct.","Dave Starling","Yeah.  No.  We have not.","Matt Troy \u2013 Susquehanna Financial","Okay.  Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Corporation.  Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Hey, good afternoon.  If I could just start off with a simple numerical one.  Your car loads seemed a little bit different than the AAR in terms of the growth rate.  Is there anything outstanding?  I mean, if I just looked at some of the major categories like chem, ag and industrials, it seemed a little shy.  Is there anything off the top of your head, Pat, that you would know why that would be different?","Pat Ottensmeyer","No.  I'm not aware of any reason there\u2019d be a difference.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Okay.  It just seemed like they were a little bit higher.","So, if I could just jump in on the pricing.  Pat, you mentioned kind of mid single digits.  It seems like you had been doing about 5.5% to 6% pure pricing over the past two years.  Now this quarter is about just over 5%.  Are we seeing a lot of those legacy contracts having now priced in and you're looking at kind of inflation-plus type of number going forward?  I just want to understand, are there chances that you have some other contracts that can boost that up a bit?  Or should we look at that to continue to slow down?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s slowed down much, Ken.  I mean, 5.7%, I don\u2019t know if you're picking up the right number for the quarter, was 5.7%, if I look back over the last four quarters, the range has been 5.4% to 6.1%, and 5.7% is actually the second-highest that we\u2019ve reported in the last four quarters.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","No, got it.  I thought you said 5.1%.  I'm sorry, Pat.","Pat Ottensmeyer","No, no.  It\u2019s 5.7%.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Okay.  And then on the -- just following up on the timing of -- you talked about the coal going to Lazaro, or -- yeah, down to the port, and also crude moving to Port Arthur eventually.  Is there any development or enhanced contract discussions going on that could expedite some of those?","Dave Starling","We are having contract discussions with a lot of people to expedite it as soon as we can.  As I mentioned in the case of the crude oil, these announcements about the pipeline reversals has certainly caused people to just kind of take a little bit of a pause and see how that\u2019s all going to work and what\u2019s going to be available, and timing and capacity and all of that.","Crude oil -- or I'm sorry, the export coal, the facility down at Lazaro is not yet open, and we\u2019re expecting it to be end of the first quarter, early second quarter.  And we\u2019re trying to, you know, we\u2019re engaged pretty heavily with a couple of producers that are very interested in looking at that opportunity as quickly as the middle of the year, second half of the year.","Again, we don\u2019t have anything on hand.  It\u2019s got to be competitive with world prices.  We think we\u2019re in the ballpark.  And once the facility opens, we\u2019re certainly prepared to get the locomotives and spend the capital to take advantage of that opportunity.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","So, on the Savage announcement, it doesn\u2019t sound like -- does it sound like it\u2019s gotten more heated because of their announcement over a year ago, or?","Dave Starling","No.  I mean we\u2019ve been working with Savage to identify potential shippers and subscribers and customers and all of that still going on.  It\u2019s just there\u2019s been a bit of a pause while people absorb and understand the impact of these pipeline announcements.","Ken Hoexter \u2013 Bank of America","Great.  Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Art Hatfield with Morgan Keegan.  Please proceed with your question.","Art Hatfield \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Evening, everyone.  Just really one question; most of my other questions have been answered.  But Pat, if you think about, or I guess this could be for anybody, but if you were to start to materially improve your market share of cross-border traffic, besides rolling stock, are there any other significant investments that you\u2019d need to do in infrastructure?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Not infrastructure.  Again, most of the rolling stock, as you know, is shared fleet.  The containers are privately-owned for the most part, although we do own some containers.  But we have a lot of train capacity for our intermodal product.  We\u2019re working for, you know, to convert it, and fill up the utilization.","I think we spent a lot of money on terminals, you're aware of that.  We bought two terminals over the last two years to really complete our network.  We built a new terminal at Rosenberg, we expanded a terminal in Monterrey.  So we\u2019ve spent a lot of money, and as Dave has pointed out to me, we spent a lot of money on the intermodal network and it\u2019s time to light it up.  So, I think we can run for quite a while here without a lot of additional capital.","Art Hatfield \u2013 Morgan Keegan","Thank you.  And just one other question on pricing, you had mentioned the impact on pricing going forward from the rollover of some of these legacy contracts on the call side.  Are there any other areas to think about where you would see maybe the potential greatest risk or potential greatest positive upside to pricing over the next 12 months?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Nothing really stands out on either the risk or the opportunity side.  And I\u2019ll go back, I don\u2019t feel like we did a great job of answering Bill\u2019s question at the beginning about cross-border length of haul, we don\u2019t disclose a lot of details, having disclosed specifically about length of haul.  But the cross-border, as I mentioned, our cross-border intermodal business is about 10% of our total intermodal business unit volumes right now, and obviously a lot of room to grow, and you\u2019ve seen the growth that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years.  The length of haul for our cross-border is typically more than double what it is for either our US or Mexico -- intra-Mexico\/intra-US, again because a lot of our focus on cross-border intermodal has been to move to final, you know, origins or destinations that are beyond the reach of KCS.  So it\u2019s Atlanta, the Southeast, it\u2019s northern Ohio, it\u2019s places that really stretch our network out to the maximum gateways, Meridian, Kansas City, Saint Louis.  So, those are very long-haul moves.","And that\u2019s probably about as specific as we\u2019ll get.  But as that cross-border product grows as a percentage of our total intermodal, it\u2019s going to have a big impact on length of haul again we\u2019re moving this to the end of our network and not just a termination point on KCS.  So, if that\u2019s a little more helpful.","Art Hatfield \u2013 Morgan Keegan","That is.  Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan & Co.  Please proceed with your questions.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Thanks.  Good evening, guys.","Dave Starling","Hey, Scott.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Hey Scott.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Just wanted to clarify just real quick the guidance on the OR, the commentary on OR improvement.  Is that relative to the 70.9 that you talked about in the slides?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay.  So, okay, great.  When we think about the longer-term move into the 60s, we\u2019d become used to guidance of 100 to 150 basis points a year.  Is that still a fair expectation going forward, or given the real significant improvement in margins the past five years, is that just a tougher hurdle to meet going forward?","Dave Starling","Well, as you get closer down in the 60s, of course it\u2019s more difficult than coming out of the 80s.  But our goal is to continue to improve the operating ratio as much as we can.  Are we going to hit 150 basis points every year?  I don\u2019t know.  We\u2019re going to continue to work the operating ratio down.  If you average it out over time, we should be as good as any of the other railroads.  So, I\u2019d seen that they\u2019ve set goals in the mid-60s, in the high 60s.  But for right now, the goal we\u2019re going to give you is our goal is to be in the 60s.  We may not make it there in 2012, but we\u2019re certainly -- that\u2019s our target.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Okay, great.  And then last thing, Pat, can you give a little bit of color on the new coal business that started in January and how big of an opportunity that is, how should we think about modeling the volumes and revenue there?","Pat Ottensmeyer","It\u2019s a longer haul opportunity, it\u2019s going to have a, let\u2019s put it this way, we serve eight coal plants, this is the ninth one.  And it\u2019s not one of the larger ones, but it\u2019s a longer length of haul.  So we\u2019re not in a position to disclose the contract terms or the specifics, but it\u2019s certainly going to have a nice impact on our revenues and volumes for 2012 and beyond.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Can we just say that one of out nine, that\u2019s almost 10% growth just from that contract?  Is that a fair way to think about it within coal?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I would say it\u2019s not one of our larger contracts.  So it\u2019s a long haul, but the tonnages are maybe not up to the level of some of the others.","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Got you.  Okay, thanks for the time, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Market.  Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Sorry, I apologize, I'm playing with my mute button over here.  Real quick on two things.  Number one, strength in the outlook for consumer and industrial, I know that\u2019s a fairly broad category.  Could you just give any or some color around why you're seeing an uptick in the strength of that, the outlook for that in 2012?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Paper, appliances, some steel.  We\u2019ve had a couple of steel facilities, metals that are -- have expanded their capacity on our network.  We\u2019ve got some new steel investments driven partly by the automotive growth in Mexico that are coming online.  So it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s just also -- that\u2019s where we\u2019ve seen, as I mentioned, 26% year-over-year improvement in cross-border.  So, this is being driven by a lot of that near-sourcing that we\u2019re talking about and just the general increase in trade between the US and Mexico.","John Barnes \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay.  And then my second question, last year you provided a fair amount of specifics around the operating ratio improvement.  I think you started off the year kind of [gutted] to 100 to 150 basis points improvement.  I'm just curious as to why the change in verbiage around that, why not more specifics around the magnitude of that improvement.  Is it cost concerns or is it, you know, it\u2019s kind of [gutted] to a level now where it becomes harder to see incremental improvement in it?","Unidentified Company Representative","I think our track record is good enough that you're going to see continued improvement.  We haven\u2019t set a three to five-year goal.  We had set this goal previously.  We\u2019re down in the hump with the rest of the group.  We\u2019ll continue to improve the operating ratio.","John Barnes \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","All right, very good.  Thanks for your time, guys.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.  Please proceed with your question.","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar","Yes, thanks.  Other than price improvements, what operating initiatives do you have in place to continue -- already noted an impressive operating ratio trajectory, I assume, continuing to drill long haul, and is there any low-hanging fruit left after this 10 percentage points of progress?","Dave Ebbrecht","This is Dave Ebbrecht.  And that\u2019s -- low-hanging fruit, I would say there\u2019s no huge opportunities that we\u2019re going to see very large incremental improvements on.  What it takes is a lot of little opportunities to create more efficiencies all over our network.  We continue to standardize the network on both sides of the border.  This creates a lot of car utilization efficiencies as well as locomotive efficiencies.  We constantly look for efforts around fuel conservation, that\u2019s also producing some big dividends.  But mostly keeping a balanced network while we\u2019re growing is going to create more scalable efficiencies than we\u2019ve seen in the past.  And so we continue to see our scaling well below the revenue growth with our cost.","Mike Upchurch","Keith, this is Mike Upchurch.  One other thing that we\u2019ve talked about over the last year is leased equipment and looking at selectively converting that to owned assets which may also help us continue to drive costs down.  We\u2019ve got a little higher percentage of leased equipment, and with our better financial profile, can put our balance sheet and cash flows to use there to help reduce costs.","Dave Starling","And this is Dave Starling.  We have a lot of opportunity on the intermodal network.  Our trains are not full.  Pat has got a lot of work to do still to fill the intermodal trains out.  That will be incremental, it\u2019ll fall to the bottom line.  So that\u2019s a great opportunity for us.  And I think to be more aggressive in the finished auto market, we continue to work on handling more finished autos through the north, and also through Lazaro Cardenas.","So, we still have a lot of opportunities.  We\u2019re still a growth engine, and I think that\u2019s still going to give us a lot of opportunities.","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar","Sounds like no pressure on Pat there to grow the cross-border business.","I want to ask just perhaps the most elementary question on that, and assuming that continuing to grow long-haul border is going to have a good impact on the operating ratio.  But what\u2019s the greatest obstacle in capturing more of that large cross-border business which the company currently enjoys just a percentage point or so?","Dave Starling","I think the obstacles that we run into are just people who are really unfamiliar with the realities of the way intermodal works cross-border.  I think we\u2019ve done an outstanding job of educating and working with our partners, the major truckload carriers.  But it\u2019s just really continuing to educate people, make them aware of the efficiencies of the cross-border rail movement, making them aware of the investments that we\u2019ve made.","I mean, one of the things that is definitely a factor in driving this conversion is the investment that we\u2019ve made in the network.  We have a world-class, first-class intermodal terminal network cross-border that didn\u2019t exist four, five, ten years ago.  So it\u2019s just really getting people to understand how it works today and get them to understand the consequences and the cost and the time of continuing to move cross-border via truck and the advantages of the rail.","And we\u2019re doing that, our partners are doing that.  Later this week I'm speaking and giving a presentation at the National Sales Kickoff Meeting for one of our major partners.  We did another similar, one of my colleagues here, Brian Bowers did a similar presentation last week at another one of our partners.  So it\u2019s really just getting our partners motivated and excited and shipping away at the market.  And I think we\u2019re all pretty pleased with the level of engagement that we\u2019ve had and just continuing to go after it one bit at a time.","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar","Thanks.  And if I could ask just one more finally, of the full-year 56% growth in cross-border intermodal, can you estimate what portion that\u2019s from convergence, or is this more of the same market share, just more volume flowing in that pipeline?","Dave Starling","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to break it out.  I mean it\u2019s -- because certainly some of the customers that we converted a year ago are growing, so it\u2019s really difficult to break it out.","Keith Schoonmaker \u2013 Morningstar","All right, great.  Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.  Please proceed with your question.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","Yes, thank you.  Congratulations on a fantastic year.  Just one quick question if I may.  I think it was Mike that mentioned that your adjusted EPS of $1.01, that maybe a more representative figure would be to take $0.23 off of that, assuming that the debt retirement costs were not there.  Is that with a 27% tax rate or a 34%?","Mike Upchurch","Well, the 23 really didn\u2019t have anything to do with debt retirement, right?  That really was the changing FX rate and the impact that had on our tax rate.  So we disclosed in our press release that we had kind of a one-time benefit of $0.23, and that was based on an effective rate that was much lower than what the statutory rate is.  If you go back to the chart in the slide on page 31, the effective rate was 27 and our statutory rate is 35.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay.  So that\u2019s how you got to that.  Okay.","Mike Upchurch","Correct.","Anthony Gallo \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay.  You know what?  I\u2019ll leave it at that.  Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.  Please proceed with your questions.","Sal Vitale \u2013 Sterne Agee","Hi, this is Sal Vitale on for Jeff.  So, two quick questions on the labor side.  Number one, on the productivity front, so you\u2019ve had some really nice increases in productivity.  So, how long -- how much longer do you think you can keep increasing the car loads per employee at this mid-single-digit pace, with 6.2% year over year for the fourth quarter?","Dave Ebbrecht","This is Dave Ebbrecht.  That\u2019s really hard to quantify.  I think we still have a lot of in-train capacity that we can absorb, as we have had a lot of new train starts with our startup business.  But we also have other trains that are getting full in force and other new train starts.  So, the law of averages here will say that, you know, we\u2019ll see some stair-stepping up of that measurement, and it just depends on how quickly we grow.","Sal Vitale \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.  Is it fair to say that next year is probably going to be a slower gain than 2012?","Dave Ebbrecht","I think that right now we\u2019re still growing within our train sizes, and I think that will continue to grow at a pace that\u2019s commensurate with how we\u2019ve been growing in the past.","Sal Vitale \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.  And then just shifting gears over to the incentive comp side.  So there was a $6 million increase in the fourth quarter.  How do we think about 2012?","Unidentified Company Representative","From an incentive standpoint?","Sal Vitale \u2013 Sterne Agee","Right.","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, the $6 million was really just moving into higher level payout for the year, and we trued that up for the full year.  A little difficult to guess at this stage of the year after less than a month what incentive comp might be for the full year.","Sal Vitale \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.  And then just the last question, I guess thinking about the salaries line in total, should we think about it growing at some percentage point plus over what the volume growth is?  Or how do we think about that line item?","Unidentified Company Representative","Well, I think we\u2019ll stick to maybe some of the guidance that we gave on cost inflation and try to maintain headcount levels well below our volume growth and let you do the math on that one.","Sal Vitale \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay, very good.  Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Brad Delco with Stephens.  Please proceed with your question.","Brad Delco \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Good evening, gentlemen.  Thanks for --","Dave Starling","You're from Stephans, Brad?","Brad Delco \u2013 Stephens Inc.","That\u2019s right, in Arkansas.","I guess one question, on the guidance you guys gave on the various commodity groups, did you build anything in?  I imagine nothing from Savage that sounds like even if that got ramped up, that\u2019d be 2013.  But any export coal in that coal guidance for double digit, and how should we think about laying that on if that is in your guidance?","Unidentified Company Representative","I guess the way I\u2019d answer, Brad, is we\u2019ve, you know, we build our outlook based on -- largely based on customer specific that -- have a little bit of risk in there and if the risk factor could be met by a number of these opportunities, and we sort of try to balance it out.  So, I think we do have something in here in the back half of the year for export coal.","Savage -- let me just clarify one thing.  The crude oil opportunity and the movement of crude oil over our network to Port Arthur is not completely dependent on Savage and the big Port Arthur crude terminal that we announced our partnership with.  There\u2019s a lot of crude oil opportunities that moves in unit trains or in smaller blocks to other refineries, and we are moving some of that.  So, again, we\u2019re already seeing some of the crude oil opportunity come to fruition.","The bigger project which we\u2019re still very enthusiastically pursuing with Savage is going to take some time to build, once we get contracts, then there\u2019s a licensing, permitting process, and then the construction process of the big terminal there, and that\u2019s probably going to take nine to 12 months.  So that\u2019s going to be a 2013 and beyond opportunity.","Brad Delco \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Got you.  And I guess next question is just a clarification.  The 3.5% inflation, was that just comp and benefits, or should we think about that percentage in general x fuel?","Mike Upchurch","Well, I answered -- this is Mike Upchurch -- I answered the question specific to comp and benefits.  I think if you looked at the overall inflation, we\u2019re probably looking somewhere in that 3% range.  X fuel, who knows what fuel is going to do for the year?","Brad Delco \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Exactly.  Yes.  And then last, just to kind of clarify a point, not to beat a dead horse, on the OR, but with the buy versus lease decisions that you guys have already made, I think you identified 40 basis points or so of margin improvement.  Is that -- when did that kind of start, or has it started yet?  Or should we think about that being sort of a given for \u201912?","Mike Upchurch","That was -- we did talk about that on a prior call.  That was a full-year impact.  It was primarily derived from the purchase of some locomotives under lease which we completed in the September timeframe, so we would have seen a small benefit in 2011, but a larger benefit in 2012.","Dave Starling","But Brad, we\u2019ll have more opportunities like this in the future that I would say are not currently baked into plan.","Brad Delco \u2013 Stephens Inc.","Got you.  Okay.  Well, Dave, congrats on your recognition for being Railroader of the Year.  No one\u2019s mentioned, so I figured I might as well.  And if that\u2019s the case, yes on a great year.","Dave Starling","Thank you, Brad.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Neal Deaton with BB&T Capital Markets.  Please proceed with your question.","Neal Deaton \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Hey, thanks.  I\u2019d like to echo what Brad said.  Congrats to you, Dave, and congrats on a great year.","Dave Starling","Thanks.","Neal Deaton \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","I wanted just to see, I don\u2019t think you mentioned this, what\u2019s -- can you quantify like the total revenue and\/or car load impact of the three little items that you mentioned in your press release that fall under the chemicals and petroleum group, which explain why it was down, one was cost, needed to fulfill an obligation on the rail, then you had a closure, can you quantify that at all, what the revenue impact was there, what would it have been or (inaudible) had these things not occurred?","Pat Ottensmeyer","No, I don\u2019t think we want to get terribly specific down to the customer level, Neal.  But it was -- all of those factors combined and the timing of those factors was different for each one.  But that clearly drove the results for the quarter, and the softness, the weakness that we saw heading into the end of the year.","And I think in the third quarter call -- one of the reasons that we wanted to call this out is because we were watching our chemical business very closely heading into the end of the year thinking that this might be, you know, if there was a red flag out there, if there was a metric or an indicator that was telling us that we were heading into a downturn, that\u2019s where it kind of appeared to us it might be.","And then the point of the analysis in the presentation would show that based on what we\u2019ve seen in the first few weeks of 2012, it really seems like there were other things going on.  And of course, in the case of plant shutdowns and maintenance and those types of things, we knew those were hopefully blips in the quarter that would work through.","But as recently, toward the end of the year, we were having conversations with a lot of our major chemical and plastics and petroleum shippers just to stay close to them and see what was going on.  So again, the short story there is we don\u2019t see the weakness that we saw at the end of the year really signaling that we\u2019re heading to any kind of a downturn.  And in fact, in the first few weeks of the year, it\u2019s picked up pretty nicely.","Neal Deaton \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay.  That\u2019s a good answer.  And then just one or two housekeeping questions.  You all mentioned, I believe, that once you did your refinancing, your interest rate I believe is around 7.5%.  Is that kind of a good proxy number to use for 2012 until you do any more refinancing?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Well, I think that number actually would be negatively impacted by the fact that the 13\u2019s were outstanding most of the year.  So if you took the 13\u2019s out that we paid off at December, you\u2019d expect that number to be even lower.  Then any refinancing that we would be able to complete would further push that number down.","Neal Deaton \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay.  So the 7.4 was -- okay, [in closing].","And then, I know this is hard because of the exchange rate, but any kind of tax guidance you could give for next year at all in the effective rate?","Mike Upchurch","I was hoping that we would get through this call without that question.","Certainly we\u2019ve had a history of using the Central Bank of Mexico\u2019s forecasted exchange rate, which is 13.1, and if that\u2019s where the exchange rate ends up for the year, it could push our tax rate above the 35 statutory rate.  It honestly could put it as high as 40.  But again, that\u2019s a non-cash issue for us.  We will at some point become a cash taxpayer in Mexico, and we do have some thoughts and ideas that we\u2019ll continue to pursue that could mitigate some of that volatility.","Neal Deaton \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay.  I appreciate that answer.  Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from the line of Scott Nichols with Bishop Rosen.  Please proceed with your question.","Scott Nichols \u2013 Bishop Rosen","Yes.  Here\u2019s a question for Pat.  Pat, if -- as and when the administration gives the go-ahead to build the pipeline from the [Tarzans] and to the Gulf, from day one when construction starts, how many years do you estimate it would take to build it?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Well, I have no idea, Scott.  I mean, that\u2019s such a big wildcard and there are people who are a lot closer to this topic and a lot better information than I do that -- including a lot of the customers that we\u2019re talking to, potential customers down in the Gulf Coast who are asking the same question.","Scott Nichols \u2013 Bishop Rosen","Okay.  Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.  Mr. Haverty, I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Michael Haverty","Okay.  I think that concludes the call.  Everyone, farewell, and thank you for joining us.","Operator","Thank you.  This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the Company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the Company\u2019s Form 10-K of the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC. The Company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP could be found on the KCS Web site, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, you may begin.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thank you and good morning everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings call. If you look at page four, you\u2019ll see the line-up, which I think is familiar to everyone. Jeff Songer, Brian Hancock, Mike Upchurch and Jose Zozaya, is on the phone as well this morning.","Let me begin my comments with slide five. As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.12, which compares to $1.20 per share last year, which represents a 7% decline from 2015. Revenues were $604.5 million, a 4% decline from last year. Excluding the impact of lower U.S. fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue and the further weakening of the Mexican Peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 1% lower than last year. Volumes were down by 4% from last year.","Our reported operating ratio for the quarter was 56.9, which is 170 basis points higher than last year. However, this includes the impacts of some one-time cost events, including higher detour expenses due to flooding in South Texas and service disruptions in Mexico, which, as we\u2019ve stated in our press release, had an adverse impact on revenues.","In addition, those disruptions had a negative impact on cost performance during the quarter as well. In spite of this deterioration in quarterly operating ratio, we feel very good about our overall cost performance during the quarter.","Later in the presentation, Jeff Songer, will talk about some of the efficiency initiatives that are underway, and Mike Upchurch, will get into more detail about what we\u2019ll refer to as our normalized cost performance. Just to give you a bit of a preview, this normalized cost performance is demonstrated by looking at our year-to-date operating ratio, which as you can see from the last point on slide five, improved by 230 basis points from the adjusted or comparable operating ratio last year to 65%.","Among other things, this year-to-date view shows our operating ratio performance on a basis, which smooth out the impact of timing or events that would have a more pronounced impact on the results in any given quarter. Again, Mike, will walk you through this in greater detail in a few moments.","Moving onto slide six, I wanted to briefly remind you of the recent guidance which we previously provided, and show you that we are on track with that guidance. Last quarter, we told you that we expected to see sequential revenue growth from the first half to the second half of 2016 and we are confirming that view at this point; and that we expectd to see mid-single-digits sequential revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016.","As you saw on the previous slide, we generated sequential volume growth of 5%, which led to revenues growing by 6.4%, sequentially. We are also confirming our previous guidance regarding second half 2016 automotive volume growth and our overall capital spending targets for 2016.","With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer.","Jeff Songer","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. Beginning with slide eight, velocity for the quarter of 27.8 miles-per-hour improved 10% over prior year, while Dwell for the quarter of 24.1 increased 6% versus prior year. Factors impacting Dwell were the July bridge outage in Rosenberg, Texas, which restricted cross-border traffic flow. The border terminals of Sanchez in Nuevo Laredo and Laredo were impacted by this event.","Compounding this outage were service disruptions in Mexico during the month of July, which caused multiple days of outages across the network. All major terminals in Mexico were impacted, while terminals in Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, already congested by the earlier Texas Bridge Outage were affected further. Current Dwell has shown improvement from the elevated levels that we saw between late-July through mid-September, and we look for this metric to return to more normal levels through Q4.","Moving to the operations overview on slide nine, focus continues on our biggest cost drivers of labor and fuel. Currently, 5% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status. Overall headcount for the quarter was down 1% versus prior year, as Mike will review in later slides. 12% of our locomotives across the system are in storage.","Fuel management programs, as outlined in prior earnings discussions continue and we have gained another million dollars in fuel efficiency during Q3. Year-to-date, we are about 75% complete with the technology installations in the U.S. with Mexico installation work, slated for 2017.","Effective recrew management continues with year-to-date reductions of 49%, while over-time management provided an additional $2.4 million in savings for the quarter versus prior year. One other item to note is the completion of a mechanical in-sourcing effort that was finalized during the quarter and went into effect on October 1st. This represents an approximate $5 million in ongoing annual cost savings. We will recognize these benefits starting in Q4.","Moving on to capital project highlights. I would like to provide a quick update on PTC. First, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous ongoing effort by all of the groups involve in this project. We plan to have a first operating sub-division in PTC revenue service in Q4, and have an aggressive implementation schedule in 2017 and 2018. 2017 will be another heavy investment year for PTC and capital spend will begin to reduce thereafter.","Construction work at the previously announced WTC\/Watco SLP fluids terminal both ground during the quarter. Design work for support facilities for the Ford and BMW automotive plants at SLP is underway. Work at the Sasol support yard facility continues and is on schedule for our late 2017 completion.","Finally, Sanchez Yard classification tracks are on schedule to complete by year-end. This will allow additional handling of trains at Sanchez and will ease some pressure on other terminals in the network, while continuing to facilitate cross-border traffic. Additional classification tracks and mechanical facilities at Sanchez will be complete by the end of 2017.","I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock.","Brian Hancock","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on page 11, where you can see, our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and up 1% excluding currency and the fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year.","Our Chemicals & Petroleum business had a record quarter with 1% year-over-year growth in revenue. Our carloads in this segment were up 4%, primarily due to shipments of fuel oil as a customer in Mexico had a disruption in production, which was partially offset by strong growth in our plastic segment. We continue to see strength in this line of business as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region grow their shipments globally.","Our Industrial & Consumer business remain slow with year-over-year decreases of 6% volume and 6% revenue, with half of the revenue decline driven by fuel and the foreign exchange. This business segment continues to be negatively impacted by softness in our metals and paper segments. These businesses are experiencing stiff global competition impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long-term. This weakness was somewhat offset by strength in our other carload segment.","During Q3, our Ag and Mineral business saw decrease of 1% in carloads and revenue growth of 3%, driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We continue to see the benefit of the additional equipment serving this important business unit.","Our overall cross-border business showed strong growth of 7% for the quarter being led by a record breaking quarter in our automotive business and solid growth in cross-border Ag and Minerals, and the Chemical and Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendixes on page 31 and 32.","Our energy business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in crude and frac sand. Our coal business had lapped some of the lowest numbers from last year and slightly higher in Q3. Overall, energy carloads were down 7% and revenue was down 15% versus prior year.","Intermodal volumes were down 5% with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by our L\u00e1zaro cross-border and L\u00e1zaro inter-Mexico business. We\u2019re seeing good growth in our cross-border franchise and non-franchise business, which more than offsets any general weakness in the overall U.S. market. The intermodal business was also negatively impacted by the service interruptions earlier in the quarter as customers made the decision to use trucks that augment their third quarter shipping capacity.","We are optimistic that these lines will return as the current improved service bolsters customer confidence, moving into 2017. With all of the automotive plants being back online, our automotive volume increased 14% but was impacted by a negative mix, which kept our revenue growth adjusted for fuel and FX at 4%.","One note is the impact of a new move we are now making from railroad to Corpus Christi area, which is driving down RPU. This is a very good piece of business with good overall length of halt. But given the way we account for the move, it has a negative impact on RPU.","In Q4, we\u2019ll see one new facility come up to full production and another facility begin production in November. We\u2019re also seeing strong volumes at the ports, both import and export volumes. And KCS is well positioned to serve our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.","From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close at the positive rate, myear-over-year. Excluding the large customer contract from last year, which will remain unchanged in 2016, our overall core pricing came in at mid-single digit levels. Intermodal remains that market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we\u2019re confident in the value we\u2019re providing and the customers will continue to return to the railroad as we move into 2017.","On slide 12, we have provided a fourth quarter year-over-year outlook for each of the industry segments. As you can see, we have a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 90% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in the Intermodal as well as the return to some of our automotive parts business versus 2015. We\u2019re seeing slightly higher coal shipments year-over-year as we discussed on our last call. And the Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a focus area for investment.","We\u2019re already seeing increased shipments of LPGs into Mexico. And KCS believes we\u2019ll start to see the refined products business ramp-up beginning in Q1 2017. We are meeting with our customer to ensure that our plants meet their expectation as the law begins to be implemented. We\u2019re also seeing some market volatility as refineries in Mexico have maintenance windows, which may impact volume in the month ahead. And we\u2019ll continue to provide updates as we know more about the expected roll-out and implementation of the new law.","The automotive business we expected to grow as our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. As we\u2019ve mentioned before, by 2020, Mexico will provide over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 50% of this production will be added between the years 2016 to 2020. We\u2019re investing in those projects that will enhance the fluidity and capacity to effectively service this important segment.","The Ag and Minerals business should have a good quarter based on record harvest we\u2019re experiencing this year. And we believe our Industrial and Consumer segments will continue to see fierce competition, in both paper and steel into 2017. Overall, we\u2019re upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we\u2019ll continue to make strategic investments, focus on providing our customers with a consistent product that has reliability they can count on as they create their shipping plans into next year.","We continue to focus our efforts in adding reliable capacity and fluidity for all of the growing businesses. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Brian, and good morning everyone. I am going to start my comments on slide 14. As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%. The peso depreciation had a $12 million negative impact on revenues while declining U.S. fuel prices negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. Fuel surcharge revenues declined $32 million due to lower fuel prices and from rebasing customer contracts.","Adjusted operating ratio increased 1.7 points to 66.9, primarily due to incremental costs incurred during the quarter that relate to year-to-date true-ups for incentive compensation and expenses related to flooding and service interruptions during the quarter. I\u2019ll discuss those details in the next few slides.","Third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $1.12 per share was down 7% from last year, while adjusted EPS was also $1.12 and down 7%. More details on the reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS can be found on slide 27 in the appendix.","On slide 15, for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016, carloads declined 3% and revenues 5%, mostly from foreign exchange impacts and lower fuel prices. Reported operating ratio improved 290 basis-points. Despite a challenging operating environment requiring us to manage a number of extraneous events, adjusted operating ratio improved to healthy 230 basis-points, largely the benefit of $50 million in fuel excise tax credits, more than offsetting and incremental $14 million in higher incentive compensation. Reported EPS increased 4%, while adjusted EPS increased 3%.","Turning to slide 16, not only as 2016 been a challenging year from a carload and revenue perspective, but we have experienced increases in out of pocket costs related to various flooding related events in all three quarters, increased environmental expense, and higher incentive compensation expense.","Higher incentive compensation expense for all management employees caused $14 million increase from the targeted 100% payout level to a higher projected payout for the full year 2016. Including, both the $9 million true-up for the first-half of 2016 and $5 million in period, increased in the third quarter. Despite those increased costs, we have improved our adjusted operating ratio by 230 basis points in the nine month period ending September 30, 2016.","On slide 17, this reflects foreign exchange and U.S. fuel rates for the first three quarters of 2016, and projections for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation, currently expected to be 13% below 2015 levels during the fourth quarter.","As a reminder, we saw similar depreciation of the peso during the third quarter, which negatively impacted our revenues by $12 million. Fuel prices are expected to be approximately the same year-over-year, and thus fourth quarter could be the first quarter we haven't seen negative fuel impacts on revenue in quite some time.","Turning to slide 18, third quarter operating expenses declined $7 million or 2%. Key drivers of the decline and expense included the excise tax credit, the benefit from the depreciating peso, lower headcount and better labor productivity. Offsetting those declines were higher incentive compensation, depreciation, detour costs from flooding, and higher environmental expenses.","Let me provide a little bit more color on the excise tax credit. During the quarter, we generated $16 million fuel exercise tax credit; a continuation of the credit we began realizing during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, this credit was established for qualifying transportation companies in Mexico and represents the beginning of transition to world market prices, which we still expect to occur in 2018, and perhaps earlier.","While we still don\u2019t know whether the credit will be available in 2017, the good news is the 2017 draft budget proposal presented to the Mexican Congress does reflect continuation of the credit in 2017. Congress is expected to approve the budget sometime during the fourth quarter.","As a reminder, we include this credit and operating expense as it directly relates to our fuel expense, which includes the applicable excise taxes we have always paid on fuel purchases. And accordingly, is included in the operating expense section of the P&L.","We have included the credit as a separate line item in operating expense to provide investors transparency and clearly see the year-over-year impact of the credit rather than netting it with fuel expense. We actively manage fuel purchases on a daily basis on our cross-border traffic to ensure we are purchasing fuel in the most economical way to produce the lowest possible operating costs.","Our ability to utilize the credit is dependent on a variety of factors that include having sufficient taxable income and sufficient withholding and income tax liabilities to utilize the credit as there is no carry-forward provision available to us. We currently expect to generate approximately $15 million in additional credits during the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide 19, compensation and benefits expense went up $15 million, largely due to $16 million of increased incentive compensation. During the quarter, we increased our accruals for incentive comp to higher payout percentages. The $7 million increase is due to 2015 payout percentages being accrued at 50%, and increasing the payout to higher achievement levels in third quarter 2016.","When increasing the projected payout in 3Q, we also recorded true-up adjustments for the first six months to increase our accruals to the higher payout percentage, which contributed an additional $9 million year-over-year increase. For the fourth quarter, to give you a little guidance, we currently expect incentive compensation to be $7 million higher than the fourth quarter 2015. And again, we were accrued at a 50% payout level in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Wage inflation is still running in the 3% to 4% range, and contributed to another $4 million year-over-year increase in compensation expense. And as you can see in the bar chart, headcount continued to decline by 1%, contributing to $4 million of savings, along with various other productivity improvements.","As Jeff mentioned, we continue to have crews per load in the U.S., resulting in year-over-year savings. And we experienced a slight reduction in overall headcount.","Turning to slide 20, fuel expense declined $11 million, primarily due to peso depreciation, lower fuel prices, lower volumes, and better efficiency. As you can see in the bar chart, fuel price declines, both in the U.S. and Mexico, and our average consolidated price per gallon declined from $2.24 in the third quarter last year to $1.99 in the third quarter this year.","And finally on slide 21, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy the past 18 months, we have grown third quarter volumes 19% since 2007, while the rest of the Class Is have experienced declining third quarter volumes on an aggregate basis of about 6%.","We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. And projected capital expenditures, as Pat mentioned for 2016, continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million. Finally, in May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. And a little more than halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased about 60% of the authorized amount at an average of $89.63 per share. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thanks Mike. I\u2019ll just close with a few comments to provide an overall assessment for the quarter. Obviously, we continue to be in a challenging business environment as evidenced by our year-over-year declines in overall volumes. While the weakness is most evident in energy related business, we did experienced year-over-year volume decreases in five of our six major business lines during the quarter.","The good news is we are seeing sequential improvements and once we cycle through some dramatic reduction in coal and crude oil revenues that began in early 2015, we should start to see some volume growth returning.","In spite of some unusual cost items, which occurred during the third quarter, we feel very good about our overall expense management and productivity trends. We feel that the year-to-date view of operating ratio improvement is a more meaningful indicator of those trends.","Jeff detailed a few of the specific areas of focus, but there are many more that we are working on across all departments in the Company that will make us more cost efficient and productive in the years ahead.","I gave a presentation at a recent rail shippers conference at which I described the near-term business outlook as tepid which literally means lukewarm or lacking enthusiasm. When volume growth returns, and we are confident that it will at some point, the expense controls and efficiency initiatives we are currently working on should put us in great condition to begin using terms like incremental margins; again, which have been noticeably absent from our vocabulary for the past few quarters.","Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth outlook based on the key growth drivers that we see impacting the KCS network in the years ahead. You\u2019ve heard us talk about these growth drivers before. But just to reiterate; there are new auto plants in Mexico; new petrochemical facilities being built in the U.S. Gulf Coast; growth and capacity at L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas; and continued growth and market share gains in the cross-border intermodal markets will be the primary catalyst for KCS in the years ahead.","So with that, I\u2019ll open the mic for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Couple of regular questions for you. Pat, you said that the budget for the excise tax credit looks like it's going to be approved in the fourth quarter. Does that mean that there is no chance of going to market pricing on fuel in 2017 itself? And also, do you have an update on the antitrust investigation that new regulator has been conducting? I think we should be coming till the end of the window by ways they should be showing at work?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I\u2019ll answer the second question; first, no update, still ongoing. The first question, we don\u2019t know. At this point in time, there is nothing that we can say with certainty about acceleration of market price movements. But as we\u2019ve described in great detail last couple of quarters, this movement in excise tax is a way to effectively get us to, we think, get us to the same outcome. And we expect that to continue in 2017 as well.","Ravi Shanker","As a follow-up, I think you\u2019ve mentioned mid-single-digit price increases. I think the last couple of quarters you had mentioned something in the order of just shy or 4%. Is that a similar level for this quarter as well?","Brian Hancock","Ravi, this is Brian. We feel very comfortable with the mid-single-digit range that we\u2019ve talked about over the last few quarters. So, we\u2019re pretty much in the same range.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","So, I wanted to ask you about the broader volume outlook. If you\u2019ve had, obviously, you\u2019ve had noise in the past couple of quarters with weather issues, teacher strikes, things that would be presumably hard to anticipate. But it seems that there is maybe been a bit of loss of momentum in the Intermodal side, or I guess lots of visibility to the growth in that segment. And so I just wanted to see if you could comment on impact of weak peso and how big an issue that is? How you think we might transition, how much volume growth you might get maybe in 2017 in the Intermodal segment?","Brian Hancock","Absolutely, this is Brian. What I would tell you is we feel very comfortable with the Intermodal space. As we\u2019ve discussed over the last couple of quarters, one other big shipping company has made a decision to move to an all vessel water solution, out of the Pacific into Houston area. And so, that impacted our L\u00e1zaro cross-border and L\u00e1zaro inter-Mexico business. That\u2019s primarily the decline you see from an Intermodal perspective.","All the other segments are growing and we feel very comfortable that we competing well. As we said before, we will not chase the lower trucking pricing that\u2019s out there. We\u2019re going to continue to provide the value that we do, both in security and in reliability of those shipments. What I would tell you is across the board though, we feel very comfortable that sequentially we\u2019re going to continue to grow. It\u2019s just slower than, I think, everyone would like it to be. But it\u2019s above what we expect. And we\u2019re continuing to manage the cost structure and the infrastructure investments according to that.","So obviously, the investments in supporting the additional automotive continue; the investments in the energy segment; the refine products, all those pieces are still in place. So the story is, it's pretty much the same except for that one Intermodal move that took a rail move and made it into a lot of move into these areas.","Tom Wadewitz","So, I mean, is there any reason to think that move would -- some of that business would come back eventually, or is that simply Panama Canal driven, and wider canal you don\u2019t get it back. And then, I guess, I don\u2019t know if you have any broad thought on what ballpark we enter volume year-over-year in fourth quarter, or even in looking into even 2017. Obviously, you\u2019re not going to know exactly. But what\u2019s the right ballpark for volume growth in fourth quarter next year?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, I\u2019ll answer the first one. We believe that it's very difficult for the shipping companies to maintain the pricing that they have put in place, which is below variable costs on that move into Houston. And so, we feel very comfortable that, at some point, that\u2019s going to find the right solution as the best task into Mexico, and into the U.S. From an overall guidance perspective, on revenues, obviously we\u2019re not give any guidance, but we continue to staying with the point that we\u2019re going to continue to see growth in all of the segments, and we\u2019ll continue to move forward with that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. So, Brian, I want to come back to comment you made about your automotive growth, because your units were up quite a bit. But adjusted for FX, I think we\u2019re seeing top-line expansion of about 4% for automotive. So, can you talk to us a little bit more about that mix impact? And I think you alluded to some accounting issues there too.","Brian Hancock","Yes, it\u2019s a -- thanks Brandon, that\u2019s a good question. What we have is we\u2019ve added a couple of short haul moves. One of those includes an overall length of haul that\u2019s very, very good for the business. But there is a piece of the business in the U.S. that goes from the border into the Corpus Christi area that is a short haul piece that have a pretty significant impact on length of haul. And as length of haul is shorter on the KIA business in Monterrey that also has an impact.","And so what I would tell you is some of this business that we\u2019re changing from long haul deeper into Mexico into a long haul move that spreads across both railroads, you see that impact on length of haul in the U.S. side. The KIA business from Monterrey continues to be -- is always going to be a short haul. And that impacts RPU but is very good source from an overall perspective on profitability.","Michael Upchurch","Brandon this is Mike. Just to clarify that. I mean when we do the carloads, we\u2019ll report them separately for Mexico and separately for the U.S. So, what Brian is referring to here is we picked up some north bound into the U.S. that picks up as one carload as well to the Mexican carload. And it's great business for us because we extended the length of haul.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay, appreciate the clarification. And Pat, you brought it upfront incremental margins. As we look into \u201917, if things remain tepid, what can you guys do from an operational standpoint, or maybe this is a good question for Jeff. Should we be thinking that there is still margin potential in the cost structure?","Jeff Songer","I\u2019ll take that one, this is Jeff. I\u2019ve tried to outline a couple of things, and gave visibility around fuel, for example, on the initiatives. We\u2019re not able to complete with the installs in the U.S., and we have the whole Mexico network to install fuel technology. And I\u2019ve provided some numbers on savings on fuels throughout the year here. So, I view those things are going to continue.","And I am confident that they will continue, I think, on the headcount side. You\u2019re continuing to see productivity. The noise we saw in the quarter with the disruptions, as mentioned, certainly drive some additional operating expense. And so on a more normalized quarter, I think you\u2019re going to continue to see those improvements.","Headcount for me as we\u2019ve talked with all the hiring in 2015, you\u2019re starting to see us kind of lapse that comps. So, I think in Q4, you\u2019ll continue to see the trends that we saw here in Q3. The one outlier in headcount would be the in-source effort I talked about, so very good financial move for us. But I think that will add about 250 and 300 hedge to our internal numbers, so that will skew just the outlook. But that\u2019s the reason that you\u2019ll see that in Q4.","But, all in all, very pleased with how things are progressing. I feel that we\u2019re still fairly early in the productivity improvements, especially in Mexico as we\u2019ve got the headcount right sized. We\u2019ve got the growth opportunities ahead of us. So, I think the productivity focus will be there for us.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","And I\u2019ll just add to that. Again, we don\u2019t normally talk a lot about year-to-date results on a quarterly earnings call. But if you look at the year-to-date operating ratio performance, given flooding we had in the first quarter, flooding we had in the third quarter, some unusual expense headwind in the absence of volume growth, a 230 basis point improvement in operating ratio, really says a lot about the success we\u2019ve had.","And then just on the operating side but across the Company in expense controls. And we will get back to a period when we talk about volume growth again, and I am certain that we will. I don\u2019t know when. But if you go back to your notes around a couple of years ago, not just us but all the railroads, we\u2019re talking about incremental margins; again, a term that\u2019s lost its relevance here lately. But the focus on expense control and operating efficiency, I think, will really pay-off when we start to see volume growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee","Mike may be a question for you on the tax credit, just wanted to get some color. I am guessing you guys probably have internal target of what you think the benefit might be based on what\u2019s in the language in the budget for next year. Just want to get a sense. Should we be thinking about it in the rough order of magnitude of what we saw in \u201916? Or does it change materially?","Michael Upchurch","Well, I mean, we have to cross the first hurdle, which is obviously formal approval, while it\u2019s in the draft budget. We need Congress to approve that to be certain of it. And then it\u2019s going to depend on the volume of business from the volume of business and the volume of fuel that we end up purchasing. But all things being equal, you could expect something of similar nature if your volumes were the same that you have in 2016.","Chris Wetherbee","And is it, so it is volume variable on a scenario where you had volume growth due to auto or maybe Intermodal, bouncing back as it could has some variability, up or down, I guess?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, so if business grows, then there is an opportunity for that credit to grow. And I was just trying to give you a year-over-year, if things were flat in terms of gallons of fuel that we purchased, then you would expect the similar credit, and that could go up or down, depending on what happens with volume.","Chris Wetherbee","And then just a quick follow-up on the peso. Just wanted to get a sense. When you talk to customers in Mexico and we\u2019ve seen some significant volatility in the peso over the course for the last quarter. Do you get any sense of longer term changes in behavior from customers in Mexico? Just wanted to get a rough sense of what this shorter term volatility original volatility, of causing or maybe not causing with customers attitude to how they do business in Mexico?","Brian Hancock","Chris, this is Brian. I would tell you that for the customers in Mexico, as they look at the peso, that impacts them significantly. And many of them have asked us price in peso and we have done over the last 18 months. There is still a significant portion of our businesses that is priced in dollars because it\u2019s more of a global basis. But we watch that as they do as well. And we\u2019ve tried to do everything we can to make sure that each other understand where the peso is, how it\u2019s impacting the business.","And overall, I would say there is an awareness, I would say there is no one out there saying, boy, I want to take action in this way or that way. As has been suggested in other places around surcharges and things like that, that\u2019s really not the space that we\u2019re in. I would tell you that customers are very aware of the impact as the peso devalues or increases in value. So, it's just one of the things we stayed very close with them on. But most of the other business that\u2019s in dollars is going to stay that way simply because of its global nature.","Jeffrey Songer","And just to add-on to that, Chris. What we haven\u2019t seen, and I\u2019ll use the grain business maybe as the best example. And I think this is maybe what you\u2019re getting at. We haven\u2019t seen customers shift sourcing decisions because of the weak peso.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, that\u2019s exactly -- that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much for the time guys, I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please go ahead with your questions.","Jason Seidl","Pat, we\u2019re not going to let you off that easy.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I didn\u2019t think so\u2026","Jason Seidl","My first question, I think Tom touched on the top-line so I\u2019ll touch on more on the bottom-line look at things. How should we think about the operating ratio as we go to the fourth quarter, because you guys soon to be getting hit with everything this year, and every quarter, whether it was, weather or just the flooding, or bridges being out or comp catch up. It seems like 4Q is going to be a cleaner number as I knock on, what is I\u2019m saying then here. How should we think about that when we\u2019re looking on sequential basis?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Well, we\u2019re not going to be specific about guidance, as you know. But I think the thing that we want to emphasize and may clear to you guys is that we\u2019re working really hard to try to continue to develop this cost initiatives, efficiency, productivity initiatives. And we think there is room for further improvement in operating ratio, even in the absence of volume growth. We\u2019re not going to get specific about guidance. But as you said, we knock on woods that we don\u2019t have extraneous events, like floods and other things that are totally outside of our control.","If we see a quarter where we don\u2019t have those kinds of influences, then we think we can see some continued benefit of these initiatives. Jeff mentioned the in-sourcing of the mechanical function in Mexico which will create a bump in headcount for the quarter. But net effect on operating income and profitability will be positive. We\u2019ll start to see that in the fourth quarter. And in the absence of events that we don\u2019t control, we think there is room to improve the operating ratio in the fourth quarter and beyond.","Jason Seidl","I guess my follow-up is going to be on Mexican Energy Reform. You mentioned that the Watco fluid facility broke ground here in the quarter. When do you think that\u2019s going to be up and running and fully functional? And can you give us any insight for other facilities that are similar to that that might follow around the energy reform?","Brian Hancock","Yes, this is Brian. I would tell you that the facility broke ground this last quarter. We expected to be up in running by the second quarter, probably by the end of second quarter 2017. But I would tell you the Howard facility, actually came on line this week. And so it is now connected to the railroad. We\u2019re not shipping there. They\u2019re not able to receive shipments. But the fact that it is on line, means that they will be prepared to start. We\u2019re seeing products here over the next quarter, so, probably first of 2017. There are number of other facilities, primarily in the variable space, where we will pull a railcar in, it will go direct to truck that are being contemplated and being considered. But overall, people are focused on that that center of the country area. And those are the two primary facilities, other than temporary facilities, that might be from rail to truck.","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. The next question today is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","So Mike, I wanted to just try, just on the near term outlook again. So, I know last quarter, you provided some sequential revenue guidance. Are you not able to give us any sequential or year-over-year revenue guidance for fourth quarter?","Michael Upchurch","No, I think, Brian gave some visibility as to what we expect on the revenue side by segment. And we did give some cost information around year-over-year increases in incentives. And you can probably draw a quarterly savings from what Jeff talked about with respect to the maintenance in-sourcing. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to keep our commentary at those three levels.","Brian Hancock","And I think going back to what I said earlier, Scott, second-half, we\u2019ve said in the second quarter, second half would be better than the first half. Obviously, we\u2019ve got a good start with the third quarter. I think sequentially stronger. But generally there is some seasonality in this business that shows the fourth quarter coming off the third quarter pacing?","Scott Group","And then on the coal side, so we typically, at least the last few years, we\u2019ve seen a big drop off in coal volumes for you guys, third quarter to fourth quarter. Just given where NATGAS prices are and the weather that we\u2019re seeing in Texas, right now. Can coal stay stronger for longer into the fourth quarter? And do you have any update on the long-term plans of those Texas plants?","Brian Hancock","Second part of the question, we do not have any indication on the long-term liability of plants. You\u2019ll have to work with our customers on that. We do believe that the coal volume right now is kind of stabilized. We don\u2019t see a large inventory build, like we saw in the past where people had really taken their coal reserves down to zero, and we had to replenish that.","So, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that we\u2019ll stay where we\u2019re at, and continue to move effectively with the facilities that we do support. But I don\u2019t think there is going to be any wild swings down or up at least that we can see in the near-term future. Obviously, it\u2019s hot in Texas and that\u2019s good. These are facilities that come on from a variable kilowattage perspective. So, we think that\u2019s going to continue. But, overall, we don\u2019t see a big surge in demand over the next quarter.","Scott Group","So just unclear, at 330, give or take NATGAS, you don\u2019t think these plants run more full-year, you think it's going to stay more just seasonal?","Brian Hancock","Yes, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been told by our customers. And so that would be the way we would look at it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Good morning. Just I guess I\u2019ll start with my clarifying one. Is the incentive comp increase tied solely to the stock moves, or is it related to performance? Just wondering what drives that $7 million increase going forward, and is that a sustainable $7 million?","Michael Upchurch","Ken this is Mike. The increase in incentives is almost entirely our annual short-term incentive plan that covers all management employees. And that measure is operating ratio.","Ken Hoexter","Again, so just is that a good placeholder to $7 million, or is that\u2026","Michael Upchurch","Well, I think I gave some guidance that we would expect to see $7 million increase in 4Q incentives in \u201916 over \u201915.","Ken Hoexter","Which was 50%, right, last year and this is now. And then just, if I -- returning to I guess my question on Intermodal and an update on L\u00e1zaro is the second concession open and maybe can you maybe delve into the impact of the strike that you mentioned there was still some backlog. How long does it take to clean up? And what\u2019s the leverage there as you move forward?","Michael Upchurch","Yes, I would tell you the most important piece about L\u00e1zaro is that the facility will operationally be ready in Q4. I think they are planning to open operations in Q1 of 2017. So, the facility is ready to go. There is continued volume that comes in there that we move on a daily basis. I wouldn\u2019t say there is congestion there right now I would just say that it's continued, operations it's the third time of the year, it's the holiday and high retail time of the year. So there is a lot of freight moving into that right now.","But that is the area that we talked about the L\u00e1zaro inter-Mexico and L\u00e1zaro cross-border piece of business that has been off, this year primarily due to the decision of one of our customers to move that freight completely by vessel up into the Houston area. And so that volume is not moving at all through the port. So if it were to move back, obviously, that would be beneficial to us. But again that\u2019s -- they\u2019ll decide that in the coming months and years, how they want to move that freight on an overall long-term basis. But right now, the concession is done. The operations will be ready to move in Q4. And we expect to move volume out of the new APMT terminal in Q1 of 2017.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Konigsberg","Maybe can you just talk, just one point clarification. Just as far as the service disruptions. So you\u2019re completely clear at this point, and there should be zero carryover from costs into the quarter. So, it should be clean. Is that\u2019s the view at this point?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, that\u2019s the view at this point.","Michael Upchurch","There are no further disruptions.","Brian Konigsberg","And maybe can you give an update on the port of Veracruz. So I know you\u2019re connecting your tracks. Where are you, as far as marketing to customers, and do you see that providing some incremental tailwinds?","Brian Hancock","The port of Veracruz is, we believe that all construction and the bypass would be completed by the end of 2017. So, we are seeing more and more business into Veracruz. We\u2019re selling specifically into the automotive space. And we feel very comfortable that we have a good product there right now. We have to hand that over to a partner railroad as we get closer to the port, very close inside the port. But we feel that once that bypass is completed at the end of 2017, we will have a great product for our customers to move into the Atlantic as well, so, very comfortable with the way that\u2019s proceeding, right now. And right now all signs are that that will be completed in December of 2017.","Brian Konigsberg","And if I could sneak one last quick one in. Just on CapEx. So, it looks like it\u2019ll tick-up just a little bit in Q4. Is the preliminary view that \u201917 is going to be fairly flat given PTC remains simply elevated, and then initially the sizeable drop-off in \u201918, that\u2019s the initial plan?","Brian Hancock","Yes, I think that\u2019s a fair assessment there are on a flattish and a dollar perspective. We\u2019ve got Sasol continuing. We\u2019ve got PTC, as I mentioned there, one more heavy. And then it will start winding down a bit after that. So, I think the flattish is a good expectation.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Brian that was a pretty sleek how you sneaked in three questions.","Brian Konigsberg","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Danny Schuster","Good morning. This is the Danny Schuster on for Allison. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on achieving your auto volume guidance thus far this year. Just wanted to dig in a little bit more on that. So, given that you have two new autos facilities that are ramping production in Q4 and Q1. How should we think about auto volumes now in Q4 versus Q3?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I think you\u2019ll, Danny, I think you\u2019ll continue to see the auto volumes move as they have been, as we kind of laid it out. Obviously, the KIA facility will be coming on full swing at the end of the year. So, they\u2019re already producing, but both will continue to ramp up. And then we\u2019ll see another facility come on in November. Obviously, that\u2019s the slow ramp-up, but we\u2019ve described the other facilities. But right now, we feel like our automotive business is doing very well. We\u2019re very comfortable that we have the security and the right type of fluidity and capacity to support them. As Jeff mentioned, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in that space. But not only Q4 but into 2017 and over the next few years, we feel very good about the way the automotive volume is coming forward.","Danny Schuster","And just to clarify from the modeling perspective, in Q4. Are there any carryover costs from environmental and flooding expenses that you experienced in Q3, that we should also expect to see in Q4?","Michael Upchurch","This is Mike. No, you shouldn\u2019t see any carry-over impact on either those events those are behind us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead with your question.","Bascome Majors","Thank you. Cost pressures and incentive comps true-up, they drove your earnings down Q-over-Q this quarter, and that\u2019s typically, you\u2019ll see a seasonal rise. So that was a bit of typical on the downside there. Just thinking into 4Q with 3Q as a base, do you expect that 4Q will break with the flat to down quarter-over-quarter trajectory you\u2019ve seen over the recent years from an earnings perspective?","Michael Upchurch","Well, I think we gave some guidance around fourth quarter that you should expect to see about a $7 million increase over what we had in 4Q of 2015. And again, we were accrued at 50% levels in third quarter and fourth quarter a year ago, and obviously stepped those accruals this year.","Bascome Majors","I was asking more so, just from a very high level on EPS basis, 3Q was well below typical seasonality in the trend from 2Q. I am just curious if we should look at that as a base and maybe see some above seasonal uptick versus the flat to down trajectory you see in EPS typically in the fourth quarter?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","We\u2019re not giving any EPS guidance. So I think we\u2019ll stick with the commentary we gave about fourth quarter. I guess, I\u2019d just go back to looking at the year-to-date results as opposed to the quarter, because the quarter did include some things, some catch up things, some unusual things that going back to your comment about normal seasonality that you wouldn\u2019t expect to see in a normal third quarter.","Bascome Majors","Just to follow up to try to put a closer number to some of the incentive comp expectations as we go into next year. I mean, can you tell us in dollar terms, what a 100% target payout for cash you would look like on incentive comp? And maybe percentage terms, how far you are tracking above normal for the payout this year, now as you true things up?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","No, we\u2019re not going to really get into all those details. And we\u2019ll leave commentary as we provided it on the slides.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","So, first question was on 2017. I know you\u2019re not going to provide specifics today. But, Pat, in your closing comments, you expressed your continued optimism about the long-term growth in the business. And so I was just wondering, from a high level, especially when you think about lapping some of the irregular cost items that you\u2019ve outlined this year. What\u2019s your confidence the business that we\u2019re in a position to return to double-digit earnings growth that we\u2019ve seen historically?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Wow. You kind of knocked that one in there. You\u2019re seeing that we\u2019re paying attention here. It\u2019s really going to depend on when we see volume recover. So we keep thinking that we\u2019re lapping and going through the cycle on some of the coal and crude oil movements, and they should start to look better. And that just haven\u2019t happened. I think we\u2019re not going to give guidance about timing of when we expect the volume growth to return. But we think it\u2019s going to happen.","When you see the investments, new plants, the market share opportunity that we have in the Intermodal, the new terminal at L\u00e1zaro, the petrochemicals, autos, all the things you\u2019ve heard us talk about, we will see volume growth return. And when that happens, I think you\u2019ll see the benefit of the cost and efficiency work that we\u2019re doing right now. But is that going to happen in 2017? I don\u2019t know.","Justin Long","Okay, fair enough\u2026.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","So, not a very satisfying answer, but that\u2019s our answer.","Justin Long","I had to try. And then as a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask about the competitive dynamic of L\u00e1zaro versus Manzanillo, right now. Could you just speak to how the two compare in terms of service and trends at times? And how do you think that opening of the second concession at L\u00e1zaro could change that competitive dynamic?","Brian Hancock","Yes, this is Brian, Justin. I mean, I think the most important piece, when you think about the competitive dynamics of Manzanillo and L\u00e1zaro. L\u00e1zaro was the only port that has a direct rail connection into the U.S. and into the rest of North America. So, the addition of the APMT terminal is going to be pretty significant. If you look at what the government has said, they\u2019re looking to double the initial size of the facility. They want to double the capacity of the port. We feel very, very comfortable. But that port is going to continue to grow.","Now, when you think about competitiveness into the inter-Mexico area, that\u2019s what we see the competition right now, the truckers and the low price. There is about, when you think about the difference between rail and truck, there is about 60% of the volume goes truck, about 40% goes rail. We\u2019re hoping that that continues to improve as people look at the security of the rail, the number of places we can get to on the fluidity. Obviously, Jeff talked about the big investments that we\u2019re making. It is important when you have an Intermodal product to be fluid and consistent, and that\u2019s where we have to management team, we\u2019re spending all of our time, because we realized that the growth opportunity there is significant, not only out of L\u00e1zaro but into the U.S.","So, from a competitive perspective, we know the value that we bring. We understand how the price is. We believe that it's going to continue to -- the tailwinds are going to our way as we continue to improve our fluidity. But right now, we feel like we\u2019re very, very competitive in the space that we\u2019re at. But there is also this dynamic of the vessel operators that we\u2019re still dealing with and it\u2019s a global issue. It\u2019s not just Mexico. It's not just North America. And so, as the vessel operators sort out probably over next 12 to 18 months, I think we\u2019ll continue to see that at L\u00e1zaro.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Thanks for getting me on here, just two quick ones, both for Brian. So you mentioned Veracruz, December 2017. Feel like it\u2019s going to go forward at point in time. We\u2019ve heard a lot of back and forth in terms of the progress. It seems like land ownership there that was a pretty big hurdle. This is reasonably positive update. I was just hoping if you could give us more clarity as to, as anything have happened to get this moving forward, because you do seem to be pretty positive about this being complete at end the next year?","Brian Hancock","You\u2019re absolutely right, Brian. Land acquisition was a key. There was a particular piece of property. But we knew that this would probably be a question that would be asked. And so we did some research just prior to the call over the last week and half just to make sure we understood how it is progressing. And we continue to feel very comfortable they\u2019ll be completed and we\u2019ll have access to that line at the end of next year. So, you know everything that we know. But we feel very comfortable with the land acquisition issue that was there on that last four kilometers has been cured.","Brian Ossenbeck","Other quick one was just on metals. Primary metal volumes have been down more each quarter as you go through this year. I would thought, we\u2019d see some relief by now given all the favorable steel trade cases of the past year, is this really tied to any specific plants that\u2019s been shutdown as a more destocking? I think Brian you actually mentioned this was not in area you saw of particular strength through this year -- end of this year and into next.","Brian Hancock","Yes, I would agree with that. What I would tell you is, the steel industry continues to be under a ton of global pressure. There is inventory in a number of areas, not only within Mexico but also in the U.S., and the rest of North America. We do see one ray of light is that the amount of high grade steel necessary in Mexico and the plants able to support that could potentially help us maybe into the last part of next year. But again people are looking at that industry and it is extremely competitive. And we just haven\u2019t seen the fall-out that you would particularly expect seeing all the court cases that are out there, but I think that we\u2019re going to hold our own. Our customers seem to be investing. And so we think it\u2019s going to end up being a very positive space. But right now, we just don\u2019t see any relief over the next or while.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And those would be high strength steel plants in the U.S. going cross-border?","Brian Hancock","Potentially, and also potentially coming inside of Mexico. So, I mean, both sides.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Schneeberger","Just curious, your comments, in mid-September Ford announced shift of U.S. small cars production to Mexico. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about that and how that maybe incremental to opportunities you\u2019re looking at in the coming years? Thanks.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","It\u2019s certainly a great opportunity. We are, as Jeff mentioned in his comments, we\u2019re in the design phase of that facility. Those small cars are good for us. We\u2019re able to move them, both south and north, because they export them, not only into the U.S. and Canada but also around the globe. So, you\u2019ll see those cars go both into the Atlantic-Pacific. We feel that\u2019s very positive, and we\u2019re heavily engaged in that facility and its construction there in San Luis Potosi.","Scott Schneeberger","And just on the slide 12, Intermodal, as far as -- you have a new comment on there, incremental growth through the new service. I\u2019m clear have we touched on this call or is there something that hasn\u2019t been covered?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","No, we\u2019re just continuing to see other opportunities for ourselves and our customers out of Mexico, and also into Mexico, primarily driven by the manufacturing and the retail environment in Mexico, which seems to be doing very well. So we feel very comfortable with both north and south and out of the port of L\u00e1zaro that we\u2019re going to continue see growth. And we\u2019re looking at providing different services for those customers. But they would be normal Intermodal services, nothing exceptional.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks for the clarification, appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Lipschitz with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","David Lipschitz","Just a couple of quickies. Ford announced that its idling one of their -- couple of their Mexico facilities. Is that going to impact to you at all? Or are you worried that others might do the same with auto sort of seeking out?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thank you, Dave for the question. We do not believe that the impact of those particular facilities, we don\u2019t service those facilities right now. So, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have an impact on us. But, we do see Ford as a continuing customer over the next two years. As I just said that they will continue to grow. As to whether the volumes, from a North America perspective, are going to stay where they\u2019re at, or if we\u2019re going to see some of the other automotive companies tail-off production in Mexico.","We use the publicly available data and the data that our customers give to us. And right now we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re still on the trajectory that we laid out over the last couple of quarters. And by the end of 2020, I mean, we see the facilities coming on next year. In Agulhas, the facility is coming onto next year with Ford and then BMW the next year. So, right now, we continue to see all of those facilities coming on at the same pace that they said, that they have announced. And we\u2019re spending our capital dollars in preparing for that as we\u2019ve said in the past.","David Lipschitz","Just one quick follow-up. The environmental charge, what was that for?","Jeffrey Songer","Yes, that was an ongoing environmental remediation clean up that we had -- we continue to work on and have over the past few years. With the work we\u2019ve done, we discovered a little incremental remediation work needed. So, we\u2019re booking to that anticipated remediation charge.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ottensmeyer, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay, just a couple of quick comments. I realize this was a bit of a noisy quarter. But you guys will write the headlines that I think the headline that we have in mind is this fuel excise tax situation is a good thing. For us, it accelerates the benefits of deregulation and then makes us I think more competitive long-term with truck, particularly Intermodal. The focus on cost control and efficiency is we\u2019re very, very pleased with that and that is producing real productivity improvements that we\u2019re seeing today. And when volume growth returns, I think that will put us in great position. And have to close with the long-term growth drivers are still very much intact. And finally, I know Tony Hans that is out there. I really like Jake Arrieta against Rich Hill tonight. So we\u2019ll close with Go Cubs. We\u2019ll talk to you in 90 days."],"12343":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q4 2013 Earnings Call January 24, 2014  8:45 AM ET","Executives","David L.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company which could materially differ from the events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2012, filed with the SEC. The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David L. Starling","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Kansas City Southern's fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. Joining me on this call this morning are Dave Ebbrecht, Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer; Pat Ottensmeyer, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Mike Upchurch, Executive VP and CFO; and joining us by phone is Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, our President and Executive Representative in Mexico.","Start with KCS's fourth quarter review. We're very pleased with our fourth quarter results. Revenues were up 8% in the quarter, which we feel was outstanding in light of being hit fairly hard by weaker-than-expected coal volumes, which I'll touch on again in a few minutes. Revenue growth in the quarter was especially driven by our grain business.","As we had forecasted would happen, KCS's grain traffic was quite strong throughout the quarter, causing grain revenues to increase 50% over the weak comps of a year ago. Export grain actually grew by 106% in the fourth quarter and cross-border Intermodal revenues by 64%. These 2 business segments were the principal drivers of KCS's overall fourth quarter cross-border revenue increases by 30% over last year. Both continued to perform well in the first weeks of the year.","KCS's fourth quarter operating ratio came in at 68.1%, which was a 1.4-point improvement over a year ago. Given the volumes in the quarter being lower than projected and some weather-related operating challenges in both Mexico and the U.S., we are very satisfied with our operating performance.","For the quarter, the company's adjusted earnings per share was $1.03, 13% higher than the fourth quarter.","The next page, the update for the full year 2013, our final scorecard in how we performed versus our guidance. In terms of volume, we had forecasted mid single-digit growth. With our reported 2% growth for the year, we obviously came in below that guidance. Coal was the main culprit with volumes of that commodity down 8%.","In addition, despite spectacular numbers in the fourth quarter, grain volumes were down 5% for the year caused by the impact of the drought on our grain business throughout the first 9 months of 2013.","While we ended the year quite happy with the pricing environment, I have to say that coal, again, had an impact on our total core pricing. As other rails have discussed, rail inflation calculations embedded in some coal contracts have impacted pricing in that commodity area. When this is added to the rest of our same-store pricing, it takes our total number below the mid single-digit guidance but still greater than inflation.","Pricing for KCS as well as for the other rails continues to be generally a good news story. We hit our mid single-digit revenue guidance, coming in for the year 6% higher than 2012, and solid double-digit revenue growth in Automotive and Intermodal helped drive hitting the revenue targets.","In addition, we did improve our operating ratio in 2013, coming in at 68.1%, 1.1 points better than the adjusted 2012 number.","And before leaving 2013, I'd like to remind everyone that this was the year that we attained the important financial objective of becoming investment grade. Immediately after achieving investment-grade status in the second quarter, we took advantage of historically low interest rates to undertake a major restructuring of our corporate debt. As a result, we doubled the company's weighted average maturity from 7 to 14 years, and we went from the Class 1 railroad with the highest weighted average coupon to having the lowest one in the industry.","In 2013 alone, we reduced our interest expense by $20 million, and since 2009, have taken out over $93 million of annual interest expense.","Becoming investment grade has made KCS a stronger company with a balance sheet that provides us with a lot of flexibility going forward.","On the next slide, 2013 is history. We've now turned our full attention to 2014. Before giving you a view of how we see the year developing for us, let me say we've taken long and hard looks at our forecast for the year ahead.","The first thing that becomes clear to me after working on our forecast is that there has been no loss of conviction among this management team that KCS has a superior long-term growth horizon. We're as confident in this as we were a year ago and as we were 2 years ago.","So with that, let me start with the volume growth, which we expect to follow in the mid single-digit range. We feel positive about our business growth coming from new and existing customers. That, coupled with not having to drag 3 quarters of wheat grain traffic and that utility coal, while still expected to be lower, won't be the same drag on our business as it was last year. This makes us feel very confident about our volume growth in 2014.","Given what I said earlier about low inflation, which we expect to remain low in 2014, the most accurate guidance we can give is that our overall core pricing will outpace inflation.","In terms of revenues, we are comfortable projecting high single-digit year-over-year revenue growth. Of course, KCS revenues can always be impacted either up or down by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Revenues can also be affected by the timing of the new auto and steel plants ramp up production and when new crude terminal facilities open.","Building these variables into our calculations, we believe our revenue projection is reasonable and very attainable. We certainly expect our operating ratio to improve. When you look at our performance over the last few years, you have pretty consistently seen improvement in our OR in the 1 to 1.5 point range. In fact, over the last 5 years, we have a 1.3 point average per year reduction in our OR. There is no reason you should not see something in that range again in 2014.","This year, we're adding a few new items to our list of guidance. First, total CapEx in 2014 will come in lower than 2013, but we'll still outpace the industry average of 17% to 18%.","KCS is still, first and foremost, a growth company. And we have to ensure that our resources are sufficient to take full advantage of our opportunities.","As such, our 2014 CapEx, as a percentage of revenues, will still be in the 20s, though considerably less than last year's 26%. Dave Ebbrecht will discuss our CapEx plan in a bit more detail during his presentation.","Finally, for the first time, we're providing some earnings per share guidance. For years, we've avoided doing so for a number of reasons. One of the reasons we backed away was due to a significant impact of fluctuations in the peso-dollar exchange rate add on our below-the-line financials. Now after a year of having an effective hedging mechanism in place, which has considerably mitigated the impacts of these swings on our earnings, we feel better about providing a degree of guidance.","Given the reasonably good economic conditions, we believe KCS is well positioned to record good annual EPS on a consistent annual basis. In 2014, we project that improvement to be in the mid teens. Embedded in the chart showing our EPS growth from 2010 to 2013 is the positive impact that restructuring our debt had on significantly reducing our interest expense.","Even though the opportunity to take up further interest expense is limited, we believe that given our abundant business growth opportunities and consistently strong operations KCS is positioned to continue to deliver double-digit EPS growth going forward.","With that, I will now turn over the presentation to Dave Ebbrecht and have a few comments at the end. Thank you.","David R. Ebbrecht","All right. Thanks, Dave. Okay, let's turn to Slide 10. We'll look at our ops leverage graph. We continue to emphasize our consistent ability to control costs here. Our ops costs have scaled well below the revenue growth over the past 4 years, and we'll continue to pursue 40% to 50% incremental margins.","The initiatives in network train management, our terminal efficiency, fuel optimization, capacity enhancements and our equipment utilizations continue to produce greater fluidity, headcount stabilization and a predictable cost pattern.","On Slide 11, our headcount controls continue to be very positive. Our headcount has been largely flat year-over-year with a small increase due to in-sourcing of work in Mexico.","As I've previously explained, we'll continue to see occasional dips in this efficiency metric due to seasonal variations in carloads shipped from quarter-to-quarter as we did in the fourth quarter, but the overall trend will remain positive.","We continue to hire in areas experiencing high growth rates, but most of our hiring is still for attrition purposes. We are also evaluating all contracted services in the U.S. and Mexico, and we'll experience stair-step increases in headcount as opportunities present themselves as financially accretive in the upcoming years.","On Slide 12, our velocity was at 27.8 miles per hour for the quarter [ph]. This was sequentially up over the third quarter.","Dwell was higher than last quarter by 2 hours at 21.9 hours, predominantly due to a mix shift of traffic through Shreveport and Jackson during peak season and holiday shutdowns as Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year hurt the dwell metrics while we shut down in the terminals. Weather also played a role as we had to endure the ice storms after the Thanksgiving startup period.","While dwell and car efficiency experienced slight degradation during the fourth quarter, they are still indicative of a very solid performance and in the range necessary to execute our transportation service plan.","Flipping to Slide 13. I wanted to address the sizable decrease we have had in our maintenance away [ph] capital spend on a go-forward basis.","We're not deferring any maintenance spend. In fact, we have invested so heavily over the last 5 years to bring our mainline to a steady-state level of stability that we have achieved a more cyclical maintenance program. We'll continue to place the same importance on modeling growth, predicting capacity needs, executing a just-in-time approach towards our growth capital investments.","We see those capacity enhancements along the cross-border corridor, the Sanchez and the Nuevo Le\u00f3n terminal complex, and the sidings needed for targeted growth opportunities.","Strategically, we'll continue to strengthen our Intermodal franchise on both sides of the border and invest in key corridor projects to handle the increased volumes of crude that we are projecting in the future. We also invested heavily in rolling stock equipment for auto and Intermodal growth while we continue to optimize the use of our existing fleet.","We are seeing very positive results from our capacity investments as indicated by the consistent performance of our train velocity at 27.8 miles per hour in the fourth quarter while achieving year-over-year record growth numbers.","We look to achieving greater fluidity in the upcoming years with our capacity improvements that will accommodate the significant growth opportunities ahead.","Now I'll turn it over to Pat.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay, good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 15. As you all saw in our press release this morning, revenues for the quarter were $615.6 million, up 8% from last year, and volumes increased by 2% to 543,600 units.","Both of these were record performance levels for the fourth quarter. And just for the record, our revenues and volumes for the full year of 2013 were also both all-time records. Mike Upchurch will review the full year results in a few minutes.","As Dave Starling mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the results for the fourth quarter, especially considering the impact that utility coal had on our overall revenues and volumes.","Our utility coal volumes were the lowest for any quarter since the beginning of 2006. Excluding the impact of utility coal, in other words, if it had just been flat from last year, our revenues and volumes would have grown by 12% and 4%, respectively, during the quarter.","So now, I'll get into a little more detail on the individual business units. First, revenues increased in our Chemical & Petroleum business by 2% on a 4% decline in carloads. The main driver in the volume reduction here was weakness in petroleum shipments in Mexico due to 2 large customers. In fact, these 2 shippers more than accounted for the entire volume decline in this business unit during the quarter.","The first case involved some residual impact of flooding in Southern Mexico earlier in the quarter in October as well as some terminal congestion on the part of our customer, which reduced the level of shipments. This was a temporary situation and, in fact, volumes for this customer are beginning to return to more normal levels in January.","The second case of the utility customer, again in Mexico, which shifted its power generation away from fuel oil to hydroelectric and natural gas, and we expect this weakness to continue for a good portion of 2014.","The only other business that merit comment here is agrochemicals, which was down by about 17% versus 2012, and the explanation is unfavorable comps due to the impact of strong shipments in the fourth quarter of 2012 as we were coming out of the drought. We are seeing this situation continue in the first quarter of 2014.","Moving onto Industrial & Consumer products. Revenues grew by 9% on a 1% increase in carloads. Areas of strength include metals and scrap, which was up 19%, driven by both volume and RPU growth, reflecting some new long-haul lanes for slab and pipe movements; appliances, up 38%, driven by volume growth due to strong housing-related markets and market share gains; lumber and plywood, up 10%, again, reflecting stronger housing and construction markets. These gains were partially offset by lower paper shipments, which were down slightly from last year primarily due to extended market-driven shutdowns at some of the plants we served during the quarter.","Our paper business continues to be a little soft so far in 2014, so we're watching this area pretty closely as we move into the new year as it feels like core demand may be slipping. I'll talk more about the outlook for this in a few minutes.","Moving onto Ag & Minerals, the phrase that comes to mind to describe the fourth quarter is easy comps. What a difference a crop makes in this business. A large portion of the growth in this business unit was long-haul cross-border grain, which you'll see in a minute, also is a primary driver behind the growth in our overall cross-border revenue that Dave mentioned earlier.","I think everyone remembers the drought of 2012 and the impact that it had an our Ag & Min business last year and into the first 9 months of 2013. The story has now run through the cycle, and we expect this business to be strong throughout 2014.","We also saw revenue growth in food products and ores and minerals, albeit to a lesser extent than grain.","Our Energy business unit wins the prize for underperformance this quarter, and that was primarily driven by lower utility coal volumes, but lower crude oil shipments also contributed to this weakness. As I mentioned earlier, utility coal volumes were at the lowest level we have seen for any quarter since the beginning of 2006. The explanation for this weakness includes the earlier than expected seasonal shutdown at one plant we serve in Texas, unplanned outages for 1 month at another plant we serve in Louisiana, and reduced shipments to a third plant that we serve due to derating in anticipation of permanently shutting down one generating unit there by the end of 2015.","Two of those factors are seasonal, and one is permanent, and I'll talk more about the impact on our outlook for utility coal in a few minutes.","Crude oil shipments declined by 8% during the quarter, which is the first time in a couple of years that we have seen decline in this business. Some of the factors driving this decline include shifting supply pattern among refiners, more light sweet crude coming into our service region by pipeline and water, and a shift in the destination for Bakken crude away from the Gulf and more toward the eastern refineries.","In addition, increased pipeline capacity and limited storage availability at one of the terminals we serve in the Port Arthur area contributed to the weakness. We still feel good about the long-term outlook for crude oil. As we have said in prior calls, our longer term opportunity is going to be driven more by the heavy crude coming from Canada, which did increase significantly during the quarter but not enough to offset the decline in Bakken and West Texas. Again, I'll talk more about the outlook for crude in a few minutes.","On the positive side, in our Energy business, pet coke and frac sand business both increased, by 14% and 9%, respectively.","Okay, moving on to more positive news. Revenues in our Intermodal business grew by 18% on volume growth of 3%. The bright spot here, once again, was our cross-border business, where we saw revenues grow by 64% and volume increase by 47%.","As was the case in the third quarter, volumes at L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas fell by about 4% in the fourth quarter. You may recall in our third quarter report, I mentioned that we would continue to have some headwinds in the fourth quarter due to an aluminum shipment for one particular customer that declined significantly over the course of last year. That was, in fact, the case. In removing the impact of this one shipper, our volumes would've been essentially flat to last year. We will be completely through that comp by the second quarter of 2014, but it really shouldn't be a material drag in the first quarter.","I will say that our outlook at L\u00e1zaro has improved as our volumes and revenue are both higher in January by 12% and 8%, respectively. A new call by 3 major ocean carriers and a vessel-sharing arrangement has contributed to this growth.","And finally, our Automotive business continues to show strong performance with revenues and volumes both increasing by 9% and 3%, respectively.","Negative foreign exchange movements caused a 1% reduction in revenues during the quarter.","The growth here was obviously driven by strong North American auto sales, new cross-border business, increased import and export activity at the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. And we will just begin to see the impact of the new auto plants in Mexico in the spring of this year, and they will ramp up to full capacity, accelerating into 2015 and 2016.","Turning to Slide 16. You can see there our cross-border revenues increased significantly during the quarter, with grain being the primary driver of that increase. However, cross-border revenues increased in all of our business units versus last year. At $161 million and 26% of revenues, cross-border revenues were at an all-time high for any quarter.","Moving on to Slide 17. Here, we show full year growth rates for the 5 strategic growth areas, which at 22% combined, is significantly higher than our overall revenue growth rates.","Even with the weakness in the fourth quarter, our crude oil business grew by 51% versus the full year of 2012. These 5 businesses will continue to be the primary growth drivers for the years ahead.","On Slide 18, you can see we are expecting revenue growth in all 6 of our major business units this year, with Intermodal and Automotive continuing to be the fastest growers, both in the double-digit range.","As Dave Starling mentioned earlier, our guidance for 2014 is for mid single-digit volume growth, pricing above inflation and high single-digit revenue growth.","Here are some of the factors that we considered in putting the current guidance together. The ramp-up in production at the new auto plants will occur over a bit longer period of time than we foresaw a year ago. And this will have a ripple effect on other products like steel and plastics.","The opportunities are significant. The plants are built. They're going to be opening soon, but the growth will be realized over an extended timeframe than what we believed a year ago.","We know a lot more about the crude oil business than we did last year and have adjusted our outlook to more accurately reflect permitting issues and capacity constraints, specifically the heating equipment required to handle heavy crude -- Canadian crude in the Gulf region. Again, the opportunity is there but will play out over an extended time frame.","Finally, as we have all been painfully reminded over the last 2 years, coal and grain will always be driven by factors outside of our control, so we've taken a slightly more conservative view in those business units to consider the likelihood of unexpected events.","Our core merchandise business will grow in the single-digit range as we see strength continuing in steel, plastics, petroleum and housing-related products like appliances and lumber. As I mentioned earlier, our paper business has been little soft recently, but our customers continue to tell us that they do not see a downturn over the course of the full year.","We do know that some of the mills we serve were running at very high utilization rates last year, so we may have a bit of an inventory bubble to work through. But taking all of that into consideration, we are expecting modest growth in the core merchandise business this year.","Our Ag & Minerals business is expected to show single-digit revenue growth for the full year. Our grain business will have very easy comps into the first half or 8 months of the year, but we expect it to flatten out as we finish.","In spite of another year of declines in our utility coal business, which will be in the mid single-digit range, we expect positive single-digit revenue growth in our Energy business unit overall as frac sand, pet coke and crude oil will more than offset the lower coal revenues.","As I mentioned earlier, we will see the impact of new auto plants in Mexico in our volumes beginning in the second quarter, and that business will ramp up over a 2- to 3-year period. Expectation for North American auto sales are for growth of about 4% to 4.5% in 2014, and we will grow faster based on the impact of these new plants.","Intermodal growth will be driven primarily by truck-to-rail conversion in our cross-border business, which we feel has a lot of runway to grow for a very long-term horizon. As fast as we've grown this business, we are still barely at 3% share of the available market, which we estimate to be nearly 3 million trucks crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in markets that we can serve.","Moving on to Slide 19, we want to spend a little more time reviewing our crude oil network and providing a bit more detailed update on our outlook for that business.","In the past, we've talked a lot about our plans for the development of a Port Arthur crude terminal, and we continue to work on that project. In fact, nothing has really changed regarding our view of that commercial opportunity, and we remain confident that we will proceed with that projected build out.","That said, we have no additional information to share with you at this time regarding our proposed partnership on that project. We continue to work through permitting and design and construction details.","The main purpose of Slide 19 is to show you that our crude oil opportunity is more than just Port Arthur. And, in fact, we are working in several new opportunities throughout the Gulf region. In addition, as I mentioned before, we believe that our longer term crude opportunity is going to be heavy Canadian crude moving into the Gulf Coast region.","One of the factors that has proven to be somewhat of a constraint on our growth has been the installation of heating equipment to unload the crude at the destination terminals. Over the course of 2014, we will see that equipment installed at some of the destinations shown on this slide, which will significantly improve the ability of these terminals to handle Canadian crude in much larger quantities.","On Slide 20, I just want to touch briefly on the energy reform legislation that has been passed in the Constitution of Mexico last month. As I'm sure you are all aware, the Mexican Constitution has been amended to open energy markets to foreign investment and competition. The key point I want to make is that while we believe this reform could create significant new opportunities over a long term for KCS, it is way too early to know what the specific laws and regulations will be and how that might impact our revenues and volumes in the near future.","The timing and magnitude of any new opportunities is very much an unknown at this point, and we have nothing in our 2014 plan or guidance related to Mexican energy reform. We will provide additional guidance as the legislature defines the rules and regulations of this reform over the course of the next several months.","Finally, I'll wrap up on Slide 21. We feel good about the economy in both the U.S. and Mexico, and we are confident that we will grow faster than the rate of GDP growth shown on this slide. I've already covered the business unit outlook pretty well. The pricing environment, as Dave Starling mentioned, is still positive, and we see core pricing increasing higher than the rate of inflation.","Our long-term growth outlook is still very positive. I've covered most of these points already, but I haven't touched on one, which is the longer term outlook for growth in plastics, specifically the ethane and propane base production increases that have been announced in our service region. We are working on several exciting new business opportunities in that space and hope to have more details as the year progresses.","With that, I'll turn the presentation over to Mike.","Michael W. Upchurch","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'll start my comments on Slide 23. And as Pat previously covered, our fourth quarter volumes grew 2%, and revenue grew 8%, the result of favorable mix of traffic, which comes primarily from our Ag business.","Our operating ratio improved 1.4 points to 68.1%, representing a best-ever fourth quarter for KCS.","And our incremental margins were a strong 48% in the quarter, consistent with some of our prior comments and guidance of 40% to 50% incremental margins.","Reported EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.03, 24% higher than a year ago. But on an adjusted basis, we had $1.03, which represents a 12% increase over a year ago and represents a combination of strong operating income performance and continued improvement in our interest expense resulting from our debt restructuring this year.","Operating income increases provided an approximate lift of $0.14 per share versus a year ago, while interest provided another $0.03 per share versus fourth quarter of 2012.","Offsetting those increases in EPS was a higher adjusted tax rate of 37% versus 33.6% in 2012. Several factors contributed to this higher tax rate, including the Mexican government's decision in December to eliminate planned 1% income tax rate reductions that were scheduled to be implemented in 2014 and again in 2015. And that required us to revalue our deferred taxes at higher rates than what we had previously recorded.","This increase in others contributed to an approximately $3.5 million increase in tax expense in the fourth quarter, and coupled with tax credits of $2.7 million a year ago, caused an approximate $0.06 per share negative impact versus a year ago.","And we've provided more details in the Appendix for those of you interested in additional information related to our income taxes.","Turning to the full year on Slide 24, our carloads grew 2% while revenues grew 6%.","Our reported operating ratio increased from 2012 due to the $43 million credit we recorded a year ago related to the elimination of the deferred liability in the second quarter.","So on an adjusted basis, our operating ratio improved 1.1 points to a record 68.8%, and that's a rate of improvement that's been consistent with our prior year trends.","When adjusting for the elimination in the deferred liability in 2012, our incremental margins were an extremely good 56%. Reported EPS was $3.18, down 7% from 2012 largely due to debt retirement charges recorded in 2013.","On an adjusted basis, EPS grew 12%; $0.40 of our growth came from operating income increases, $0.12 came from interest expense reductions that totaled $20 million year-over-year, and then offsetting those increases were higher adjusted income tax rates of roughly 1.5 points, which contributed to an $0.08 decline in EPS.","Again, for further information on our tax rate, please refer to the Appendix information. And just to give you a perspective going into 2014, we would continue to expect an ETR of approximately 35% that does exclude any kind of FX changes.","While the FX rate was relatively stable in 2013 and did not have a significant impact on our Mexican tax obligation, we are pleased with the effectiveness of our hedge strategy. We've included a summary of that for you in the Appendix materials.","Turning to Slide 25. We've provided details of our reported to adjusted earnings per share, just to help you understand the details of debt retirement costs and the FX gain that we recorded in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 26, our operating expenses increased 6% in the quarter, below our 8% revenue growth but above our volume growth of 2%, which is largely related to the length of haul increases, particularly in our cross-border grain business.","Key contributors of the expense increase are included in the table on the right side, and I'll provide more details on each of those expenses in the next few slides.","So on Slide 27, let me start with compensation. We saw compensation expense increase $6 million, about 6% year-over-year. The increase was driven by higher volumes and wage inflation.","Our headcount increased by 115, or less than 2%, and when excluding the impact of the in-sourced track maintenance contract that we've been discussing all year, which contributed to 57 FTE, our headcount increased about 1% year-over-year, continuing our trend of maintaining headcount growth below our volume growth.","Turning to Slide 28, purchase services increased year-over-year. Higher track repairs and maintenance reflected higher repairs -- slightly higher repairs and the impact of a fourth quarter 2012 reimbursement for crossing closures, which was about $1.5 million, contributing to some negative comps on a year-over-year basis. Higher trackage rights are primarily related to the significant increases in cross-border grain that Pat covered earlier. And other increases were primarily volume driven, including lift costs in our Intermodal business.","Turning to Slide 29. Equipment costs decreased $2 million year-over-year due to the $4 million decrease in lease expense as a result of a second quarter purchase of locomotives that were previously under lease. This purchase did drive an increase of $2 million in depreciation expense, which I'll discuss in a couple of slides.","That reduction was partially offset by higher rental expenses and some lease turn-in costs that we accrued during the fourth quarter of 2013.","Turning our focus to fuel on Slide 30. Fuel expense did increase $8 million; $5 million of that increase from volumes and $3 million from price. The increased consumption was due to a 5% growth in our GTMs, representing both our volume growth and length of haul increases, again from our cross-border grain trades.","Price increases of 3% also contributed to our fuel expense growth. On a consolidated basis, you can see on the bar charts our fourth quarter of 2013, price per gallon was $3.08 compared to $2.99 in the fourth quarter of 2012.","We did see price declines of approximately 4% in the U.S. However, that was offset with price increases of 11% in Mexico as the Mexican government continued to escalate fuel prices to get closer to world market prices.","On Slide 31, let's turn our attention to depreciation. We saw a $6 million increase due to the increased asset base resulting from our higher capital expenditures and our equipment purchases to support our new growth opportunities.","Additionally, the second quarter of 2013 acquisition of locomotives that had previously been under lease contributed $2 million to our [ph] increased depreciation. But as I noted a couple of slides ago, we saw the offsetting reduction in lease expense.","And finally, let me cover our capital structure priorities on Slide 32. First and foremost, we continue to be bullish on our future opportunities. And accordingly, we'll continue to invest our operating cash flow into network and equipment investments as Dave reviewed earlier.","We do expect to see a slight decline in the CapEx to revenue ratio into the low 20s this year. Secondly, while optimizing our balance sheet is largely complete at this point, we did during fourth quarter and we'll continue early this year taking some smaller steps to further optimize our capital structure. And we will certainly continue to purchase assets under lease that will help improve not only our operating ratios but also our EPS.","And just for a little color, since we started this program back in late 2011, we've achieved roughly 70 basis points of OR improvement in a little over 2 years. But I think it's also important to know that we've consistently said there is no silver bullet in buying these assets since our lessors have to be willing to sell the equipment to us and at prices that are economically attractive. Otherwise, there isn't a benefit to our shareholders.","We continue to believe this will be a 5- to 8-year journey as the optimal time to purchase that equipment typically is at a time that is close to lease termination where penalties are minimized.","But as with the refinancing of our debt, we'll continue to evaluate this and are certainly willing to absorb any kind of onetime early termination charges to the extent those transactions make sense.","We did complete the redemption of our 6.125% notes in the fourth quarter, and we'll redeem the remaining 8% notes next month.","Finally, we're also completing the restructuring of our credit facilities to support the launch of a commercial paper program that we are scheduled to do in February, and that will continue to allow us to access alternative funding on the most economical terms.","And finally, turning to our dividend. Our yield has certainly declined below the 1% level that we initiated the dividend at a couple of years ago. We are continuing to evaluate that. But those are board decisions, and we will keep you apprised accordingly of any decisions with respect to the dividend.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave Starling.","David L. Starling","Okay, thank you, Mike. Before opening it up for your questions, let me say again that we feel good about our fourth quarter and the full year 2013. Revenues were solid. Our operating ratio continues to improve in the range we have achieved over the last 4 years.","In addition, for the fourth consecutive year, KCS delivered double-digit earnings growth in 2013, and we look forward to making it 5 years in a row in 2014.","Finally, revenues through the first few weeks of 2014 continue to be strong and are, again, being driven primarily by cross-border volumes.","These volumes should remain strong during the year since we now have a good grain crop. And as production ramps up at the new auto plants, the majority of that business we've been awarded for the new plants is long-haul cross-border.","Pat also discussed Mexican energy reform. While I echo what he said, there is certainly nothing in our forecast related to energy reform, nor have we as yet have a timeline for when we might see development. Still, there would appear to be a number of opportunities for KCS in the future.","Everything from transporting refined products cross border, moving frac sand from U.S. sources into Mexico and eventually moving crude and tank cars would seem to be an opportunity for us at some point.","And lastly, it appears that we may be nearing a point where there will be some more clarity around the much-discussed large-scale increase of ethylene and polyethylene production capacity in the Gulf area.","Again, any revenues for KCS are still a ways off, but we expect that during the year, we may get a better understanding of what the growth opportunity might be for us.","So please, stay tuned. It should be another interesting year. Now we'll be happy to take your questions. And as we stated earlier, we'd like to keep it to one question and one follow-up. So with that, I'll turn it over to the...","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dave or Pat, can I ask you to comment a little bit more on this sort of 5-year view? Because we talked a lot about '13 as being a bridge year. You got 12% growth in earnings it seems like this year. So kind of mid teens isn't really sort of the ramp, I think, that folks were thinking was going to happen this year. So can you talk about how that growth rate should evolve? Does it accelerate? Or is mid teens and double digit about what we should expect kind of a longer term steady state?","David L. Starling","Well, I'll make a couple of comments and then turn it over to Pat. Some of the commodity groups like automotive, until the plants were actually completed and we could finally get a number from them on how long it was going to take for the ramp-up, there's just a little more lead time than we had thought. For instance, just one auto plant that will not start really producing any significant volume until March, but then when you look at '15, that production doubles. So we're finding this at several of the plants that there's just a longer startup, there's more testing, there's more product inspection, quality issues for them to finally get up to their full production. It's not the fact that the market's not there. That just takes longer. And certainly on the crude by rail, with everything that's going on today, [indiscernible] in the derailments that they've had and all of the press and potential regulation, people are a lot more nervous, and the permitting process seems to be taking longer. We certainly don't see the desire to move the crude by rail stopping. In fact, the meetings we've had in Washington have been we recognize that we, as a country, have an opportunity to become energy self-sufficient. And the Bakken crude and the Canadian crude are a big part of that. So we don't see that there's going to be any change in direction, but it's going to take a little more time. We're going to have to modify some tank cars. There's definitely going to be a little more regulation, but no one is saying we shouldn't move this in tank cars within the space that we're working in. So some of these things may take a little bit longer. Our Intermodal is still moving at the pace we expected it to. We're very, very pleased with the grain. But there's just been a few factors that are outside of what we control. Again, the long-term projection is there, but it may -- we may stairstep into it over the next 2 to 3 years. Pat?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","No, I think that's right. As we've talked in the past, the -- and I mentioned in my comments, the auto production and the auto business has a big ripple effect in terms of plastics and steel and those other commodities that we move that are connected to auto plants. So as the auto forecast ramps up slower than we might have expected a year ago, it has an impact on other commodity groups as well. And I agree with Dave, I think in terms of the crude oil, we still feel that, that opportunity is there and could be significant in the Port Arthur region and the Gulf region. It's just going to take a little longer than we had hoped and thought to develop.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, do you -- Pat, do you feel like you can increasingly use this low operating ratio as a way to stimulate demand, so use price a little bit? Does that matter at all? Or is this really just the underlying organic growth rate, and when it comes, it's going to come, and the pipeline looks good. But price isn't really a factor?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","No. We're not -- we don't see price as a factor to drive demand. It's really the pipeline is -- I mean, it's a very good pipeline. We've got a lot of new business opportunities to talk about the plastics. Dave mentioned the plastics capacity. Still unclear about the timing and magnitude, but there's just a lot of stuff taking place in our service region. So it really is more of a timing issue and a ramp-up, and this may be a little bit longer, steady ramp-up then the stairstep that we might have expected a year ago.","David L. Starling","And just a follow-up on your question, Bill. If we went to the auto plants today and dropped our rates, it wouldn't cause them to change their production in the auto plants. I mean, they've got a market today they want to ship to, but they've got to go through all their testing -- all the quality testing that they do, and then will -- they've already told us how many they'll produce, and they've already told us that they will double. That's their plan. But it is going to be a '14 and '15 issue.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just the reverse make a difference if you raise the price? Is there no effect?","David L. Starling","We've already given them a price. I don't know if...","Operator","The next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping you could help me bridge the revenue and OR guidance for '14. If I think about somewhere in the high single-digit revenue growth range and assume 150 basis points of OR improvement, it's implying contribution margins of roughly 50%. But given that your strongest growth is still expected to come from cross-border Intermodal and cross-border Automotive, I would think that more of the profit would fall through to the bottom line given the longer length of haul on this business. So I was wondering if you could walk me through this.","David L. Starling","This is Dave, Allison. I'll take the OR question. One thing is we're continuing to grow and ramp up our Intermodal business. We are creating new train starts. So we have more service offerings than we've had today. We've now got our route over Jackson to Chicago that we didn't have in the past. And in order to be truck competitive, we need to create some new train starts to have the service we need to be competitive. So there is going to be some stairstepping of train starts and a little bit more cost. And then we start to fill these trains out incrementally that falls to the bottom line. So it's a little bit of a chicken and an egg in the next 12 to 18 months.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And I guess my follow-up question, do you think -- some of your peers are expecting similar revenue and earnings growth in '14, albeit some of that comes from share repurchases on the EPS side. But historically, you've really posted outsized growth relative to the industry. And given that we're, I guess, theoretically beyond the bridge year, I would think the growth gap would be widening and not narrowing? So as we think about 2014, is this sort of another bridge year? And are we -- is it a function of pushing out growth to '15 because of the timing of autos and crude? And can you return to something on the 20% EPS growth range in 2015?","David L. Starling","I'm not sure that we can return to 20%. We had a lot of interest taken out the last 4 years. So today, what we're doing is continuing to work the opportunity. I think what you're seeing is the same answer that I gave Bill earlier. The auto plants, when they first gave us their projections, they gave us what their plant could produce. So those are the plug-in numbers we use. Now the reality is when they sit down with us, they give us their ramp-up over 2 years. So we were somewhat disappointed that they weren't going to start out at a higher production, but it's something that we can't control. So that's been a little bit of the issue going from what we thought was going to be a little heavier '14 on autos, and that would be a true statement that, that will bridge out into '15. The crude by rail, a little bit different. You had -- we think we're going to be more of a heavy crude play because of being in the Gulf. That is just taking longer to get those origins in Canada, and it's taking longer to get the permitting done in the Port Arthur area. And if you saw in Pat's map, there's a couple of other areas there that don't require permitting because they're already in the chemical patch and they already have facilities. But it's going to take several months for us to get the connection built in and get them online. So they're there, but they're just taking a little longer than we thought they [ph] would.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I guess, Allison, on the revenue side, if I think about the plans that we've prepared and then kind of the way we look at some of these opportunities, auto, crude, some of the other things we've talked about, I would say we haven't really changed our estimate or assessment of the ultimate size of those opportunities. It's really the timing and the rate of ramp-up that has changed. So I just don't feel like we feel that the size of the prize, so to speak, is any smaller. It's just going to be a different trajectory and, perhaps, a longer trajectory to get there.","David L. Starling","But it's still going to be double-digit EPS.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess, I've probably a few around the same theme here. But when you -- Dave, when you think about the guidance, it does seem that -- so I understand you're not going to have as much interest expense reduction benefit to earnings. That makes sense. That's been a nice incremental driver. But what about on the OR improvement side? Is that also a bit slower? Because even as you've had slower volume growth in, let's say, the past 2 years, you've still done a great job in productivity and margin expansion. And, I guess, if Pat's comments are accurate about still seeing some acceleration in 2015, I guess, the 20% earnings growth number doesn't really seem that aggressive given your kind of your track record and history and also given the idea that the margin improvement could be better than 100 basis points a year. So I know it's kind of the same theme, but if you could give some more thoughts around that.","David L. Starling","Well, we're going to continue to work on the operating ratio. I mean, you know in the past, we've kind of given the standard guidance of 1 to 1.5. It's been a combination of some interest savings, but our -- lease savings, but also operating improvement. I think we will continue to improve. We've been very reluctant to put a number out there. We may very well do much better than 1.5, but right now, the guidance that we feel comfortable giving is the 1 to 1.5 points. I think that is going to be doable. Could we do better than that? Possibly. But that's the guidance that we feel comfortable with today.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And is there -- I think you said that -- maybe you can clarify and make sure I understand right. Is there room for an acceleration from the mid teens when you look at 2015? It would seen that, I guess, if your -- there's a timing issue, and you could see acceleration in revenue that, that earnings could accelerate in 2015 as well. Or is that just, you got a bunch of moving parts, and that's just not realistic anymore?","David L. Starling","Well, I think it would depend. Intermodal, as we get the new train starts, Tom, could actually expand faster than we have in our plan. Usually when you start new services, you can have quicker conversions. The auto production in Mexico could be greater than we think it's going to be in '15. All we know is what they tell us today. The crude by rail could be the wildcard. There's, again, a lot of moving parts. The permits could come suddenly a lot faster. And if they do, our customer down there is very anxious to get started, so we could have some faster run-ups. We just -- we're somewhat concerned about our credibility because we've been coming to you and telling you what we were going to do, and did we decide to be a little more conservative and then make sure we hit these numbers? Probably so. Because these things we don't control. So we wanted to come in and be very, very realistic. We spent more time on this forecast than any forecast we've ever spent time on. So there are some unknowns out there that are all -- could turn very positive, but we just can't tell you that they're going to today. They look good. They're there. But we don't know what the schedule is.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's fair in setting a realistic bar, makes a lot of sense. But if you did see revenue accelerate in 2015, is there a reason to think that earnings wouldn't also follow that?","David L. Starling","Oh, Absolutely, it would.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","It would. Okay.","David L. Starling","We are, by no means, changing our story on our long-term growth. I think where we -- what we want to be realistic, we want to be credible. You know we're a company that's very concerned about giving you guidance and then hitting it. And we just wanted to be realistic this year, and there are some variables out there we don't control. We don't think we're going to lose any of these. We think they are definitely coming. It's one reason that we didn't jump out and try to give you some number on Mexican energy reform. We could have thrown some numbers in there and said, \"We think we can do this and this.\" That will also be a surprise for all of us. We definitely know there will be cargo that will be moved, but we don't know what it is yet, so we're not going to tell you. We're not going to give you any numbers.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","When looking at the numbers here for 2014, are we to assume that you don't have anything built in there for the crude stuff that you had talked to us about in couple of past quarters?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","We have crude growth in our plans, Jason. But as I said earlier, as we've gotten into some of the bigger projects, we have seen that they have taken -- they're going to take longer to materialize than we might have expected a year ago. But we do have crude growth, as I mentioned in my comments. Our energy sector is expected to grow, and energy business unit will show growth even though utility coal, with still the majority of our business there, is going to decline in the mid single-digit proportion.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So you still have crude growth, but nothing coming on from the Navy's big projects?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","That's not -- if you looked at the map, the Port Arthur crude terminal is definitely going to take longer than we thought in the past. Again, as I said earlier, I don't think we feel that the size of the prize is necessarily any smaller. It's just going to be a different path to get there. In the meantime, we've actually had 2 or 3 other crude opportunities come up over the course of the last 2 or 3 quarters that we didn't anticipate. But some of these projects will begin to produce and are producing revenues today.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So Port Arthur is out of your projections, but some of the other ones are in?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","No, I didn't say that. I mean, Port Arthur is going to take longer. We still will be -- we expect to deliver crude oil to Port Arthur this year. We will. It's a big project that we're working on. It's going to take longer.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fair enough. And you mentioned -- earlier in the presentation, you talked a little bit about pricing and some of the impacts of RCAF here for 2014. Could you remind us what percent of your business flows into RCAF?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Almost all of our coal business does, and that's really the predominant portion of it. So our coal contracts are all locked in, and they all basically have some RCAF or AILFF [ph] type of adjustments.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question, Dave, I think you highlighted maybe some of what the variances could be for '15 and the reacceleration of revenue growth. I guess I just wanted to think about the '14 outlook when you guys were putting that together. Were there any specific items -- or what were the specific items that maybe could give you variance to the downside or upside? What were the ones that were sort of the toughest ones to call for '14? I guess I just want to get a rough sense as to where the potential question marks may lie this year.","David L. Starling","Well, I think the -- as I stated earlier, the one surprise, and we don't think that it's going to cause a future downside because the market's good is we did think, and when we did our plan last year, that the auto production in Mexico would be coming up much quicker. So that one was a surprise to us. It was a surprise in 2 ways. Number one, they didn't even start the production in January, so it's going to take probably the second or third quarter before they're up to what they would consider to be full production this year. And then they're still half of what they're going to be for next year. So that was one. The crude and the fact that the incidents that we've had out there have created a little more delays in permitting. So some of the crude by rail into a greenfield site is starting to take longer than us or the customer anticipated. If you are going into a site that already is being used to move chemicals or like Tuscaloosa, and all you're doing is increasing your footprint or increasing your growth or building a new track in, that we don't have a problem. But even those are going to be probably not ramping up like we had thought they would until maybe the third quarter. So we've handicapped this, and we took our rose-colored [ph] glasses off and said, \"You know, these guys say they're going to start in February. Let's plug them in the plan for 3 months later.\" Because nobody is exactly hitting exactly what they're telling us they were going to do because of permits. So that is probably been the best I can give you on how we've handicapped the plan this year. If everything goes right, '15 could look totally different.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. That's helpful. And then just switching gears, just to talk very briefly about price. It sounds like the underlying sort of pricing dynamic has not changed for you. There's obviously some inflation adjustment potential for 2014. But when you think about sort of the new business wins and when you just kind of put the entire sort of yield book together for '14, can you just sort of give us a little bit of color on that benefits potentially for mix or headwinds for mix and sort of just what the pricing dynamic on that business looks like right now?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","There's a lot of questions in there, Chris. If you're talking about price or you're talking about revenue per unit, I don't -- mix -- I don't feel like there's a different pricing outlook. Obviously, the coal business is different because of the nature of those contracts and the price adjustments are built into the contracts. So until the contract renews, we obviously just take what the market gives us. But as far as the other businesses, I feel like we've got opportunities to see pricing gains kind of across the portfolio. As we said in the past and as you saw on the slide in the presentation here, Mexican inflation is running a little higher than U.S. So we price kind of based on market conditions and inflation expectations in both markets. So we feel like we might end up with a little bit better pricing view than some of our peers because of the impact of Mexico. I don't know if I'm giving you a satisfying answer, but I think we see -- and new contracts are coming up for renewal. We're seeing good opportunities to take rate increases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Pat or Dave, can you talk a little bit to the competition that you're seeing south of the border and even north of the border? I know in the past, you're saying as these new contracts come on board, you're looking to capture more of the length of haul that's moving in the U.S. Has that just gotten more competitive as well in the last few months? How's that changing?","David L. Starling","I'll start off and let Pat close. No, I mean, we're increasing our length of haul. We're still increasing our Intermodal business. Certainly, there are other service offerings into Mexico. It is a huge market. The El Paso gateway works very well for the West. We've got other gateways that work better for the West. So I think you're going to continue to see new services offered into Mexico other than ours. But we certainly don't have a problem with the position that we're in, the facilities that we have or the service that we offer. And we're -- haven't found ourselves needing to change rates or do anything to be competitive.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I think what's happening is that it's actually somewhat encouraging to hear other people talking about the opportunity the same -- kind of in the same light that we are because, as you know, we've been talking about this cross-border Intermodal truck-to-rail conversion for quite a while. And as Dave said, it's a huge market. It's probably bigger than we could handle on our own long term. So there is -- it's not surprising us that we're seeing other people want to get into that. That's what we're hearing from our asset partners as well. And if you look at the cross-border revenue growth that we've -- we showed this quarter, all of our business units showed increases in cross-border trades. Some of that is growth in cross-border trade between U.S. and Mexico, and some of that has been market share gains.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, and Pat, maybe if I can follow up on that, too. Specific to the Intermodal business, we see the growth rate on your transborder traffic, but can you talk about some of the moving pieces again on that lost contracts business, and how the growth is going to ramp up in that segment this year.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","On that -- how -- can you repeat the end of your question there?","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Well, there's a lot of moving pieces in the Intermodal business right now that are skewing some of those growth rates. I mean, obviously, your transborder business is growing at a very fast pace, but you do have that contract loss that you're lapping. Can you talk about how that growth rate is going to ramp through the year?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","What contract loss are we lapping?","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Or your customer loss, sorry, in the Intermodal business?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Oh, that's L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Right.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","So you got to keep those separate, really, because our cross-border-business is the truck-to-rail conversion. The loss of the contract at L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas was an import shipment from Asia, and we will lap that. So that's why...","David L. Starling","That was not cross border.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","That was not cross border.","David L. Starling","Intra-Mexico.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","That was intra-Mexico, so -- and we are starting to see -- as I mentioned, that still had an impact in the fourth quarter. We won't lap it completely until February, but it really won't have a big impact in the first quarter. So we are seeing, as I mentioned in my comments, L\u00e1zaro, so far -- and realize it's only 22 days, but our L\u00e1zaro business is up pretty nicely so far in January. And we've got new service offerings that have certainly helped that performance. The other thing we've talked about, just before I move on, that -- and it's still under construction on the board for 2015. And again, we don't know how quickly this is going to ramp up or affect the business at L\u00e1zaro, but we have another terminal operator who's in the process of building out a second Intermodal terminal at L\u00e1zaro. And it's all -- we've talked about this several times in the past, APM Terminals. They've announced publicly their plans to spend $900 million developing that site. So we think, long-term, again, that bodes very well for the growth at L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. On the cross-border side, big market. We have a very small share. We are growing rapidly. As Dave mentioned, we expect to add service this year in our cross-border product. We think that, that could actually, possibly accelerate our rate of growth as we move through the year and into 2015 because as our service becomes more truck-like, it will help drive growth because, right now, our service is not as close to truck transit times in some of the markets that we are targeting. But all of our -- we're pursuing a wholesale strategy as far as our cross-border Intermodal is concerned, so we're working with our asset partners. And we continue to see very high level of engagement with them in terms of adding equipment, adding sales resources and really going after this market. So we think we can keep those growth rates up very high. And as I've said, our market share is very low. And there's no reason we can't get to the same level of market share, ultimately, that you're seeing in some of the more mature Intermodal lanes in the U.S.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Susquehanna.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to circle back on 2 specific comments earlier. One on the coal plant, specifically, you indicated you had a derating. I think we saw that in the press. I just want to understand, in terms of staging, since you only do have, what is it, 8 or 9 coal utilities, just give a sense of order magnitude, what does it mean to the total book? And per your comments that, that plant would be shut down in 2015, what -- is there a wind down? Or will we see the full effect of the shutdown in your volumes this year? I just want to get a sense of pacing.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I think, again, we're -- I'm giving you my comments based on what we're hearing from customers. It's always -- it can be wrong. I think you'll see most of it, and again, maybe this is where -- going back to some of the commentary on the guidance, where we've assumed that it's going to be pretty rapid over the course of this year. And it's about -- in total, it's about mid single digits, call it 5% or 6% of our total coal business.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. That's...","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","That's kind of the explanation for the mid single-digit decline that we're seeing in the coal business for 2014.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right, right. And it...","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Possible -- it's -- the agreement that they have struck is by closing that plant down by 2015, we're assuming it's going to happen sooner.","Matthew Troy - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Got it. The follow-up question would be just your comments on the lower paper shipments. I know you said that there was a plant shutdown, but I was just interested more in your second comment about there was some sense that there was some slippage in core demand. And now paper's obviously a difficult business given digitization and substitution of media, but I was wondering if you were making a broader statement because paper, traditionally, has been viewed as a harbinger for the economy about that particular customer? Or did you see the paper business across your franchise as being somewhat more moderate than we would expect it? Just a little color, please.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","That's actually a good question, and it was more isolated to one large customer. We didn't see it kind of across the board, and it sort of depends on the product. But we also know that, as I mentioned, production levels were very high going into the end of the year. I would say higher than normal, so we're still kind of trying to sort out if this is an inventory issue that will work itself out over a few weeks, or whether there is some softening in demand, at least for some of these products. So what we've heard from the customer is that they don't see a downturn. What we've seen in our volumes is that they've been lower. So we're kind of trying to make sense out of it. And it's a little too soon to know for sure how that's going to play out, but we're keeping an a eye on it.","David L. Starling","But we're not looking at it right now as an indication that the economy's going down. I mean, we're looking at it more from our customers\u2019 view that they are down.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And if we think about the products and some of the markets that they serve, we're not seeing declines in those areas. But -- so it's one that we'll kind of stay tuned on, but, certainly, one that stands out.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","On the -- I thought the -- on the rollout that the 2 auto plants were coming on in -- at the end of '13 and a couple were -- 2 more coming in, in early '14. Just want to understand, when did you get the revised ramp-up schedules? And to Dave, your point on the -- 2015, are they now talking about full production by 2015? Or is that level the doubling to full initial production levels?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","This has been an evolving process, Ken, as they have gotten closer to production and, really, kind of understood, I guess, it's one thing to say that they're going to start producing autos. But then, in one case, what we learned, as we get into the details, is it's very small production runs that really aren't going to impact our volumes to as great an extent for some period of time. So if you look at the 3 plants that have opened, one has actually opened in December, but again, producing at very small levels. The others were not -- the other 2 were originally expected to open in the first quarter, which they will. And by open, I mean, they will be producing vehicles. But as it turns out, the rate of production of those vehicles is going to be very small. They're going to -- in one case, it's a new product where they're literally going to produce a handful of vehicles for their dealers throughout North America. And then the real production ramp-up will occur kind of over the second quarter and into the back half of the year. And then, again, I'm speaking about one plant, just to give you an example, but their production is expected to double in 2015.","Michael W. Upchurch","Ken, this is Mike. You asked questions specifically when. And as you can imagine, this is a fairly fluid situation where you continually get updates from customers. But the total production of those new facilities is still slightly above 600,000. During the fourth quarter, we were out at a couple of conferences indicating this was going to be a little bit slower, and that we expected about half of that to be produced in 2014.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","[indiscernible] You go ahead.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Ken raises a good point that I'll go back to comments that Dave and I made earlier, is that the size of the price here is still the same. These plants will produce. The 3 of them that have opened will produce over 600,000 vehicles. It's just going to be a different trajectory to get there.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I get that. But I guess if you're talking about 3 different auto plants and that size of a difference, and as they got that close to production -- I mean, were they giving you that large of a difference in terms of number, even up until the end of, I guess, mid October in terms of their ramp schedule that had changed -- I imagine just in terms of discussions in terms of prepping equipment, locomotives and crews and everything on your side to change the production level in this quick of a timeframe just seems all 3 -- 3 different companies that are producing autos, just seems a sizable extreme to have that impact to their entire supply chain right as you launch those plants. It just seems a large impact from 3 different companies or 3 different customers to throw all at the same time.","Michael W. Upchurch","Well, Ken, I don't think it's really that significantly different. I think the production capacity has always been slightly above 600,000. And like I said, as they got closer to opening those plants, we got revised forecasts. And as I indicated, out at several conferences, indicated that we expected about half of that total production capacity to be produced in 2014 with the remainder of the ramp going into 2015.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm sorry. I must have missed that. So you were already indicating ahead of this that, that production will be half that level?","Michael W. Upchurch","About 300,000, right.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the -- let me just jump over to crude. I guess, same thing in terms of the development, I guess. But this is more market based, I'm guessing, in the switch from Bakken moving east. And, I guess, can you describe -- is that a -- is that just a spread issue that's driving the Bakken east and the time on Canadian crude coming down? I guess, when do you expect that transition to move down south? And what kind of timeframe?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","We're moving crude -- and our Canadian crude actually grew quite a bit, even though it's a smaller base than the Bakken and West Texas. And I think you're exactly right. What we saw, sort of a double whammy, if you will, is the West Texas and Bakken -- and I think you've seen this in one of our peers, is really because of the pricing, the spreads, it was sort of diverted away from the Gulf Coast. So we were moving Bakken. We did not necessarily expect that it would move away from the Gulf Coast as quickly as it did. And on the Canadian crude, we are ramping up, and we will see heating equipment and storage equipment being added to the terminals that we serve this year. So we are forecasting and expecting pretty good growth in our crude oil year-over-year. But some of the bigger projects, like the one that we've been talking about at Port Arthur, are going to take longer than we expected largely because of some of the permitting issues that Dave mentioned. And so, again, I don't -- we don't feel differently about the ultimate size of the opportunity. It's just going to take a little longer to get there.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Pat, can you give the -- did you give the mix of what is West Texas versus -- or Bakken and West Texas versus Canadian crude in your, maybe, this quarter and last quarter?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","If you look at this quarter, it was almost all Canadian, very little Bakken and West Texas. And last quarter, I mean, it would have been predominantly Bakken and West Texas. So we saw a pretty rapid flip in terms of the origin that we are handling.","Michael W. Upchurch","Ken, this is Mike again. All the way back into September, we were providing some details on the 3 different origins and what was happening to Bakken and West Texas, which was clearly declining, partly because of the spread issue, and that Canadian crude was still rather strong. So that mix shift began taking place late summer, and we were indicating that in the September timeframe.","David L. Starling","And I think we would have actually seen that start to hit the Eastern rails, too, as they're crude by rail went up.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Larkin of Stifel.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","With the shift towards more of a long-term focus on heavy crude coming out of Canada and with the possibility of the northern half of the Keystone pipeline being approved in light of all the crude by rail incidents, often there's a knee-jerk reaction to that sort of thing. Does that give you any heartburn in terms of investing to position yourself to handle more heavy crude out of Canada going forward? Can the Keystone handle all that will be coming to the Gulf? Or is that just a small fraction of the total?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","John, yes, we think the Keystone can handle about 50% of the volume that -- the import volume that the Port Arthur requires. And for some of the same reasons that we've talked about and others have talked about in the past, even if the pipeline capacity gets built, we believe that there are -- there is a role for crude by rail in terms of capital investment, lower capital investment, flexibility, you know the reasons. So we're still seeing and hearing that those factors will prevail in making the crude by rail sustainable. As far as the investment, a lot of the investment has taken place, and our service region is not on us. The shippers typically own the cars. So our investment's going to be track capacity to handle the trains, which we will make as the business occurs in locomotives, so -- and the arrangement that we've been talking about at Port Arthur in terms of the large crude terminal. Again, we're working with a partner, and the capital investment for the facility will largely be theirs.","David L. Starling","And if I could add to that, too. The rail's secret sauce is the fact that we can take the condensate and move that back to the origin. That's a real problem with a pipeline. So our crude-by-rail customers -- and some of these customers are pipeline customers, tell us that our secret sauce is not only are we a mobile pipeline, but they will make arrangements to take that condensate and move it back up to Canada. So that is -- we're being told a big advantage.","John G. Larkin - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then maybe just as a follow-on on the Intermodal side. Clearly, your cross-border business is growing at a very rapid clip off a small base. But given the compelling economics and how much easier it is to sort of clear customs, et cetera, going by rail, you would've thought maybe that transition from highway to rail would've even been faster. Are there any capacity utilization issues on your system? Or are there service improvements that need to be made to really convince the truckers that Intermodal is a very capable substitute for the over-the-road alternative?","David L. Starling","Well, density gives you more direct trains. I've spoke about this in the past. When you don't have solid trains out of origins, then you end up doing kind of a milk run and picking up 3 different terminals in Mexico rather than coming out of one. So we're getting to those points where we're starting to build the density. And then when we do that, we create the train start. That's how I answered the question earlier about the cost side of it. There will be a little bit of a chicken and an egg where we have to create a new train start with more of a -- 2 origin, 2 destination, rather than 4 or 5 origins and multiple destinations. So we make a lot of blocks right now to service a lot of markets. So that will start to get cleaned up as we get more business. So it's really a density issue, and that will improve the service. So yes, you get to levels where you're more truck-like and you get more business, then it helps you get to the next level to get even faster than truck. But we do have that advantage at the border crossing. But we're continuing to grow. And the partners that we're growing with have not lost their conviction. And there's a lot of issues coming up on the truck side this year, next year. They've got their own regulatory issues. They've still got HOSS [ph] to deal with. They've got CAS [ph] to deal with. They're going to have to pay their drivers more. So they still see -- the truckers do that Intermodal is going to be one of their major tools for a long time.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","On the cost side of the equation, you've talked about the lease-to-own strategy for locomotives. But I was curious if you could provide some other areas from a productivity or a cost-initiative standpoint where you feel like you can drive additional margin expansion going forward.","David R. Ebbrecht","Sure, this is Dave Ebbrecht. We have multiple areas where we continue to look at how we can drive costs down. The first thing that we wanted to invest in is our yards and look at our critical production yards as we grow and invest just ahead of the growth and grow smartly in our yards building out, our receiving yards and our capability to receive and handle trains. The next is we want to look at our secure corridor and the efficiencies at the international bridge and to continue to build the capacity for the future to handle all the increased growth that will be coming out of Mexico. Then we're doing a lot of things around the infusion of technology within our rail operations, everything from the use of inward-facing cameras that we believe is just going to have great value to how we operate and really mitigate a lot of our failure cost, to asset help and wayside indicators that will help to prevent any type of catastrophic failures on the rail side. We also are doing things like installing CTC, centralized traffic control, on Laredo sub. It's going to greatly improve the fluidity between Laredo up to the Robstown area. And there's all sorts of things that we're looking at as far as automated clearance systems in Mexico to look in camera technology at the border for security purposes and going to one crew, handling in between our yard in Mexico, all the way into the U.S. But we really have a lot of good efforts that's going to streamline our efficiency. And the key tagline is that we're going to grow smartly and just ahead of our growth.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. That's helpful detail. I appreciate it. Quick follow-up. I know it's been a long call, but I did want to ask about CapEx. It was helpful to get the detail for 2014. But as you look beyond this year, do you think CapEx, as a percent of total revenues, stays around this 20% level the next few years? Or is there a chance we could see some moderation?","David L. Starling","Well, I think what you saw in Dave's presentation was that our mainline CapEx, we've got the system robust and up now. We're very confident of the quality that, that number will start to drop. So the main group of CapEx that will run that 10% -- 10% to 11%, should start to come down maybe 1% a year. So it'll be the other part of the capacity growth that we will be making decisions on where we need to grow. There's lanes today that we can grow in that don't require any capacity expansion. There are some lanes that would require capital. So a lot of it is going to depend just where the growth is coming. But yes, I don't see us back up in the 26s, and I do see us over time starting to come back down into the range of the rest of the industry.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My question is on the resource side. As your expectations and your customer expectations about volumes have shifted, is there anything you're doing specific on the network resource side? Are you carrying more than you normally would, recognizing volume is around the corner? Or how should we think about resources?","David R. Ebbrecht","Yes, this is Dave Ebbrecht again. I'll address the fact that as we grow and we have the resources in place just ahead of the growth, what we do is stairstep the growth into it so that we'll run extra train starts and materialize the gross in a phased-in period. There is nothing that we have on a resource right now that will be considered extra resources or anything that we won't be utilizing or optimizing utilization of going into 2014. But what we will create is latent capacity that we can continue to grow on until we hit different stairstep function. So I'm comfortable that resources are appropriately sized for all the business growth opportunities that we're seeing on the horizon. And as new opportunities present themselves, we'll do what takes to make sure the appropriate resources are in place.","David L. Starling","Let me add to this just a little different statement. We did not back down off of what we were putting in the capital budget when we got a little more conservative. We know that this volume is coming, so we are preparing for it. The fact that it's going to take us a little bit longer than we first anticipated, we did not step back and say, \"Okay, let's pull back on capacity.\" We are building the network out to handle the volume that we have predicted would be coming for several years. So there is no lack of conviction on our side on what we need to do to handle the growth that's coming.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, so this idea of creating latent capacity, all else being equal then, '15 should see resources grow at a pace slower than volume, all else being equal? Does that sound right?","David L. Starling","Not necessarily. That'll all depends on where it's going to grow, as I said earlier, in what corridor. If we're going deeper into Mexico -- if it's a move that goes from Kansas City to L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, you've got a very long network to look at to see what you need to add. If it's going from Kansas City to Baton Rouge, I don't have to do a lot on capacity. I've got capacity. So kind of a tough question to answer unless you know exactly where the growth is on that traffic so...","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","But in theory, the longer length of haul would also create better RPU, and it comes out in the wash that way.","David L. Starling","Certainly. Absolutely.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","It's been a long call. I just have one question for you, Dave. So the stock's obviously down a lot today, and CapEx is coming in a little bit, and you guys are still expecting pretty nice earnings growth. Do you anticipate going to the board anytime soon and asking for a buyback authorization?","David L. Starling","First of all, we didn't anticipate the stock going down today. So no, the answer to that is no. We are still a growth company. We would have a lot of dividend work to do before we started going in and asking for a stock buyback. You'd see dividend improvement first.","Operator","At this time, we have reached the end of our allotted time for questions and have time for one final question today coming from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you just provide us a little bit more details on your FX hedging strategy and the percent you've covered for 2014 and '15?","Michael W. Upchurch","Sure, Tom. That can be a fairly lengthy explanation, but I think we did a pretty solid job hedging that risk this year and have taken a very similar approach to hedging that risk for next year. In fact, we've executed pretty much all of the forward contracts that need to be in place. So our expectation sitting here today would -- you would see the same dynamic at the end of 2014 where we've properly hedged that risk, particularly that income tax risk of the changing peso. So basically, same strategy we executed, and we do have a slide in the Appendix that shows you how that hedge functioned during the course of 2013.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-on, are you protected from swings of 10% or more?","Michael W. Upchurch","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Starling, I'd like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","David L. Starling","Okay. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call. Great questions, and we will see you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"12345":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q2 2014 Earnings Conference Call July 18, 2014  8:45 AM ET","Executives","","Dave Starling - President and CEO","Pat Ottensmeyer - EVP of Sales and Marketing","Mike Upchurch - EVP and CFO","Jose Zozaya - Executive Representative and President, KCSM","Analysts","","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs ","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Justin Long - Stephens","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the Kansas City Southern Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in the listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the Company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed with the SEC.

All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS Web site, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Dave Starling, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may now begin.","Dave Starling","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Kansas City Southern's second quarter financial results. Joining me this morning are Pat Ottensmeyer, EVP of Sales and Marketing; Mike Upchurch, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. And Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, KCSM\u2019s President and Executive Representative is joining by telephone and will be available for questions later-on on the call.","I will handle the operations segment this morning and by now I am sure everyone is aware that the changes have been lead in KCS\u2019 operations department. And for the time being the section has under operations report directly to me. While all the Class 1 railroads had faced challenges this year, KCS\u2019 operating metrics have remained strong, actually among the best in the industry. We have excellent people in place at levels throughout our operations department and they continue to perform at a very high level.","Most of you know that my rail background and first and foremost in operations. To this day I enjoy being out on the railroad and joining the morning operating conference call. While I don\u2019t see this as a career change for me, you should understand that we will take our time to ensure we get the organization and the personnel right. We were looking ahead to a new tranche of business opportunities at KCS over the next five to 10 years in its imparity that the transportation organization is working in collaboration with finance and marketing to ensure optimal service to our customers and profitability for our Company. Teamwork and respecting your counterparts is not negotiable.","Okay, let\u2019s turn now to a second quarter overview. KCS reported a 12% year-over-year increase in revenues. It has been the case for the last few quarters the revenue gain was primarily driven by grain, which was up 58% in the second quarter. Revenues from our five strategic growth areas were up 18% and accelerated significantly from the first quarter. Pat will provide more color about some of these areas in a few minutes. ","Our solid business growth was complemented by equally strong operations. Together the two were the primary catalyst (taking) [ph] as recording a 67% adjusted operating ratio, a whole 2 point improvement from a year ago. Finally, the second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of a $1.21 was 26% higher than last year. ","Briefly turning to how we have performed year-to-date relative to our January guidance. You see that we are right on target on our mid-single digit volume forecast, having grown 5% through the first six months. Revenue growth of 11% was a bit higher than our high single-digit projections. However, when you exclude the outsized year-over-year impact of grain, our increase was 7%. I feel we have been consistent in our message that first grain revenues would show strong year-over-year growth of the second half of 2013 through the first half of 2014. And second, the grain comparables will get very hard in the second half of 2014 through the first half of 2015.","The severe drought of 2012 has had an abnormal impact on grain comparables and we're moving back to more traditional measured growth in grain. So far year-to-date KCS has improved its adjusted operating ratio by 1.9 points. We expect to hit our target for 2014 of a 1 point to a 1.5 improvement or even a little better. ","Finally, KCS adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 22% year-to-date, outpacing our mid-teens projection for the year. While we're pleased with our first half EPS performance, we are not prepared to change our guidance for the full year. There is a few reasons for this.","I have already discussed the grain comparables get harder in the second half. In addition, we just don\u2019t have clear enough visibility on our coal business in the months ahead. You'll remember that one of our utility customers closed down a number of generating units after September last year. We don\u2019t know if that will happen again and we don\u2019t know if some of our utility customers will seek to expand their whole stockpiles as a hedge against rail service issues with originating carriers that have impacted cycle times in 2014. In short, while we expect the second half to be good for us, there are a few variables which will impact our growth rate and that leads us to remain cautious.","The next chart illustrates that KCS continues to achieve excellent productivity as measured by carloads per employee. KCS remains an industry leader in this area (whilst) [ph] it\u2019s maintaining its good, efficient operations. It\u2019s no secret that the rail industry as a whole is battling through a number of capacity challenges which will take some time to resolve. Nevertheless, in the face of these challenges, KCS continues to provide solid operating performance and as the industry works through its issues, we expect KCS operations to improve further and then be an industry leader in areas highlighted on this slide.","With that I will turn it over to Pat.","Pat Ottensmeyer","","Thanks, Dave. Good morning everyone. I'll begin my comments on slide 10. As you heard earlier, revenue for the second quarter was 649.7 million on volumes of 573.6000 units, both are new quarterly records for KCS. Revenue per unit increased by 5%, due primarily to increased length of haul as our cross-border revenue increased by 24% versus last year. Major factor in the RPU growth was the strength in cross-border grain. Foreign exchange was a slight negative during the quarter, reducing revenues primarily in our automotive business unit by about $5 million or about 80 basis points.","Moving to the major business units, as you can see on this slide, except for energy, we have very strong growth across our entire portfolio. Chemical and petroleum revenues increased by 6% on volume growth of 3% versus last year. All major commodity groups have growth in this group with particular strength in petroleum shipments in Mexico and agricultural chemicals in the U.S. Our Industrial and Consumer business recorded revenue growth of 10% on a 7% increase in carloads. The headline here was our metals business which represented about 85% of the revenue growth in this business unit.","Revenue in our metals and scrap business grew by 21% on a 17% increase in volume. In the past, you have heard us talk about the growing number of steel plants in Mexico and the strength in Mexico auto manufacturing and our performance this quarter is a consequence of those factors. Our housing and construction related business were also very strong during the quarter with revenues in our lumber and plywood commodity group increasing by 35% compared to last year. Our Pulp and Paper business was a bit weak with both volumes and revenues lower by less than 1% from last year. We did see some extended downtime as some of the paper plants we serve which we expect to improve over the remainder of 2014.","As was the case in the first quarter, our Ag and minerals group were the star performers this quarter with revenue increasing by 33% on volume growth of 21% from last year. ","Revenue per unit was up 10% due largely to an increase on our cross border shipments [Technical Difficulty] higher than last year. The payments and earlier revenue in our grain business increased by 58% from last year and I can also tell you that our cross border grain revenues increased by 89% from 2013.","The story here is very similar to what you heard last quarter and that would be easy comps. Due to the drought of last year you all know the story about the first half, first eight months of 2013 and this will begin to change as Dave mentioned in the third quarter. Although as you\u2019ll see in a minute we are increasing our full year outlook for Ag and Min based largely on year-to-date performance rather than a significant change in the outlook for the second half of the year. As I mentioned earlier our energy business unit was the only area where we saw weakness from the prior year and that weakness was in both utility, coal and crude oil, where revenues fell by 7% and 37% respectively from last year.","No doubt that our utility coal business could have performed better this quarter, were it not for congestion and service problems experienced throughout the North American rail network. We\u2019re not going to attempt to quantify the impact here but the good news is this, we do believe that there could be some additional volume and revenue coming in the months ahead above normal seasonal trends as utilities build stock piles from their current low levels. Service improvements will be the key to realizing that opportunity.","The crude oil story this quarter is very similar to what I reported at the end of the first quarter, we experienced a dramatic shift away from light, crude moving through the Gulf Coast due to new pipeline capacity coming on-board. In April I reported that the impact of this would be most pronounced in the first quarter and second quarter and that we will see some improvements in the comps in the second half of the year as new terminals for heavy Canadian crew become available and operational. That is still our view.","Frac sand business continued to show strong growth trends with revenues and volumes increasing by 21% and 27% respectively. Intermodal revenue grew by 14% on volume growth of 7% versus last year. Cross-border revenue in our intermodal business grew by 30% from last year. Our domestic U.S. intermodal business was also quite stronger and shorter with revenues and volumes growing by 29% and 18% respectively. This is primarily our Dallas business to and from the Southeast and mid-Atlantic region. Revenue growth related to our L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas intermodal business was 6.4% higher compared to last year. ","Finally revenues in our automotive business unit increased by 25% on volume growth of 23% versus last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on revenues of about 5%. Revenue and volume growth this quarter were both positively impacted by favorable comp from last year due to an extended outage of plant we serve in Mexico.","We estimate the impact of this to be about $3.7 million, in other words had that outage not occurred, revenues last year would have been about $3.7 million higher than what we reported. We are clearly beginning to see the benefit of the new auto plants in Mexico including the growth in cross-border revenue in this group. Cross-border revenues here were up 71% from last year.","Moving on to slide 11, as I mentioned earlier our cross-border revenue increased by 24% from last year to a new record level of $163.2 million. We saw a growth in all major business units except for industrial and consumer which was down slightly due to a decline in cross-border paper shipments. The major growth drivers here were Ag and Min which was up 54% including cross-border grain which I mentioned earlier was up 89% from last year. Intermodal was up 30% and automotive while smaller than the others grew by 71%.","Moving to Slide 12, you can see the profile of the five strategic growth areas that we\u2019ve highlighted in the past. Collectively they grew by 18% during the quarter, in spite of the 37% decline in crude oil from last year. I will point out the crude oil currently represents less than 5% of the total revenue from these five commodity groups and less than 1% of total (KPS) [ph] revenue. The reasons I mentioned a moment ago we feel as the negative comps for crude oil will begin to improve in the months ahead. The key point from this slide is that our main growth markets continue to produce oversized growth and the outlook for each is very positive. At some point in the future we will add Mexico energy markets and Gulf Coast ethylene opportunities to this slide. And I\u2019ll show you more about that in a few minutes.","Moving to Slide 13, we\u2019ve updated our outlook for freight revenue for the full year of 2014. As you can see the only change we have made from what we discussed with you in April is an increase in the outlook for Ag and Minerals from single-digit revenue growth to our current view which is for double-digit revenue growth for the full year. As I mentioned earlier this is driven primarily by strength in the actual year-to-date results which were better than our previous outlook and some improvement in the third quarter outlook.","The year-over-year comps begin to get much more difficult in August, September timeframe as the third quarter and fourth quarter of last year were very strong for our grain business. The only other business units that I will explain here is energy where we\u2019ve seen year-to-date revenue about 1% below last year but we are still expecting single digit revenue growth for the full year. ","We are expecting utility coal comps to be flat in 2013 in the second half of the year which would be an improvement to what we\u2019ve seen so far. As I mentioned earlier, we could see some potential upside based on rebuilding stock piles from current low levels but that will be dependent upon improvements in the cycle times we are currently experiencing. ","Finally, our crude oil comps will improve in the second half of the year for reasons I\u2019ve already covered. ","And now just talk about the other business units, there really is no change from our previous commentary and our full year projections and expectations shown here are very consistent with the year-to-date results in each of those.","Now moving onto more fun stuff, on slide 14, very pleased to talk more openly about our plans for the Port Arthur crude terminal and specifically to inform you that we have finalized negotiations and executed agreements with Global Partners LP to develop a 200 acre site on which they will build a rail terminal to handle heavy Canadian crude oil. I am sure most of you saw our joint press release with Global from July 8th, if not, it\u2019s still on our website so you can take a look at that.","Slides 14 and 15 provide a high level summary of our agreement, a little bit about Global, which is a publicly traded master limited partnership and a current drawing of the planned rail terminal. I am sure you\u2019ll have a lot of questions which in the interest of full disclosure now we will probably not answer to your complete satisfaction. We are not in a position to share revenue or volume projections with you at this time. Here is what we\u2019re prepared to say. We feel the Global is an excellent choice as a partner on this project since they have developed a successful business model in the East and on the West Coast, which they intent to replicate here in Port Arthur. They\u2019ve told us that this project is part of their three-coated strategy and they share our excitement about the potential for Port Arthur and the U.S. Gulf Coast markets.","Global\u2019s initial focus will be to deliver heavy Canadian crude oil to Port Arthur and the U.S. Gulf. We\u2019ve talked with you previously about the size of that market and the potential for crude by rail which we continue to believe is substantial. At this point, we do not know the specific origins or gateways that we will be using but believe it will be a combination of both Canadian Pacific and Canadian National origins and over the multiple KCS gateways.","As you can see on slide 15, the initial terminal design will be capable of handling two 120 car unit trains per day and 340,000 barrels of storage capacity with water front access to serve the local refineries by barge. Given permitting and construction uncertainties associated with a Greenfield site such as this one, we are currently expecting a completion date of late 2016 or early 2017. I can assure that Global will be very happy to open sooner than that if all goes well through the process. Between now and then however Global will be aggressively pursuing business opportunities in this market and will be using other KCS terminals and facilities in the area to handle that business.","That's really about all the detail we are prepared to provide at this point, we just like to reiterate that we are very excited about this long term opportunity and pleased to have commenced our partnership with Global on this project.","Moving to slide 16, we have more fun stuff to share with you. Since our first quarter earnings call, there have been public announcements of two additional new auto plants to be built in Mexico over the coming years. Of course you are all familiar with the Nissan, Mazda and Honda plants that have been opened in the last few months as well as the Audi plants that is currently under construction in Puebla. In the last 90 days, both Nissan and Infiniti in a coproduction arrangement with Mercedes Benz and BMW have publicly announced plans to build new plants in Mexico.","The Infiniti and Mercedes plant will be located in Aguascalientes where the other Nissan plants are located, the new BMW plant will be located in San Luis Potosi on the KCSM network and very close to our (inter port) [ph] intermodal facility. As you can see on this slide at full announced production levels these two new plants will add about 450,000 new vehicles to the current Mexican production capacity. When we include the 173,000 vehicles at the new Audi plant which will open in 2016, these three facilities will represent an increase of about 15% in Mexican auto capacity.","At this time it\u2019s too soon to know how these facilities will impact our volumes and revenues and routings, however based on preliminary discussion with these producers we believe the impact of these new plants will be to extend the time period for superior automotive growth for KCS. I\u2019ll talk about that in a second. Even better news is that we believe there will be likely be more new auto plants announced in Mexico possibly even in the near future.","Moving to slide 17, we introduced this slide in our earnings presentation for the first time last quarter. Just to remind you what we are trying to illustrate here is the time period during which we are expecting superior growth for each of our key long term strategic growth areas. Since this slide focuses on longer term growth opportunities some of which are not yet producing revenue or volume, we have added Mexico energy markets and Gulf Coast ethylene plants. ","Based on the two new automotive plants announced in Mexico, as I just mentioned, you can see that we have extended the period of expected superior growth for automotive beyond 2018. Just a couple of other comments, you can see that we expect superior growth in crude oil beginning in 2015 even though we do not expect the global Port Arthur facility to be completed until 2016 or 2017. The reason for this is that we will have other new facilities in the Port Arthur, Beaumont and Baton Rouge markets opening in late 2014 or early 2015 that we expect to drive this growth.","Finally, I'll wrap up with slide 18, since I've covered most of these points already, I'll just make a few closing comments. We see no significant change in the economic outlook in either the U.S. or Mexico for the rest of the year. The GDP forecast you see here are down a bit from what we showed in the first quarter and based on most recent estimates for the U.S., they are down even a little bit below what we show on this slide. But we certainly still see evidence of economic growth for the rest of the year. I have already talked a lot about grain and Mike Upchurch will get into more detail about the impact of the second half grain comps on our guidance for the full year revenue which is as Dave Starling covered earlier, our outlook for full year revenue growth remains in the high single-digits area. While our official outlook for coal is to be flat for the second half as I mentioned earlier, there could be some upside if the cycle times improve and utilities are able to build inventories. ","One thing I haven\u2019t mention yet is pricing. We still believe that the pricing environment is positive and we continue to expect the price increases will be above inflation. If we look at all of the contracts or rate quotes, that we renewed during the second quarter, our weighted average rate increase was 3.6% that\u2019s different than same-store sales and that is an indication of what we can expect to see in the future based on rate adjustments that were agreed to during this last quarter.","I'll close by saying that our new business pipeline continues to be strong and growing and we still believe and feel very good about our long-term growth prospects. And with that I'll turn the presentation over to Mike.","Mike Upchurch ","","Thanks, Pat. Starting on slide 20, our second quarter volumes grew 7% and revenues 12%. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange revenues actually would have been up 13%. Our adjusted operating ratio improved twofold points to 67 and good expense management led to incremental margins in the quarter of 44%. Our adjusted EPS grew 26% during the quarter, representing strong adjusted operating income of 20% and lower adjusted effective tax rate resulting primarily from discrete items in the second quarter of 2013. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 33% and we now expect full year effective tax rate to be approximately 34%.","And it might give you just a little color behind the lower tax rate in the second quarter. We did benefit from a one-time discrete item which lowered our effective tax rate by about 1% in the quarter but for the full year that gets blended and we still expect to be around 34% for the year. ","For additional details on our condensed quarterly income statement, please refer to that information back in the appendix. On slide 21, we just wanted to help reconcile our reported to adjusted EPS. As you can see in the second quarter, we did have a $0.05 charge related to lease termination cost which resulted from the purchase of $171 million of equipment under lease. ","This program continues to allow us to generate improving income statement result not only in operating income but net income. In the second quarter of 2013, we incurred sizable debt retirement cost of a 111 million that negatively impacted EPS by $0.70. These costs were incurred in connection with our refinancings after we achieved our investment grade credit ratings. And during the second quarter of 2014, we did generate a $0.04 gain primarily from currency hedges which more than offset a slightly negative impact to income taxes from the currency revaluation of our U.S. dollar debt Mexico. And then in comparison, we incurred a net $0.12 charge in the second quarter of 2013 related to items.","On slide 22, our adjusted operating expenses excluding the lease termination cost of 8 million, increased 9%. I will cover more specific details on our expense changes in the following slides but volume based drivers were clearly the largest contributor causing about 60% of our expense increase or $22 million for items such as crew labor, fuel consumption, repairs and certain purchase services such as trackage rights, lift charges, switching and joint facilities charges. ","Lastly I might point out that foreign exchange benefited expenses by 5 million and had no material impact on operating income given the negative we saw from foreign currency on revenues. ","On Slide 23, our compensation expenses increased 6 million due to higher operating headcount to support increased volumes and wage inflation of 4 million, while FX reduced expenses by 2 million.","And as you can see in the bar chart our quarterly average employee headcount increased 2.3% which is still far below the 7% volume growth we experienced in the quarter evidenced that we continue to efficiently manage our labor costs.","On Slide 24, purchased services increased 13 million, largely from volume based expenses, again things such as joint facilities, switching car maintenance, trackage rights and intermodal left which contributed about 6 million to the increase. We did have higher track repairs and maintenance of three and legal and consulting fees were up year-over-year by 2 million.","Turning to fuel on Slide 25, we saw fuel expenses increased 15 million or 16% and that was largely driven by increased volumes and GTMs. GTMs in the quarter increased 12% from a year ago and is reflective of increased long haul grain shipments. Price also contributed to a $5 million increase in fuel price as we saw the price per gallon increase $0.08 year-over-year and that was largely the result of increase in fuel prices in Mexico. And then FX and efficiency gains reduced our fuel expense by a total of 3 million. ","We did have a slight negative lag impact of 900,000 in the quarter again largely because of increasing fuel prices in Mexico.","Slide 26, we introduced this format in the last quarterly call our equipment cost continued to decline as we purchased more equipment under existing lease and replace the expiring leases with purchased equipment. Specifically we saw equipment cost decline 9 million year-over-year while depreciation increased 4 million creating a net $5 million benefit in operating income.","On Slide 27, I wanted to share a few details about our planned use of cash that we\u2019re generating from our operations. First and foremost we will continue to invest in our business to support these growth opportunities that Pat discussed earlier. And as we guided to on the first quarter call, we continue to estimate we will spend approximately 28% of our revenue on capital this year.","Second, our next priority will be to provide shareholder returns via dividends. As you know earlier this year our Board of Directors approved a 30% increase of our dividend. ","And then lastly we will continue to be selective in terms of purchasing leased equipment that is both earnings accretive and generates positive NPVs. During the quarter we purchased an additional 171 million of locomotives and equipment and now have increased our ownership percentage from roughly 20% a couple of years ago to 50% and in total have purchased in excess of $600 million of leased equipment.","On Slide 28 and 29, I wanted to provide a little bit more detail on our guidance. As you can see in the bar charts we have reported strong revenue growth of 10% and 12% in the first and second quarters respectively. However as illustrated in the black portion of the bars we have seen a significant boost to our revenue growth rates as of the result of easy grain comparisons which added 5% and 4% respectively to the first two quarters of the year.","Currently despite strong crop conditions we expect grain revenues to be flat in the back half for the year, thus eliminating a sizeable portion of our first half of the year 2014 growth rates. Additionally due to continued uncertainty about a significant coal customer shipments in the back half of the year and natural gas prices now hovering around the $4 range, we believe our coal revenues could also be flat over 2013 levels. Accordingly we are confirming our high single-digit revenue guidance we issued back in January and we\u2019ll continue to keep you posted as our coal and grain situation becomes more clear.","Finally on Slide 29, given the commentary about our grain and coal revenue projections, we currently believe third quarter EPS will be up low double-digits compared to the 22% year-to-date increase that we\u2019ve seen so far. And just for clarity we do define low double-digits as the range of 10% to 13% and believe that we\u2019ll be at the upper end of that range for the third quarter. ","For now we believe we can achieve the upper end of our mid-teens full year EPS guidance but if grain and coal shipments do accelerate over our current forecast and July is off to a reasonably good start, it is possible we can deliver upper teens EPS growth for the year.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave.","Dave Starling","","Okay, thank you Mike. I\u2019ll open it up for questions. I would caution everyone we\u2019d like to keep it to one question and one follow up. We have a lot of people in the queue this morning. So out of respect of getting everyone\u2019s question answered, please keep to the one question and one follow up. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now be conducting a question-and-answer-session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter, Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Mike, Pat and Dave, thanks for the great insights here. But if we look at -- I just want to understand maybe your outlook here a little bit more on the grain side. Are you looking for volumes to turn negative or hold levels as we move into the back half? And then maybe a little bit longer term maybe if you can give insight on the volatility and we should expect as we move into 2015 and beyond for the two markets?","Dave Starling","Ken, I\u2019ll start, and then turn it over to Pat. Last year we had a great harvest, great grain movements, we didn\u2019t have as many of the congestion problems. Not all of the grain that comes to KCS originates on our system. So we are still dependent on origins that are off our line. So one bit of caution we have is some of the service related issues that could somewhat smooth out the harvest. As far as the harvest itself it looks like it\u2019s going to be a record grain crop. Also what happens when you still have the service issues it does affect the car supply so there is nothing wrong with the harvest, there is nothing wrong with the potential movement of grain, we\u2019re just unsure of what the philosophy is going to off our system and the car supply. Pat?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yes, I don\u2019t have a lot to add. I guess fairly consistent with what we said in the past we\u2019re -- the comps are getting harder the second half is going to look a lot different than the first half. The third quarter should still be up because when we really didn\u2019t see the strength last year until the backend of the third quarter but we think the fourth quarter could actually be down. Longer term grain has been kind of a slow growth market and when you introduce things like floods and draughts you get a lot of volatility. But over the long term it should be a slow growth market for us.","Dave Starling","And Ken to throw in a little more color I think one reason we\u2019re having a strong quarter in grain now is because the grain has somewhat been smoothed out by the availability of cars and service. So we\u2019re having a stronger quarter than we normally would simply because there is still grain in the elevators to be moved from last year\u2019s harvest.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","And that was actually the reason for the question, because it looked like third quarter should still see some nice -- at least uptick relative to the slower third quarter start last year. But then Pat, I appreciate that on the fourth quarter. ","And then my follow up just on lease conversions, Mike you mentioned what you spent so far you\u2019re now up to 50%. Is there a target or a timing for additional conversions?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, I think as we indicated a few years ago when we started this effort it would likely take us five to eight years to really execute that strategy. We\u2019re roughly three years into it. I think as we look out over the next two to three years, we\u2019ll probably be able to complete that and move that low 50% range to maybe somewhere in the mid-60s, which would be a target. And that\u2019s about what the ownership has progressed through the industry.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","I realize that this is somewhat early but I was wondering if you could give us any insight with respect to the ethylene plants coming online in the next few years. And if there is any ballpark for whether you\u2019re in any serious discussions with customers? I know in the past you\u2019ve mentioned that you were doing test runs with one potential company that\u2019s building a facility to move in polyethylene to Asia near the Port of L\u00e1zaro. Have there been any other discussions or developments like this with other potential customers and do you have any sort of broader thoughts on the role that rail could play in exports?","Dave Starling","The punch line I guess is still too early to quantify volume, revenue, routings all of that stuff. We are in serious discussions with a couple of producers. Still believe that this is going to be a very sizeable opportunity for us, both in potentially in hopper car business as well as intermodal picking up on what you said, we are having discussions with a couple of producers in the Gulf Coast really at the stretch between Houston and Corpus who are interested in loading these containers and\/or these products in intermodal containers for shipment to Mexico, South America and Asia.","So it\u2019s just too early to know how this is going to affect us but we are in pretty serious discussions with the couple of major producers and hopefully we\u2019ll have more to share on that over the course of the next few quarters. Believe it still is going to be a big opportunity for us and we\u2019ll have more information to share as we get more insight.","Pat Ottensmeyer"," ","Might add Allison that we do have property in that area, we think we are very strategically located with some of our yards in that area.","Dave Starling"," ","And again the timing of this as we\u2019ve indicated on the chart is really a 2016, 2017 for the bigger plants, bigger customers that we\u2019re talking too, these plants all take, facilities all take a long time to build and this is still two to three years out.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","I apologize for the multiple questions within the question. But if I could just squeeze one follow up and then this will be quick. But Pat I assume that when you\u2019re referring to the potential for more auto plants to be announced. Kia recently stated that its seriously considering building a 300,000 unit facility in Monterrey by 2017? I was wondering if you could share any thoughts on the probability of that.","Pat Ottensmeyer","","We\u2019ve read those reports, I think it\u2019s probably likely that there will be an announcement sometime soon but at this moment it\u2019s still not official.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","","Want to ask about the implications of the guidance for the third quarter. Is there anything unusual that\u2019s keeping you -- I think we all understand that the grain comps getting tougher, but grains, that was an easy comp and we shouldn\u2019t expect that going forward. But is low double-digit, low teens is without grain, is that the right way to think about the earnings growth going forward or is there something unusual in the comp or that you're not expecting this quarter that\u2019s limiting the earnings growth this quarter?","Pat Ottensmeyer"," ","Well Scott remember our guidance was for mid-teens EPS growth for the year and I did make a comment that we\u2019re at the upper end of that guidance. And if possible, we could do better than that depending on what happens with the grain shipments and coal. And the dark cores with coal as we\u2019ve seen over each of last two years with a significant customer and natural gas now being $4 I think it actually dip below 4. What impact is that going to have on our volumes? So those are the unknowns for us but don\u2019t read too much into that, we did say upper end of our mid-teens guidance.","Dave Starling"," ","I might add to that Scott, we wish we could tell you more about coal. We know the demand for coal is right now is high at the plants we have\u00a0because some of the stock piles are low, so if more coal could come through the pipeline, we could move it. So we don\u2019t control that and that\u2019s why we have to give you the message the way we are. If we control all the way to the origins we would probably be changing the guidance, but we don\u2019t so until we have a more clear picture of how that coal and grain and are going to move we think we\u2019re being very honest with you.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","And then just last question Dave or Jos\u00e9 on the line. Can you give us an update about on the legislative front of Mexico and what you\u2019re expecting in the back half of the year on that?","Dave Starling","Yes, I\u2019ll take that one and then Jos\u00e9 can comment. We are working with the government in Mexico today. We think we are making good progress. We think our message has been delivered on the importance of the railroads in Mexico. They are reading that loud and clear and we\u2019re very hopeful that we\u2019re going to come out with a good solution sometime later in the year. But right now I am not losing any sleep at night. Jos\u00e9.","Jose Zozaya","","I just complement that we are in a very much better position now that where we were at the beginning of all this discussion with the expectations that the senate starts again; we adjourned the discussions with them with a different point of view from senators and deputies.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christian Wetherbee of Citi. Please proceed with your questions.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","","Pat maybe we could just start maybe on the crude side. Just want to get a rough sense of sort of the walk up to Port Arthur's opening, (I guess you said) 16 potentially 17. You obviously have it as strategic growth initiatives starting in \u201815. Can you give us a little bit more detail on maybe some context of how we should think about that volume opportunity starting in \u201815 and others Beaumont Baton Rouge and a few other opportunities or a few other destinations opening up? Just give us some color around that that would be very helpful.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay, well as I mentioned we\u2019ve got a couple of facilities Beaumont, another facility possibly in the Nederland Port Arthur area and then Baton Rouge which we expect to start delivering crude, hopefully in the fourth quarter of this year. So we could see a ramp over the course of 2015 again depending on the timing of these facilities opening that could start with three to four trains a month and grow from there over the course of the year and then as the Port Arthur facility opens up, obviously that\u2019s going to add a lot of additional capacity. But I think it\u2019s going to be a bit of a slow ramp, could start seeing some things moving in the fourth quarter of this year and then into 2015 and just kind of ramping up over the course of the year.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and then may be a follow-up. Dave, just thinking of setback and thinking about the operations and open it through a margin potential or sort of potential of the business as you look out over the next couple of years as you are sort of going to be in-charge of this side of the business for a little bit of time here. How should be think about the opportunity? I know we have the 1 to 1.5 points for this year but when you look at sort of the other players in the industry and where they are sort of at or targeting from a margin perspective, is that something that you should be, is that sort of a target for you as well? Is that something we should be thinking in the same context, are there may be limitations or better opportunities?","Pat Ottensmeyer"," ","Well we've got some contracts in Mexico we will be working on this year on the locomotive side it will benefit us going into next year. But with the money that we we've Chirs on expansion capital and the locomotives we're adding. I think it\u2019s going to be a combination of revenue growth and improved operating metrics that our operating ratio should continue to improve. We've been very reluctant to throw some target out there where we are going to be five years from now. I think what we've done over the last five years coming from the 82s, down to the area of 67, I think we'll continue that march but we are not going to throw a target out there.","The other question you have that I think all of us have to be cautious of, if we have an opportunity to look at business that fits well in our network and is an area that we have a lot of capacity, you got to be careful that you are always looking at the operating ratio. Revenue and margin are wonderful things. So, I think we may take a little bit different look at it but there is no doubt we'll continue to improve. We are not going to set a goal out different than we've done in the past.","Operator","","The next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Mike, can I ask you to comment a little bit more on the CapEx, 28% of revenue it\u2019s a big number, presumably there is some equipment in there too. But you've only sort of targeted (Europe) [ph] 5% or so volume growth number. So, is this the anticipation of sort of 2015 and beyond having much higher growth rates in traffic or is this a catch up or is it just related to the equipment cost and will come back down to a more normal level?","Mike Upchurch","","Yes, Bill I think last quarter we talked a little bit more about the specific issue. We added -- we're ordering 85 new locomotives this year and certainly some of that\u2019s related to, they are all incremental by the way in that replacement because of our view of traffic on a longer term basis particularly going into 2015. And then remember the tier 4 requirements kick in on January 1, so these units are actually about 15% cheaper than the tier 4 and that was the reason we stepped up the capital this year. ","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","So, do you think you will be able to deploy these in a way that\u2019s going to be incremental or is this just because of a regulatory decision that you kind of hold forward some CapEx?","Dave Starling","","Bill, this is Dave. 45 of those locomotives will be delivered in the third and fourth quarter, so they are really being purchased going in to 2015. I don\u2019t know if you heard or not but we're being told that EMD will not build a tier 4 locomotive in 2016. So, you're going to have one supplier that\u2019s going to build locomotives in 2016, so all of us are very concerned that the order book is going to be filled and the volume is going to be there which we think it will. And the last thing we want to do is be short of locomotives and turning down revenues. So, we're going to be aggressive on locomotives for this year and you will see us into \u201816 as well. ","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Okay, fair enough. Thank you. The other question I had was on capacity and pricing, so when we look at a lot of the different parts of the overall transport network now, we're starting to see congestion and some tight capacity in various markets. Does the same go for cross-border and for Mexico? Are we seeing the kind of driver shortages and inability to get truck transportation there that would create either a more substantial volume opportunity for you or a pricing opportunity for you?","Dave Starling","","Not within Mexico, Bill, but certainly cross-border on the U.S. side. All of those factors are helping to drive our growth, so we think that we will have some benefits, some opportunities because of those factors on both driving our volume growth and the rate environment.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs ","","Hi. On the auto side, can you break out how much of the growth came from the new plant that opened in Mexico? And then to what extent the [indiscernible] facility contributes to growth that would be helpful? Thank you.","Dave Starling","We really don\u2019t breakout by customer or a facility, but clearly we\u2019re starting to see the three new plants ramp up, we did have some issues with one of them having a quality hold, but we don\u2019t really break that out. As far as the General Motors question, again I\u2019m not sure I understand your question about General Motors.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs ","It was just -- there was a line redesigned last year and I\u2019m just wondering to what extent we\u2019re now going to see that contribute to the growth as well?","Dave Starling","Well as I mentioned, it caused us some weakness in the second quarter of last year that we've quantified as 3.7 million that we think we lost last year because of some service issues, but going forward we should be back to kind of normal comps in the third and fourth quarter.","Mike Upchurch","Tom this is Mike. It was worth about 5 points on the growth rate, but that was then offset by the foreign exchange.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs ","Okay. That's great. And then just on the grain side, can you remind us what your mix is for cross-border and how much more I guess the length of haul actually is?","Mike Upchurch"," ","Our cross-border grain in the -- cross-border is about 52% of our total Ag and minerals business. And as I mentioned, year-over-year cross-border Ag and Min was up by 54% and grain was up by 89%. And the length of haul and the RPU were obviously significantly longer on our cross-border business than our domestic either U.S. or Mexico.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs ","Right. And suffice it to say with an anticipated record crop again sort of this harvest season, should we anticipate that the length of haul -- do you some have specific capacity constraints that would inhibit your ability to continued benefits from more shipments to Mexico and obviously better length of haul?","Mike Upchurch"," ","Well I think Dave in his comments that the Grain business is really going to be a function of the equipment availability not just on our local network, but across the industry and cycle times. So yes, I think with the inventories that are coming in to harvest and the harvest, the expectations for a very big crop, I think the whole industry is going to be somewhat constrained to handle and keep up with the grain demand.","","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen. I want to go back to coal and grain in the near-term here; you guys seem to be a little bit cautious due to some service issues in the rail network as a whole. If they don\u2019t improve considering its coal and considering its grain, could that just push where you guys actually start taking it on to maybe the fourth quarter?","Dave Starling","This is Dave. It's happened somewhat with grain into this quarter. Traditionally we would see a dip in grain, that's been fairly strong. As we said, the same thing could happen with coal. The other thing we don\u2019t quite have a handle on yet in talking to some of our regulated customers, the regulators actually control the stockpiles. So when the rail industry was very, very efficient, then the stockpiles were 30 days. So there is an expectation now that the regulators may say because you got so short this increase that we need to increase the stockpiles to 45 or 60 whatever that amount is. Now we don\u2019t have information that that's going to happen, but we know that many of our customers have gotten extremely low in their concern.","So that could be an opportunity even going into next year I\u2019m trying to rebuild the stockpiles and even increase the base stockpile. So if that happens that's going to be good for us, it will be good for the industry. ","Pat Ottensmeyer"," ","It could result in sort of a leveling out of what we have in both of those businesses of what we normally see as sort of the seasonal impact at least for the next six to nine months. ","Dave Starling"," ","Now having said that you got to look at the flip side of it, we have unregulated plants that are trying to compete with natural gas, and the way the price of natural gas is going down again. So it\u2019s such a mixed bag right now in coal. That's another reason that we are just reluctant to increase our guidance right now simply because of the uncertainty of what's going to happen in the coal world.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Okay, that's a good color guys, I appreciate that. And looking at a little bit longer term in terms of your capital needs, it looks like there is some longer term additional growth prospects that you guys have sort of added to your list. Where should we start thinking about the longer term CapEx levels for you guys and sort of where do you think that you might be constrained on either the equipment side or maybe even the yard side?","Dave Starling","Well, we\u2019ve always done our long-term five, in fact the five year plan now we roll it from a quarter to quarter rather than take a snapshot once a year. So we\u2019re looking at it quarter to quarter. We\u2019ll be adding capacity this year in four of our yards. We do it all in phases. So we\u2019ve got a five year plan for those yards so we kind of spread the capital, increase the capacity. We still have sidings we\u2019re adding, sidings we\u2019re extending. The one thing that we think we will get more aggressive on and it\u2019s because of the unit-trains is we will get more aggressive on locomotives because we have to have power. The railroad share power but when one railroad in another part of our interchange point gets tight on power then they\u2019re going to keep their power there. They don\u2019t share as well.","So we have to be cautious that we are not a victim of not having enough locomotives to take care of our own system when the other railroads that we work with get tight on their own power. So I think you\u2019re seeing all of us starting to spin more on locomotives. Because number one; the lead time will increase because and I\u2019ll correct myself earlier I said EMD, I am dating myself as progress rail has purchased EMD so I apologize [indiscernible]. But it is a progress rail, so they are pulling out of the market for one year on (two to four) [ph] you may see some short term decisions for the railroad (settlement) [ph] power. I know everyone was tight this year. And that\u2019s our life blood, you can\u2019t pull it with power. So, I think you\u2019re going to see us all purchasing power and making sure we have the sufficient amount even when our neighbors are constrained.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","But you didn\u2019t mention anything in the car side so you feel pretty good with your current car capacity?","Dave Starling","No, you\u2019ll see us working out with a long term plan, that we'll present to our Board in November that will be a long term car order and it will have grain cars, auto cars. We\u2019re looking across our commodity group, we don\u2019t see this growth slowing. And we\u2019re somewhat concerned that with what\u2019s happening in the crude by rail industry that they're going to take a lot of the shop capacity in the U.S., building crude cars so we got to make sure that we don\u2019t become a victim of not being able to get a car built. So we\u2019re going to have a long term strategy putting together our needs for the next one to five years. And we\u2019ll probably be able to talk more about that on our November fourth quarter call.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long - Stephens","First question, I wanted to ask about congestion. What do you view as the key to resolving the congestion issue right now? Is it more equipment that you just talked about? Is it investments in infrastructure? Or do you just need volumes to slow down a little bit to help balance the network?","Dave Starling","Well, we\u2019re against volume slowing down, so you can -- we definitely don\u2019t want that to happen, its capacity, its engines, its (cruise) [ph] and I think you\u2019re seeing the railroads cooperate with each other. We always have but I think we\u2019re very aware that we really are recognized as a system, as a network. So we\u2019re handing detours rather railroads on the line where we add capacity the other railroads are detouring some trains for us where they have capacity. So I think you\u2019re seeing the railroads work very well together and I applaud the BN for the billion dollars they\u2019ve committed to stand-up in the Bakken. I think there is a recent article of Matt Rose in Railway Age that would be worth reading, where Matt talks about the volume just getting out ahead of the infrastructure and how it just it came so fast it was impossible to keep up with it.","So we\u2019re all stepping up. I think there were four railroads, maybe five, that announced increasing their capital budget this year, so none of us are going to turn down volume or none of us are not going to react to the volume. So we\u2019re all going to spend what we need to do to handle the volume because I just don\u2019t see this railroad renaissance changing. This nation is not, this country is not spending money on the highways and bridges and I think the railroads are going to be rewarded for the capacity they\u2019re adding. I know we've been rewarded this year already. We have not had some of the problems the other lines have had\u00a0and I think it\u2019s because of our capacity program. So we\u2019re not going to slow down.","Justin Long - Stephens","Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow up in terms of resolving the congestion issue, do you think it's something that we could see in the next couple of quarters, does it take longer than that? And also how does all of this impact the pricing environment? You mentioned 3.6% pricing on renewals in the second quarter. Is that the best way to think about the pricing environment going forward? Or just given the tightness we\u2019re seeing in capacity across multiple modes of transportation. Could we see pricing accelerate over the next year?","Dave Starling","I think again looking at contracts that we\u2019re currently in negotiations with and renewing it feels like our customers are more interested in securing capacity than pushing for rate increases. I feel like we\u2019re kind of in an environment where we said the last few quarters low to mid-single digit pricing, pricing above inflation, I don\u2019t expect that to change much. On the capacity and the service issues, we have just got to improve that kind of separately from the rate and the pricing discussion that shippers are across all modes of transportation, trucking industry, you are hearing a lot more about capacity issues and rail business is strong and capacity is getting more valuable. So, that should equate to people, shippers being willing to do what it takes on the rate side to secure capacity.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Thanks guys and good morning. I am just going to actually going to keep it at one question here. Thinking about the cost side in the OR may be from a different angle. Mike, is there anything in the budget process that says well if we can sustain these growth rates, we do need to start taking headcount up, we need to start hiring ahead of this or when you laid out that initial guidance and I think you said in the last couple of calls, may be 100 basis points on the OR sustainable in the long run, if we get this type of better growth, can we see better leverage on that cost structure?","Mike Upchurch","","Yes, I think so. We've always guided to the 100 to 150 basis points and given where we are at right now, we are going to be towards the upper end of that range. I mean we always have opportunities to take cost out of the business and I think we have commented extensively on the leased equipment. We've talked about third-party maintenance agreements that are expiring over the next few years that we think we can take additional cost out but it really does largely become volume gain where you have a certain fixed cost structure here, so if the volumes are scaling up at these levels, it should be good for our operating ratio.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter, two quick questions. Number one, I know you've noted that you don\u2019t want to be out there with some target on the OR but I am just curious that with the amount of growth you've got coming on to the network, you played a very compelling case there. Is there any likelihood that may be that OR improvement takes a bit of a hiatus, as that volume ramps up and then begins to reaccelerate as you reach some critical level of volume in each of these opportunities?","Dave Starling"," ","That\u2019s a good point. There is no doubt there is stair stepping and when the volume comes, when does it come, I mean we have the gateway from Kansas City to St. Louis which is a very underutilized and in the last two years we've seen the business triple on that line. So, when you can do that on an existing asset that goes straight to the bottom-line, not straight to the bottom-line, but it's got a very good margin when you are on-boarding traffic in an area that\u2019s challenged then it can cause your cost to go up.","So, yes there is no doubt you will get into some stair stepping but I think that\u2019s just part of the business that always happens but we think operating ratio will continue to improve and there is a lot of levers involved in the operating ratio as Mike explained.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then in terms of the CapEx, you talked about the five year plan, so I have got two questions there. Number one, is your five year plan given these growth opportunity you see, CapEx elevated at this 20% of revenue for that period of time or does it begin to scale back at some point during your forecast period? And then given there is this mix of growth between Mexico and the U.S., how do you ensure that what\u2019s necessary in Mexico doesn\u2019t somehow capital star the U.S. operation?","Dave Starling"," ","Well, we look at it as one railroad. We don\u2019t look at it as Mexico and the U.S. in fact our challenge is that Laredo is just another point on the map. So, locomotives run through, the cars run through when we look at our capacity model from Mexico City to Kansas City, we don\u2019t stop looking at it at Laredo. So, it\u2019s all the same pool of capital. The volume growth right now if you look at our one (arrow) [ph] chart that shows the continued growth we're going to have through 17, 18, 19, 20, we're going to put in the necessary amount of capital to make sure we can handle that volume. I mean it\u2019s a great story for us, one thing I love about our Board, they've never gotten concerned about capital as long as the revenue growth is with it.","So, we don\u2019t apologize for capital. We'll just tell you that our maintenance capital is coming down, one time we were about 11% of our revenue also on maintenance. We've got that down to 9%. We think it will come down to about 8.5% because our network is stable. We have invested a lot in it, so the other capital that we're going to spend is going to be for growth. So, we're going to spend the amount we need. We'll look at the equipment but then there is still be a driver on what that capital spend will be based on locomotives. You got to have the power to pull these unit trains. I think the other roads are -- everyone is discovering that. You can\u2019t -- you got to have the locomotives.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","","I am just going to beat the CapEx horse here a little bit more. Most of the questions have been answered but may as well ask one, right. You've talked about the locomotive aspect of the capital plan for the next couple of years. But as we entertain the idea of energy reforms, say two to three years out. As we look at some of these new complexes coming into Louisiana. What are the kinds of capital investment which you have to make to prepare for the growth?","Dave Starling"," ","It will be the yards, it will also be double tracking, extending sightings CTC. It will be all those things that help maintain our velocity. So true locomotives is just one item but the reason I think I mentioned locomotives so much, there is two manufacturers out there. We just got to make sure that we stay in the queue and don\u2019t get smothered by the big guys. I mean I think BN ordered 500 locomotives. So KCS comes to the table and says I need 25, you might be in trouble. So we've got to be very thoughtful on how we plan our locomotive purchases.","The rest of it we control, the sightings, building, the yards we don\u2019t have to go to a manufacturer to do that. The rails available, the tires are available, that\u2019s your own workforce or contractors. So that\u2019s what you\u2019ll see us concentrating on and we have a very robust capacity team that meets every quarter and starts to make the determination on how we stay out ahead of the volume.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","So I guess given the way BN is investing to alleviate its own capacity shortages. I guess what you\u2019re getting at is until 2017 the rest of the industry\u2019s ability to add locomotive power is going to be somewhat constraint?","Dave Starling"," ","No I didn\u2019t mean that, I just meant we have to be careful on what is out there. In other words, this year because of some credits they had, two of the railroads are still ordering some tier three locomotives because of credits they had. So I think we just all have to be cautious on what is going to be available not only on the locomotive side but on the car side. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting out ahead, we\u2019re actually -- we\u2019re placing orders for locomotives now for 2015.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tyler Franz with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","","I know I have kind of asked this before, but where do you stand from your cash tax paying status both in the U.S. and Mexico. It seems like you\u2019re still fairly sheltered, maybe when that might abate?","Mike Upchurch","We are, we\u2019re paying a higher cash tax rate in Mexico right now than we are in the U.S. and I don't know if you have followed some of the legislative focus on the short line tax credit and the bonus depreciation right now our view is that before the end of the year there is a likelihood that that will pass bonus depreciation as an example would allow us to push out another 100 plus million dollars of cash taxes for a couple of more years. So it\u2019s pretty substantial for us. And you\u2019re right the cash tax rate's still quite low.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","And then Dave, Pat, just kind of a big picture question, but you\u2019ve got this outsize growth in the cross-border volume. The fact that you\u2019re tonne miles still continue to outpace the carload growth. Is it safe to assume that your length of haul continues to go up maybe even to call it record levels? And when you look ahead and we think about modeling, shouldn\u2019t this kind of again generally speaking put an upward bias on your revenue per car? Maybe even productivity or even margins?","","Dave Starling"," ","So I\u2019ll cover the revenue, yes as our cross-border business continues to grow intermodal automotive, you have the revenue per car is obviously going to grow. Our revenue per unit on our cross-border is significantly higher than what you see in terms of the domestic Mexico and domestic U.S. So we should see and I think you've seen it over the last several quarters our average revenue per car has continued to move up. And it\u2019s not just intermodal and automotive, we\u2019re seeing good growth in steel and obviously the grain business but that\u2019s kind of recovering from the drought more than growth.","Pat Ottensmeyer"," ","And I\u2019ll speak to the length of haul, I think some of the issues on the length of haul for us are a lot of our unit trains, because they\u2019re governed by the loading and unloading facilities. So a lot of our unit trains we don\u2019t see a big change some of the crude and grain trains for instance because of again the facilities, the origins are the destinations.","Operator","And then coming from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","","My first question is a follow up on the [indiscernible] line, in terms of the impact of strategic growth areas, especially cross-border intermodal and automotive on margins. You addressed the positive impact on pricing. How about the impact on margins from just the one-sided nature of traffic and maybe the function required to sustain the high volume growth rates.","Dave Starling"," ","Well right now it\u2019s the impact on margins so particularly I think intermodal is pretty -- is very strong because we have capacity on existing trains. So when we add additional containers, the incremental margin is very high. You\u2019re really -- you're not adding more locomotives, you\u2019re not adding crews, you\u2019re adding a little bit of fuel.","As we grow we will get to the point where we will have to add new train starts, we don\u2019t see that in the near future, but certainly as we grow we continue to get the conversion that we expect. We will add new train starts which could, Dave mentioned the kind of stair step effect we could see a situation where our incremental margins decline as we add costs and add trains, but that will improve our capacity and improve our velocity and train performance and transit times, which should also help drive some of the growth.","So we fully expect that there will be some of that stair stepping in the future, but right now and for the foreseeable future as we add intermodal volume, the incremental margin is quite high.","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","Thank you very much. And my follow-up relates to the petchem opportunity related to Mexico, U.S. specifically how is this new plant [indiscernible] going to affect your traffic now closer border with Mexico in case you are involved or helping out the Mexico imports of derivative of polyethylene products from the U.S. and maybe on the positive could you participate in global exports from that plant out of Mexico?","Dave Starling","Possibly. It\u2019s hard to know how that's going to affect us; I mean the markets -- the large market is growing. We don\u2019t see it having a big impact on our shipments cross-border from the U.S. to Mexico. Again as I mentioned, it\u2019s a growing market and we just don\u2019t expect it to have a major impact. But clearly as more capacity comes on, we could see some shift in sourcing. But as you mentioned, there could be export opportunities, there are even opportunities for us to move intra-Mexico from that facility, so it's an unknown, but it\u2019s a large market and we expect to see growth there across all of our plants.","Operator","Thank you. And Mr. Starling I would like to turn the floor back to you for closing comments.","Dave Starling","Okay. Thanks everyone for being on the call, it\u2019s been a long call so I\u2019ll be kind to everyone and not have any closing comments other than thank you for your participation. We felt like we had a great quarter and we think we\u2019re going to have a great back half of the year. So thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David Starling","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to the Kansas City Sothern's first quarter conference call. Today's presenters joining me on the call are Pat Ottensmeye, our recently named President, who will primarily be concentrating on the performance of our business units today.","Jeff Songer, our Chief Transportation Officer; Mike Upchurch, our Chief Financial Officer and on the phone from Mexico will be Jose Zozaya, our President and Executive Representative, who will be able to answer questions specific to Mexico.","Let's look at the first quarter overview. As we disclosed in our earnings preannouncement on March 23rd, we are facing some challenges so far in 2015. Some of the challenges were expected going into the year and some quite frankly have been a bit more difficult than we anticipated.","Due to the combined impacts of foreign exchange, lower fuel surcharge revenues and carload declines in a few commodity areas, KCS consolidated revenue declined 1% from the first quarter of 2014.","Without the impact of weaker peso and lower fuel surcharge revenues consolidated revenues would have been up 4%. The performance of our key strategic growth areas was a mixed bag.","On the positive side, crude revenues were up 94%, so of course that was off a very small base. L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas was up 30% and automotive was up 4%.","Automotive revenues were certainly impacted by a lower peso. If the peso's value versus the dollar was where it was a year ago, our automotive revenues would have been up 15% for the quarter.","Cross-border intermodal, while up 2%, they experienced considerably lower growth than in previous quarters, mainly as a result of service and equipment issues that are being worked out. Jeff Songer will provide more color.","On the negative side, frac sand revenues were down 12%, primarily due to the reduction of drilling in the Eagle Ford Basin. The combined revenues for the five strategic growth areas grew by 8% in the first quarter.","At last year's peso-dollar exchange rate the combined growth rate would have been up 14%. Finally, weaker than expected volumes resulted in KCS's first quarter operating ratio increasing slightly from a year ago to 68.9, compared to 68.7 in 2014.","The update for the first quarter, back in January, we gave full year mid-single digit volume guidance for the year. Our first quarter volumes trail that projection growing only 1% in the quarter. The main culprit was utility coal. There was also weakness in the few other areas, which Pat will discuss more in depth in a few minutes.","When we laid out the guidance for you in January, we actually thought that we might come in on the upper level of mid-single digit volume growth. That belief was seemingly validated by our January carloads which came in up 7%, but the environment changed quickly and dramatically in February and March.","While we see a path that can get us to a mid-single digit carload growth for the year, we certainly have to acknowledge the uncertainty surrounding the energy market, particularly with respect to utility coal, crude and frac sand.","In addition, service issues and equipment availability still persist on our railroad as well as in other parts of the U.S. rail systems that are exerting pressure on our intermodal and automotive traffic, especially on our cross-border business.","In light of these challenges, we have begun to take actions to scale back expenses both, operating and capital spending. To ensure that KCS achieves maximum possible profitability during what we hope is a relatively breath period of market turbulence. Jeff Songer will have more comments on our cost controls and efforts to improve service and equipment availability, especially with respect for our cross border traffic.","Because volumes were strong in January, we did not begin to scale spending meaningfully until mid-March. Therefore, the positive impacts of our actions will be seen over the remainder of the year.","In our March 23 pre-announcement, we lowered the 2015 revenue estimate for mid single-digit to low single-digit reflecting the decline in volume from our January guideline, along with further impacts from foreign exchange and lower fuel prices.","As I noted earlier for the first quarter, consolidated revenues were 1% lower than last year. Uncertainties in the energy market will certainly impact our revenues for the remainder of the year.","Finally in January, we provided a three-year operating ratio targeted low 60s. With 11 quarters still to go, we feel there is absolutely no reason we should back off that projection at this time.","Barring economic downturn, we still feel good about moving into that neighborhood by the end of 2017.","With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer for an operations' update.","Jeff Songer","Thank you, Dave, and good morning. Beginning with Slide 8, productivity as measured by carloads per employee fell by approximately 4% in the first quarter versus the first quarter of 2014. As indicated in the slide, we typically see production dip in the first quarter.","Further illustrated on Slide 9, this drop in productivity was pronounced in February of volume shifted from a 7% increase in January to a 2% decline in February. Actions to reduce crews lag the sudden decrease in volume for February. The productivity rebounded through March as crew management efforts took effect.","Turning to Slide 10, operating metrics were sustained in Q1, and we continue to rebound some depressed 2014 levels. While we continue as an industry leader in the operating metrics of velocity and dwell, our numbers have not rebounded forward to those of Q1 2014, primarily in the metric of Bluffs [ph]","Impacts to service in Q1 were primarily related to maintenance away work in our Southwest corridor, including work on the International Bridge at Laredo Texas and across the Laredo subdivision. This work impacted dwell and yards in both, the U.S. and Mexico.","Ongoing maintenance away work by interchange carriers in the same region also had an impact.","Mexico prove availability also had an impact of hiring lag or higher than anticipated attrition. The north end of our railroad, including the Kansas City interchange, continues to improve as the industry has felt less of an impact of the mild Chicago winter.","Weather did have an impact to our intermodal operation in the Dallas area, where the winter ice storm created a backlog across highways and restricted the flow of equipment into the market and subsequently impacted our ability to flow equipment to the domestic market as well as into Mexico.","Slide 11, outlines additional cost management activities we are pursuing. Currently, we have furloughed T&E personnel in those areas impacted by energy volumes, but we will continue to staff adequately to support the growth our [ph] business units.","Locomotive purchase in 2014 and 2015 have provided greater flexibility to manage our overall power position. Our upgraded fleet will allow us to reduce maintenance costs through storing less efficient and higher maintenance units and has provided this additional capacity to surge as business requires.","Cross-border fueling initiatives have allowed us to capitalize on lower price of fuel in the U.S. We have added additional fueling resources at both of our Laredo and Matamoros gateways to handle more southbound fueling. In addition, northbound trains are moved to the border with lower fee levels and refueled in the U.S.","New locomotive fuel optimization test have been conducted this quarter and we will begin with a larger scale implementation of these products throughout the year. Initial results were promising for greater fuel efficiencies. Contractor conversions in our IT department and mechanical shops will allow for reduce costs in those areas.","Regarding capital expenditures, we have delayed the start for some capacity expansion projects related to energy. However, we will complete the engineering design and obtain required permits for those projects, so that they are shovel-ready when the additional capacity is required.","We will monitor our capital spending as the year progresses, but we will continue to support our growth such as with the purchase of new automotive and grain equipment and we will continue to invest in our core mainline infrastructure.","Before I close, I would like to briefly discuss our two largest ongoing projects. Our new intermodal facility in Dallas, Texas will open in July. Once complete, we will move operations of our existing facility, which is inefficient given the track layout and limited parking capacity. This new facility will provide 75% more parking capacity and 75% more track space. Additionally, we will have a state-of-the-art gate system to facilitate traffic flow in and out of the facility.","The second project is expansion of our yard at Sanchez, Mexico, just south of the border at Laredo. The construction of additional receiving and departing tracks has begun with additional classification tracks and mechanical facility slated for 2016 and 2017. This expansion will allow for improved fluidity for cross-border movements and will reduce dwell time at our current new Laredo and Sanchez facilities.","I will now turn the presentation over to our President, Pat Ottensmeye.","Pat Ottensmeye","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 13. As you saw earlier, total revenue for the quarter was $603.1 million or about 1% below first quarter of last year.","You will notice on this slide, we have added a gray bar for each business unit showing the impact of declining U.S .fuel prices and a weakening peso. On a consolidated basis, these two factors combined for about a 5% revenue reduction, so core line haul revenues for the quarter were about 4% higher than last year.","We moved 540,000 carloads during the quarter or about 1% more than last year. Revenue per unit was 2% below 2014. Again, you can see the impact of fuel and foreign-exchange and RPU in the chart on this slide. Core pricing continue to be strong at 4.2%. I will talk more about that in a few minutes.","Before I get into detail for each business unit, let me start by saying that in addition to fuel and foreign-exchange, a significant driver for the weakness during the quarter was related to lower oil and gas prices, which adversely impacted revenues and volume in utility coal, frac sand and metals used for drilling pipe.","The decline in utility coal and frac sand together represented about $15 million of revenue reduction from last year or about 2% on a consolidated basis. Going back to the slide, our chemical and petroleum business was strong during the quarter with revenues increasing by 9% and volumes by 8%.","We had strength across most segments of this business unit with petroleum and plastics showing the largest gain. As you can see from the gray bar, fuel and FX combined for 4% reduction in revenue and the majority of this was foreign-exchange as one of our largest and fastest-growing customers in Mexico is a peso denominated account.","Moving to industrial and consumer business revenues and volumes both decline by 3% and 2%, respectively, from last year. Metals and scrap more than accounted for the total reduction in both, revenue and volume in this business unit. As I mentioned earlier, reduced demand for drilling pipe was a significant factor to that decline.","In addition, we saw weakness due to higher level of foreign steel imports into both, U.S. and Mexico. On the positive side, our pulp and paper and lumber business were both strong during the quarter, driven by increased demand and improve boxcar supply for paper shipments compared to last year.","Ag and minerals, revenue and volumes declined by 7% and 3%, respectively. Grain was a headline story here as we did see strength in food products in ores and minerals segments.","Grain more than accounted for the entire reduction in this business unit with revenues and volumes declining by 17% and 13%, respectively. There are a few key drivers for the declining grain during the quarter, including higher seasonal purchases of domestic corn in Mexico, which display some of the cross-border business that we would normally have expected to handle in the first quarter. There was a loss of business that was available to KCF last year, due to the congestion issues across the North American rail network and that business has now moved back to other historical routing patterns.","Third, the amplified impact of lower fuel prices as a number of our cross-border grain contracts are tied to WTI, which as you all know experienced a more rapid decline in highway diesel. These three factors combined accounted for about 75% of the total reduction in grain revenues during the quarter. I will talk about the outlook for this business in a few moments, but we do expect improvement for this business over the course of the year.","Our energy business units saw revenues fall by 15% on a 9% reduction volume. Our utility coal revenues fell by about 26% over last year and that was driven, primarily by reduce shipments to one of our larger customers from stronger than anticipated first quarter volume last year to very low volumes this year. This was the function of the dramatic drop in natural gas prices over the past year, making coal uncompetitive for this customer's.","Our frac sand business also saw decline with revenues and volumes lower by 11% and 7%, and this was due to lower drilling activity in the South Texas, primarily the Eagle Ford areas Dave mentioned.","Our crude oil business showed good momentum in the quarter with a 90% increase in revenues, admittedly from a fairly small base last year. We still expect crude oil shipments to strengthen over the course of the year, however as we stated in our March 23rd press release at a reduced level from our January outlook.","Obviously, there are many factors beyond our control here, including the price of crude oil which remains a complete wildcard and the ramping up the facilities that we are serving, so our forecast for the remainder of the year may be continued to be a moving target.","Moving onto intermodal, we saw revenue grow by 8% on a 4% increase in volume. As you will see in a couple minutes and as Dave mentioned, our cross-border revenue grew by only 2% during the quarter. While it is difficult to quantify as Jeff Songer mentioned, some of the weaknesses related to winter storm in Dallas, which disrupted the availability of containers and railcars flowing into Mexico needed to support our cross-border business. This also affected our domestic intermodal service in the Dallas to the Southeast lanes during the quarter.","As Jeff mentioned, service issues caused by maintenance work around the border and crew availability in Mexico also negatively impacted our growth during the quarter. The bright spot here was in our L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas business, where we saw a 30% revenue growth from last year, due to an overall increase in import and export activity at Lazaro, as well as some market share gains relative to truck.","Finally, our automotive business saw revenues grow by 4% on an 8% increase in volume. As you can see, again on that on the gray bar, FX had a significant impact on revenue in this business as the majority of our contracts are denominated in pesos. As Dave mentioned, if the peso had remained flat to last year, our revenue growth would have been 15% in this business over 2014 levels.","Mexico finished vehicle production continues to be strong and expected to grow by about 10% for the full-year as new plants opened in 2014 to continue to ramp up their production. We know that high capacity utilization and extended cycle times in the entire North American railcar fleet had a negative impact on our business during the quarter.","Finished vehicles on the ground in Mexico are running well above desired levels and if cycle times and equipment availability improve, we believe, some of the business that we may have missed in the first quarter could be made up in the next few weeks.","The longer-term outlook for automotive growth remains very strong give recent announcements by Volkswagen, Toyota and Ford, regarding new investments in Mexico.","Moving Slide 14, you can see our cross-border revenues decreased by 4% over last year. However, adjusting for fuel and foreign-exchange, we would have shown a 2% increase. Cross-border volumes fell by 1%. Again, grain more than accounted for the total reduction in cross-border revenues for some of the same reasons I mentioned earlier.","On the positive side, our cross-border automotive volumes increased by 23% and FX adjusted revenues were up 35% higher than last year. Cross-border petroleum shipments also increased as we gained new refined product shipments from Mexico.","On Slide 15, we show you the growth in our strategic growth areas. As Dave mentioned earlier, which was 8% versus last year, again Dave mentioned, this was a mixed bag and you can see the significant impact that foreign-exchange had on our automotive growth during the quarter. Again, adjusting for the FX impact, total revenue growth from these five businesses would have been 14% higher than last year.","As I mentioned earlier, cross-border intermodal growth was impacted by equipment availability, maintenance and service issues, which we are confident will improve in the month ahead. The decline in frac sand is a function of reduced drilling activity in Eagle Ford area.","On Slide 16, we show the full-year outlook for line haul revenue by business unit. As I mentioned earlier, for the first quarter, line haul revenue excluding fuel and foreign-exchange increased by 4% from 2014.","The column on the far right on this slide shows the business unit outlook, if we include the expected impact of reduced fuel surcharge revenue and further deterioration of the peso in accordance with current futures curves. This is consistent with the way you see the business unit reports on Slide 13.","You can see going back to line haul revenue that we have made two changes to our outlook compared to what we reported in January. Based on weaker forecast for utility coal, frac sand and crude oil, we are reducing the full-year outlook in our energy business units from double-digit to single-digit line haul revenue growth.","We are expecting growth in crude oil business that as we reported in March at a reduced level from our original outlook. As we have all learned, there is probably more uncertainty in this business than perhaps any other segment of our portfolio, so this could continue to be a moving target over the remainder of the year.","We are also reducing our full-year outlook for intermodal based on actual first quarter performance, which was weaker than we expected and some continued equipment and crew availability challenges, which will likely have a lingering impact on second quarter growth rates, particularly for our cross-border product.","You can see we are expecting ag and minerals business to turn positive for the full year as we believe some of the timing factors that I mentioned earlier will turn into positives. In addition, our expectation is the comps later in the year could be stronger, due to additions to our hopper car fleet and service improvements from last year. All of the other business units are very much in line with first quarter results and previous guidance.","Finally, on Slide 17, you can see a little more color on the outlook by business for the remainder of 2015, and I will mix in some longer-term perspective here as well. As I mentioned before, the pricing environment continues to be strong and we expect that to continue. Core pricing based on contracts renewed during the quarter was a positive 4.2%.","As we show on this slide, we feel there are positive trends and about 60% of our total portfolio of business that we expect will drive revenue and volume improvements for the rest of the year.","I have already touched on equipment and maintenance and crew issues that negatively impacted our cross-border intermodal business and we believe all of those factors will improve in the next few months.","L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas growth has been strong, and while growth rates may decline from first quarter levels, we expect solid gains for the full year. The long-term outlook for L\u00e1zaro remains very positive as we believe there will be opportunities for diversion of traffic from LA Long Beach, particularly to the Houston market, beginning in 2016. In addition, the new APM terminal is expected to open in May of next year and will bring substantial new capacity to the port.","The opening of our Wylie, intermodal terminal outside of Dallas that Jeff mentioned, is scheduled for July of this year and will put us in great position for growth in our domestic intermodal product Dallas to the Southeast to and from the Southeast with that facility.","Immediately upon opening the facility, our capacity will increase by about 75% for the Dallas market and then substantially improve the efficiency and service components of that operation as well.","Demand for finished vehicles continues to be strong and near-term improved equipment availability to provide a bit of a surge in volumes in first quarter levels. Recent announcements of new facilities in Mexico should drive automotive growth for many years to come.","New crude oil facility should put us in a growth position for the rest of the year, but as I mentioned earlier there is tremendous amount of uncertainty in this area and we just do not know what the future holds for crude oil pricing and how that will impact our business.","On the unfavorable side, we see continued weakness in coal, frac sand and metals. These three business units represent about 30% of our total portfolio and we are large contributors to our weakness in the first quarter. Based on current commodity prices, we see no basis for significant improvement in utility coal, frac sand or steel for drilling pipe, so we are expecting these businesses to remain unfavorable for the rest of the year.","Before I turn the presentation over to Mike, I would just like to reiterate that we continue to believe the long-term growth prospects for Kansas City Southern are very good. Positive long-term fundamentals are still in place for automotive growth, cross-border trucking conversion L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas expansion and growth, new ethylene plants being built in the Gulf coast among other areas.","Clearly, lower energy prices are having a negative near-term impact on some of our businesses, but should be positive for future economic growth. We still believe that KCS is very well positioned for growth for many years to come.","Now, I will turn the presentation over to Mike.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. I am going to start my comments on Slide 19. First quarter volumes grew 1% and revenue declined 1%. As Pat previously discussed, our revenue growth rate when adjusting for a constant foreign currency exchange rate in fuel price would have been 4%.","Adjusted operating ratio did increased 20 basis points to 68.9% and is reflective of an environment of declining year-over-year volumes in February and March, while operating costs scaling lags.","As Jeff indicated earlier, we are intensely focused on scaling our cost while keeping longer-term growth opportunities in our sites. Adjusted diluted EPS declined from $1.5 a year ago to $1.3 for the first quarter of 2015. This decline is primarily related to the decline in revenues in the deferred impact of scaling costs. We have included more income details in the appendix related income taxes, FX hedge gains and losses, and the resulting offsetting income tax benefits experienced in the first quarter and would expect to see throughout the remainder of the year and I would be glad to answer any questions once we get to Q&A.","On Slide 20, I did want to quickly remind investors and analysts as we discussed contrast earnings conference is investor conferences. We have a natural hedge in our operating section of our income statement, where peso denominated revenues and expenses largely offset each other as you can see in the second column and that the operating income impact of changes in foreign currency had a net $100,000 benefit to the first quarter.","Moving to Slide 21, adjusted operating expenses decreased 1%, but were up 2% when excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Declines in fuel prices in the U.S. were offset by higher compensation expense from increased headcount and wage inflation, higher casualty expense and increased appreciation due to capital expenditures.","We continue to experience lower equipment costs as a result of our leased asset conversion program and I will make some additional comments on that on the remaining slides.","We would point out that the higher casualty expenses were combination of slightly increased cargo damage expense, increased environmental expenses, reserves and the impact of the favorable credit in the first quarter of 2014.","Moving to Slide 22, compensation expense increased 6%, primarily from higher headcount, wage inflation and slightly higher incentive payments related to prior year performance.","Compensation expense did benefit by $4 million from weaker peso and the bar chart, you can see our average quarterly headcount was up 4%, due to increases in transportation, engineering and mechanical.","As Jeff mentioned earlier, we continue to monitor, demand and staff accordingly, and we currently have approximately 5% of our US transportation employees under furlough [ph] today.","Moving to Slide 23, fuel expense declined $23 million or 22% largely the result of lower U.S. fuel prices and weaker peso. The average price per gallon as you can see in the bar chart, in the U.S. and in Mexico were $1.85 and $3.05, respectively.","Government policies have not kept pace with global fuel prices and thus we haven't experienced the same benefit to fuel expense as other U.S. and Canadian rail carriers may have seen during the quarter.","Moving to Slide 24, our fuel lag benefit was $6 million for the quarter on a consolidated basis. That represented $7 million positive in the U.S., but $1 million negative in Mexico.","As you know, we have been experiencing monthly price increases in Mexico over the past one to two years, but that price increase did stop in February and we would expect fuel prices to stay at current levels for the foreseeable future until any new policy may be adopted, thus we would expect the negative lag we have been experiencing in Mexico to subside during the second quarter.","Moving to Slide 25, equipment costs continued to decline as a result of the benefit of purchasing equipment under lease, partially offsetting the equipment expense declines was depreciation, but the net impact of the quarter was $3 million favorable. We did experience a $2 million increase in our car hire expense, due to more equipment online in Mexico from some congestion issues as Jeff indicated.","Lastly, depreciation increased $5 million, due to a larger asset base from our capital expenditure program.","Lastly, on Slide 26, let me review our capital structure and cash flow priorities. In response to declining volumes, we are reducing our capital expenditures for 2015 from our original guidance of $700 million to $720 million, down to $650 million to $670 million.","Most of the reductions were due to scaling back capacity project to better match when that anticipated volume growth will experience.","Our Board of Directors did approve the first quarter dividend, which was paid on April 8th. Our annualized dividend is now a $1.32 per share, which is up 69% from the dividend we initiated back in 2012.","Finally, we purchased another $54 million of leased equipment in the first quarter, which brings our ownership equipment to 55%. To remind you when we started this program a few years ago, we were under 20%. We continue to believe, we have more room to purchase equipment during 2015 and move closer to industry averages of 65% to 70% ownership.","Since we initiated or improved our capital structure a few years ago, we have now acquired nearly $700 million of rolling stock and lowered our OR by close to 200 basis points.","With that, let me turn the call back over to Dave.","David Starling","Thanks, Mike. This closing comment goes without saying that our first quarter was not everything we had hoped it would be, but without discounting the secular challenges we faced in the quarter and still face today, I think it is important to put the negatives into context.","As we have noted this morning, the single biggest factor impacting our quarter was utility coal and really within that commodity group, there was only one customer on the unregulated Texas electric energy market struggled to compete against low natural gas prices.","The fact is, this may continue to be a challenge for them and for us, but we have already scaled back our costs related to that business. We have also been faced with challenges coming from our metal and steel commodity group from the effect of lower crude prices on certain commodities, particularly frac sand and steel.","As Pat stated, imports are also affecting our steel sector. There is no question that the unsettled energy markets have had a significant impact on the first four months of 2015. Unfortunately, there is no crystal ball that can tell us what the impact of energy will be in the next eight months.","All I can say is that KCS will manage the situation in a way that will provide the best financial results possible, no matter what the circumstances end up being. As we have done in the past, we will do what we need to do to make sure that KCS will end 2015 stronger and more profitable than it was when we entered.","Finally, and most importantly, we are not backing off at all from our belief in commitment to our longer-term growth. Last week's announcement from Toyota, their intention to build a plant in Mexico and [ph] groundbreaking ceremony in late March for their Lake Charles ethylene plant represents a kind of business expansion opportunities that continue to excite us about KCS's future.","With that, I will open the presentation up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Kim from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Kim","Thanks very much. I have a longer-term question. Can you update us on the energy reform within Mexico? Then given what has happened oil prices has interest sort of future investment changed at all? Thanks.","David Starling","The energy reform in Mexico, the timing of some of the activities is still bit unclear. They are proceeding with the first offshore bid package. What we are hearing is that there is still significant interest in part potential participant in that market, but too early to know how the bids are going to work out.","Again, most of the companies that are looking at getting into those areas are taking extremely long-term views as a lot of the other energy-related investments so again it's a little too soon to tell how the results of some of the bids will go, but we still feel that there is substantial interest.","Tom Kim","Okay. Then I have a question with regard to coal. Can you talk about where you think inventories are with regard to one of your key customers? If you can help us try to frame out what the coal outlook would be like if for example nat gas prices were to stay where they are could we assume that there is further coal sort of cuts, some expectations or do you think that the baseline in Q1 is sort of a sustainable rate going forward and the declines are off of that. Thank you.","David Starling","I think it is the latter comment that I think for the full-year this may be kind of a baseline. We could see some - a lot of it depends on the weather in Texas, particularly what kind of summer we have that they could change the burn rates, but based on our current expectations, we do not see a lot of improvement to our coal business for the full-year versus the first quarter.","Tom Kim","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Allison Landry from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could help us think about the cadence of volume growth for the balance of the year to get to your mid single-digit growth target, recognizing comps are more difficult in the second quarter, and thinking about sort of the weakness in utility coal and shale-related commodities exclude. Would you expect volumes to be down potentially in Q2 and then rebound in the second half?","David Starling","I think, we will see strength for the rest of the year, Allison. As I mentioned in the ag and minerals business. I think, particularly in the second half, we could see some improvements there.","Intermodal and automotive, because of some of the issues that both, Jeff and I mentioned with the maintenance and crews and equipment, we feel that there will be some strength over the course of the year there; and even in energy, and I know the crystal ball on crude oil is very cloudy for everyone, notwithstanding what you said about coal, we are still expecting to see crude oil growth over the course of the year based on the facilities that has opened the Edmonton facility that is going to open in May, I believe, so we still expect to see some growth in crude oil offsetting some of the decline in coal and ag, intermodal and automotive, based on improved cycle times and service.","Allison Landry","Okay. That is helpful. Then just sort of following up on that thinking about improvement towards the back half of the year and maybe pushing that out a little bit and thinking about the longer-term sort of earnings growth trajectory for the business.","Could you help us sort of get comfortable with sort of your thoughts on can earnings get back to double digits next year? How do we think about that given all the puts and takes that we are seeing right now?","Mike Upchurch","Well, Allison, this is Mike. I will take a stab at that. Obviously, we have a lot of pluses and minuses here as you can see in the release and with a lot of uncertainty around a significant part of the business that Pat indicated, but if there was a little bright lighting crude prices are interestingly enough moving back up a little bit. We will see whether that has any kind of positive impact, but given volume growth back to original levels, I do think that's feasible.","It's been a challenging quarter as we talked about starting the year with some 7% volume growth in January. Then the dropped that we have seem in February, March and month to-date in April mix makes the scaling a little bit more difficult, but on the way up the incremental should be quite positive and I think that is possible.","David Starling","Allison, this is David, if I might add on the crude, you know, we have been working hard to get all the destinations ready. In March, we install the switch, they gave us access to Genesis in Baton Rouge. We been down at the facility in the Port of Beaumont, and they have got multiple receiving tracks they are ready. We have been moving some product to Sunoco they are ready neither [ph] land is ready, so I guess all I can tell you right now the destinations are ready. We just need the price to get to a point where we start to see more movements, but from a physical standpoint there is nothing stopping us from moving a hell of a lot of crude.","Allison Landry","Okay. Just sort of lastly if you think about the where current Street expectations are for 2016 is, is that a number that you are comfortable with?","David Starling","We are not going to comment on 2016.","Allison Landry","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. All right. Thank you for the time.","David Starling","Good try, Allison.","Allison Landry","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","David Starling","Good morning.","Chris Wetherbee","Just a quick question, I won't dwell on this too much, just want to maybe understand a little bit better sort of the difference between sort of the outlook in late March and kind how you came in for the full quarter. You were, I think, flat to slightly up and we were a little bit down. I guess, I do not want to dwell too much on it. It is just sort of a slight change, but was there anything that kind of changed in the last month of the quarter that may be impacted that?","Mike Upchurch","Yes. Chris, it is Mike. You know, obviously, we did not close the books for the quarter on March 23rd when we did the preannouncement. At that point in time, we were flat in revenues and obviously based on the full quarter, things tailed off a bit in the back half and it is really just back half of the first quarter, just a continuation of some of the challenges that Pat referred to around the coal business and slowing the growth around crude and continued declines in frac sand, so it just that that last eight, nine days of the month were a little bit weaker than they were through the first 80-plus days in the first quarter.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. All right. That is helpful. I appreciate that. Then just thinking maybe Mike for your or Jeff, you know the actions that you have taken in terms of sort of rightsizing the resource allocation for the network and as that plays out over the course of the years, you can sort of help us with in terms of quantifying the potential benefit of that.","Obviously, we have furloughs, we have a whole host of certain items that you have been doing as you try to sort of react to the way volumes are trending on the network. Any help that you can give us in terms of maybe what the impact would have been on the first quarter if you had made those changes at day one of the quarter or maybe what the full-year kind of benefit might be from a cost perspective would be helpful. Thank you.","Jeff Songer","This is Jeff. As Mike mentioned on the T&E side, we are currently sitting at about 5% of TE on the U.S. side furloughs, so as the graph shown and I talked about that lagged a little bit, the decline of volume in February, but in March we are sitting strong, so really the full impact of those benefits you will see going in April.","The Mexico side of the labor is different, because we are hiring and we are continuing to hire to get through some of the service issues I mentioned on the crew side down there. That has escalated overtime a bit, because your working some crews extra, so I think the balancing of all that here. We have got a lot of employees in the pipeline for Mexico, so I think we are better positioned to address those issues here going forward. In the U.S. just continued on the cost side on the management as we have outlined.","David Starling","Chris. This is Dave, I might add a little more color. We compete with that same car fleet, so as the West Coast starts to flush out East-West, that took up some of the equipment that we would have been able to use in the - so that will start to write itself fairly quickly.","Then the ice storm in Dallas, kind of caused us all of us surprise, because the carriers ran out of chassis, the truckers did, so we ended up having to ground containers and full traffic back in Atlanta, so we were really fighting for cars and chassis, so with the time that got itself worked out, we were setting on a huge number of empty containers that needed to be repositioned in New Mexico that we have been unable to do for several weeks.","That's a natural flow of trucks. It is an inbound market, so the trucks come in, they are made empty and we try to load those up and pull onto Mexico for a couple of our major customers and that just literally stopped for three or four weeks, so it takes time to get it moved down, get it in Mexico, get it out the gate, create load and come back and give an order, so we should start to see some of that catch-up happening we would think fairly quickly.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Is it fair to think that, sort of just to make sure I am sort of clear and is it fair to think that sort of where the resource allocation is today relative to the volumes that with pricing as good as it is and sort of the other factors being relatively neutral to the operating profit that you can post growth in the second quarter and beyond kind of with the resource allocation that we see right now, is that a fair assumption?","Mike Upchurch","Chris, this is Mike. I think that is a fair assumption. Let me take just a slightly different stab at your question. About half of our expenses were directly variable to the traffic, so that is crew labor, fuel, car hire expenses and while you use a car in existing train start that does not necessarily save you that that crew labor, but I think we can scale that half of our expenses fairly well. Then you have about 20% that are semi-variable around equipment costs, maintenance so forth.","As we park equipment, we will have some savings there, but that's not directly scalable. Then the other 30 are really more fixed costs while we can make some reductions there depreciation about half of that fixed costs, so there is not much w are going to be able to do there, but I think scaling properly we can regenerate earnings growth there.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene","Yes. Hi, there. Good morning. Pat, I am wondering if you can talk a little bit more on automotive side, so the 8% volumes goes pretty good. We hear all about these new plants opening up, but I do not know that have a good sense for '16 and '17, how to put that in context in terms of, does that accelerator the growth. 8%, it is actually pretty high, so I do not know how to think about how much more growth can come from automotive versus just a pretty good run rate of 8%.","Pat Ottensmeye","It is a little unclear how some of these new plants are going to ramp up, particularly the ones that have just been recently announced. We know that Audi and Kia are going to be opened in 2016, some of the other announcements that are well beyond that out all the way to 2019 in the case of the BMW, so it's unclear how.","As we have learned from the previous experience with the four new plants that have opened in last year-and-a-half, there are always issues at opening and quality holes other things that are that are totally unpredictable that will affect the rate of ramp up as those new plants open.","Certainly, the fact that there are four new plants under construction today then there were major announcements from General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Toyota. There are rumors the well-publicized in the press about Hyundai, so there is a lot of activity and that has probably give you a very satisfying answer about the magnitude and timing of the ramp up, but there are just so many new things kind of on the radar screen that it's an unknown at this point.","Bill Greene","Okay.","Pat Ottensmeye","Not out of the question that it could be up above this level, I mean just looking at the expectations for finished automotive growth in Mexico this year is 10%. I mentioned, we had 8% growth in the first quarter. I believe it could have been higher.","David Starling","We had car problems in the first quarter.","Pat Ottensmeye","Equipment problems, cycle times, the North American automotive car fleet is very heavily utilized right now, so there's no doubt that we missed opportunities, because of the equipment availability and service issues during the first quarter.","Bill Greene","Okay. Then Pat and also Dave, maybe you can comment on whether an IPO of Ferromex would affect the competitive landscape if they are not a product group of Mexico, do you think that changes anything or is this sort of a non-event you in Mexico and your market share opportunity there.","David Starling","Actually, Bill, we really have not thought about it, so I would say to us it is a non-event. We kind of operate in different parts of Mexico, there are some points where we touch each other in interchange, but fortunately for both of us, we kind of have our own market strengths and we really do not see the IPO being other than part of the strategy of the whole mining group.","Bill Greene","So, it was not that they acted sort of irrationally in the marketplace prior to the separation?","David Starling","No. I think FXE has been a pretty good competitor and a good partner. We like in the U.S., when we get in trouble, we try to help each other. We certainly worked hand-in-hand with FXE one on the Mexican rail reregulation, so we have a good relationship with FXE and we do not expect them to do anything different because of the IPO.","Bill Greene","Okay. All right. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Troy from Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Troy","Great. Thanks, everybody. I just want to ask about the longer-term operating ratio goal below 60, so I think by 2017, some Eastern rails of thrown out longer-term OR targets and they have proven illusive given headwinds and coal. I know you have much more concentrated and smaller business in coal, but certainly a problematic customer, so it seems every 6 to 12 months.","I was wondering can you contemplate hitting that low 60s OR target if this customer ceases to be a customer in the next two to three years. I mean, what kind of coal outlook does that margin expectation incorporate? I am just trying to figure out how attainable it is if coal remains in the doldrums.","David Starling","I do not think over the last couple of years, we have had very high expectations for coal, so most of the growth that we are working on is still around automotive, intermodal and crude. We think energy still has a lot of room and I think we were all kind of surprised by the price of oil and what it did, the effect it had on drilling and also the movement of crude by rail, so I think that would be the bigger factor, it would be more on the crude side, but I do not see coal. Fortunately, we have been kind of unwinding ourselves and being cold for some time.","Matt Troy","Plans of being and good thing over time, thank you for that color. The second follow-up would be simply, you mentioned before that on the crude by rail side that a lot of these major destinations were ready and you are capable of moving hell of a lot more crude. I just want to reconcile that with your comments on the reduced CapEx guidance. You said it was specific to some areas where growth may be deferred and you wanted to unwind the investment with kind of when the opportunities will emerge.","If the crude destinations are ready, could you just help maybe put some level of specific in terms of what you are deferring on the CapEx side? What end markets commodities that might relate to and when that CapEx might come back? Thank you.","Jeff Songer","Yes. This is Jeff. I will address that. The deferrals in the CapEx as I mentioned, we are continuing to move forward on design and permit, so we will have those as I mentioned shovel-ready, primarily those who are in the Kansas City interchange, but the decrease in the coal volume as [indiscernible] capacity to begin with.","As the crude, we look towards primary the Kansas City interchange. You have already got some capacity developed, but as I mentioned the projects we have done over the past three to four years with capacity and infrastructure to support those crude oil routes, I think is certainly sufficient and we are in pretty good position for that. As we get the indication of the volume increasing, those projects we will be ready in the Kansas City interchange primarily to execute quickly.","David Starling","I think the other thing I would touch on is, we have always run very lean and we have never really had a surge fleet, so for the first time this year, by the time we take all the deliveries of the locomotives that are due in 2015, we are going to have a surge fleet of maybe 50 to 100 locomotives. There will be older, less efficient, less fuel-efficient locomotives, but there is nothing wrong with them and we were running them every day, so we will have the capability when the crude comes. We got the power, we got the track structure, but as Jeff said there will be a few tweaks in Kansas City that will help us handle it, but they certainly do not prevent us from handling it today.","Matt Troy","Understood. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I have a couple for Pat first, so at the current run rate, what percent of coal in total volume is this one customer now.","Then I know there were some talk last quarter about potential risk with pricing in Mexico given the pace, so and has to do some changes there. Any update there on any changes you guys have felt compelled to do on the pricing side?","Pat Ottensmeye","I will take the last one first. No. No changes compelled on the pricing side. We are still seeing a solid pricing environment on both sides of the border, 4.2% for the quarter was up from fourth quarter and we have got things in the pipeline, new pricing on contracts that are going to be expiring or renewed in the next few months even above those level, so capacity is tied everywhere as you know and the pricing environment looks very good for us both, in the U.S. and Mexico.","Regarding the first question, at current run rates our exposure to this one particular customer is very low. I mean, not to be flipping about it, but it more than accounted this one customer, more than accounted for our total of 26% reduction in utility coal during the quarter.","As we look out over the course of the year, the first quarter is certainly - second quarter, we do not expect to be stronger, maybe a little bit weaker. Then depending on heat in Texas and how much coal is required to keep the stockpiles and the plants burning.","We could see some strength in the third and fourth quarter, but right now based on our overall view for the full-year for utility coal, it is going to be kind of in line with what we saw in the first quarter.","Scott, do not hold me to these exact numbers, but they were roughly a third of our business a year ago in coal and they were about 2% of our business this quarter.","Scott Group","Okay. That is very helpful.","Jeff Songer","Okay.","Scott Group","Then for I guess either Mike or Dave, do you have any view on when CapEx could come down closer to that 20% of revenue range. Given what we have seen in the stock, do you feeling like you are any closer to wanting to have a share buyback?","David Starling","Let's see, now that four questions. This is will be it, Scott. You can't have another one. On the CapEx, we have been at a very high rate because of the growth. A lot of the things that we have done have positioned us with the crude, has positioned with the locomotives and the access to the facilities in the south, so we are going to be taking a real strong look at the CapEx next year and I do expect it to come down. I am not going to give you the percentage, but I do expect it to come down.","We also run our network in good shape and that is something that was very important to us it has been reflected in our lower development costs and more efficiency in a lot of parts of in the railroad.","The stock buyback, we are certainly not opposed to that. We are going to really take a look at this year to see what is going to happen in the back half of the year.","We believe that this crude will write itself at some point and that as we have read in your article with the price going up the way it has gone that there should start to be some kind of movement in the crude, which we think we are well-positioned for.","As cash flow improves and the capital comes down, it is certainly something we are going to be looking at.","Scott Group","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Justin Long from Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning.","David Starling","Hi, Justin.","Justin Long","Hi. Thinking about your revise 2015 guidance, I was just wondering if you could talk in a little bit more detail about the assumptions you made in the energy market. There has been some discussion of this, but you gave guidance for the entire segment to post revenue up single-digit, but could you talk about your revenue expectations if we were to break that out between coal, crude and frac sand in this for the full-year?","Jeff Songer","Well, I think I have already covered coal just in terms of the outlook for the year. Frac sand, we continue to feel that is going to be weak at current prices. Then, obviously crude oil, we are still expecting growth based on the facilities that have open. Dave mentioned the one facility that we just connected to in March, the Edmonton terminal that is going to be open in May, so we still see growth.","We have kind of moderated our expectations for crude oil since the January outlook, but still see growth there. As I stated, I think Dave has stated a couple of times, there is a lot of uncertainty there, price of oil, whether we have ramp up difficulties of some of these new terminals that open, so our crystal ball is not very clear when it comes to that particular market, but our expectations are that we will see growth over the course of the year. Two of the businesses still showing declines, although coal may get stronger in the summer and the fall, but crude oil, we are still showing growth.","One thing I will just kind of mention and remind, unlike some of the other railroads, our crude oil businesses is so small today and driven by development and completion of these destination terminals in the Gulf that are fairly recent. We do not originate any crude oil, we get it all at interchange with the primarily the Canadian railroads, so our story is a little bit different, because we are so small and the destination terminals that we are serving are very new.","Justin Long","Okay. To just sum it up, I guess, do you believe that the increase in crude traffic can offset the declines you expect in coal and frac sand. Is that correct?","Jeff Songer","At this point, yes.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. Then as my second question, you took down the full-year revenue expectation and intermodal, it sounds like that is mainly a congestion and equipment issue, but have you seen any slowdown in the underlying intermodal demand environment in the last few months, particularly given lower fuel prices. I am just curious if it would be a mid-single digit volume growth environment today in intermodal if we are operating in a fluid network?","Jeff Songer","No. I think we would see intermodal growth in the double-digit range if we were operating in a fluid network. The market is there, there is no doubt about it. We are not seeing declining fuel prices. We do not feel has had a major - provided a headwind to the overall truck to rail conversion thesis. I think, the experience we saw in the first quarter is all related to equipment availability and network congestion.","David Starling","I think just in the congestion issues on the West Coast ports are hurting us in the short-term, but there are going to be a benefit to us from a long-term, because people wanting to convert some of their traffic international carriers, we think L\u00e1zaro for the Texas area.","Jeff Songer","Yes. Just look at the L\u00e1zaro growth for the first quarter. As I mentioned in my comments, we do expect that it will decline from the first quarter rates, but still see very solid growth at Lazaro this year. Driven to some degree by the recent automotive announcements, we are looking at the moving a significant number of inbound containers for materials for one of the plants that is under construction. Then as those plants get built, we will see an increase in import activity of the parts and other components.","Justin Long","Great. That is all helpful color. I appreciate the time today.","David Starling","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Hi. Good afternoon. Long one, so I will be quick relatively. If we step back a little bit, you used to be maybe easily double the growth rate of the Class I peers and I think that is why you got such a strong valuation when you look at the stock. Is there something structural going on here in terms of your growth rate, how you think about that?","Another question before earlier on the call was on your earnings outlook. I know extended to 2016, but when you think about your growth rate, are we looking at, hey this is one year right now or down 80% or 90% on coal from a customer, so that is what bring you to these flat single digits or are we more aligned now because of we have gone through this massive growth phase and we should think about being more aligned with kind of growth of the rail industry. Maybe you could just step back and once we get past maybe the coal and an issue right now, how do you think about the growth back for the company?","Mike Upchurch","Still very positive, Ken, I think obviously coal. I guess one way that I would kind of characterize it as, due to the dramatic reduction in oil and gas prices, we have seen sort of a very prominent negative impact on some of our businesses at the front end. Still believe that longer-term low energy costs should be a positive for the economy, but that is going to play out over a much longer period of time and sort of much more gradually and that is sort of the macro comment.","If you look at the opportunities that we have talked about in the past, automotive growth, four new plants, three recent announcements for expansions over the road to rail conversion for cross-border truck, ethane, ethylene plants Dave mentioned that\u2019s all plant where they at the groundbreaking last month those plants are still being built.","Mexican Energy Reform, good questions about how the price of oil is going to impact the interest in activity there. We do not know the answer to that, but still feel that that is going to be a long-term positive. All of those things are still very much intact.","Ken Hoexter","Pat, if could just jump in real quick there. I just want to understand are those things all like '17, '18, '19 or are they more kind of what can help you out in the '16, '17 like more on the closer end to get back growth?","Pat Ottensmeye","I would say they are longer term.","Ken Hoexter","Yes.","Pat Ottensmeye","The thing that could really help us out this year, I think is obviously a real hot summer in Texas and get the coals moving a little bit more frequently.","Then on the automotive and intermodal side, certainly equipment, capacity, service those things were noticeable headwinds in the first quarter.","We think as Jeff mentioned, we are well on our way to solving some of those issues and should see some pickup there. Then in ag, we definitely had some impact. In the back half of the year, we had a huge harvest last year as you remember.","We had some negative impact due to cycle times being extended and equipment availability that maybe look at it is the bright side the silver lining in the coal cloud may be that we have more network capacity this year to handle more grain.","There is no doubt and I think we talked about this in the third and fourth quarter that we missed opportunities in the grain business last year because of the cycle times and capacity and congestions.","Those are the, I would say the near-term things that we believe will take us from where we are in the first quarter to the full year guidance that we are giving.","Ken Hoexter","Okay. I appreciate that and my follow-up was on the grain, which you kind of answer there, so I also appreciate the time.","Jeff Songer","Okay. we are going long here, so I am going to ask folks to try to hold the question down to one and we are going to take three more and we are going to cut it off, because we have already gone about an hour to 15 minutes, so we appreciate all the interest, but we are going to take three more here, so go ahead please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from John Barnes from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes","Thanks guys for taking the question. Hey, just real quick on the CapEx going back to this. I recognized that the year-end environment, where you are trying to right size the spending with the volume levels. However, your story has always been about some of the volumes kind of only come whether its automotive side, the oil side.","How do you kind of balance the two pulling back in certain areas, but making sure you don't get behind in case the run rate of auto production in Mexico begins to surge faster than you anticipated or with the rebound and all you begin to just see more oil equipments. How do you balance those two?","Jeff Songer","Yes. This is Jeff. I will address that. I specifically call that our two largest projects were which are growth related, this Wiley intermodal terminal. That has been a $50 million investment couple of years in the making and that will open in July and continue to support the growth in that segment.","I can't underscore the probably important of the Sanchez project as well and that is a multi, multi-multimillion dollar project that unfortunately it took us two years to secure the permits and all the environmental permits for that, but we have broken around down and Sanchez. There is cross-border fluidity intermodal automotive everything driving in Mexico to from the states really, really moves to those facility down there and handling that volume now and on Laredo yard, which we kind of simply outgrown your landlocked. That is again shorter inefficient tracks the Sanchez continuation of the build out of the Sanchez facilities is going to support that.","David Starling","Just to finish up, we have ordered a lot of cars. We got grain cars coming, we have got automotive cars coming and we have got 50 locomotives this year.","We were concerned that locomotives would not be available next year, we are the smallest players, and we have to be careful. We can't run out of power, so we do not foresee needing any locomotives for next year as well, so that could be a big part of our reduction in the capital budget.","John Barnes","Okay. Thanks for your time guys.","David Starling","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Hi. Great. Thank you. I just wondered Mike if you could add a little more perspective on the headcount trend. I know you comment a little bit on kind of why U.S. down, Mexico up, but overall how might we think of that and how quickly you can really get some of the cost control and cost reduction that would support your margins? Thank you.","Mike Upchurch","Well, Tom I think specifically on the furloughed comment, we are down about 80 in transportation and maybe I will have Jeff talk specifically about where we are headed with that number, but it is obviously going to be dependent on what happens with Carloads, with crude mainly and coal?","Jeff Songer","Yes. Similar to the balancing the expenses with maintaining the growth, it is a little different story on the segments we operate, so the targeted teeny reductions, the 5% basically geared toward to coal and energy [indiscernible] and I mentioned in Mexico, you actually supporting with additional headcount to overcoming your services issues and to maintain the growth, so headcount for me is something we are seeing immediate benefits in targeted areas, but we are continuing to support to grow segments through hiring.","Tom Wadewitz","Is that enough to give you potential for margin improvement given the stock revenues or not necessarily?","Mike Upchurch","I believe, so yes.","David Starling","We think it should. If you think about the time when this perspective, the crews that we are adding in Mexico are to handle more automotive and more intermodal so you are going to have direct benefit there by improved revenue and we are running a higher attrition rate in Mexico than we expected and it does take a longer to on board a crew in Mexico once we made the decision, so we have got to get a little more nimble and be able to get ahead of that a little quicker.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Thanks for your time. I appreciate.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jason Seidl from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you gentlemen and thanks for letting me back clean up here. The one question I have is really just on the pricing side. If you look at sort of your truck competitive business versus your non-truck competitive businesses, is there a vast difference in the pricing power that you have right now in the marketplace?","Jeff Songer","There is a difference. I would say that for intermodal, we are still focused on building density, filling trains, adding, growing the business, so we are a little more focused on the growth than the necessarily pricing, which does not mean that we are not seeing price increases, but on the business it is not truck competitive, capacity is very tight and I would say that the rate increases we are seeing on that type of business are generally higher.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Thank you for the color guys.","David Starling","Thanks.","Jeff Songer","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I would like turn the call back over to Mr. Starling for closing comments.","David Starling","Okay. Thanks for everyone's patients. I know it was a long call, a lot of questions. We appreciate everyone's interest in the company and we will see you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"12344":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q1 2014 Earnings Conference Call April 16, 2014  4:30 PM ET","Executives","David Starling - President and Chief Executive Officer","Dave Ebbrecht - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Pat Ottensmeyer - Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing","Mike Upchurch - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya - Executive Representative and President, KCSM","Analysts","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Justin Long - Stephens","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the Kansas City Southern First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, filed with the SEC. The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David Starling","Thank you and welcome to Kansas City Southern's first quarter call. We know it's late in the day and a busy time before the Easter holiday, so we intend to be very efficient today. Today's presenters here with me today is Dave Ebbrecht, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Pat Ottensmeyer, Executive VP, Sales and Marketing; Mike Upchurch, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. And on the call will be Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, our Executive Representative and President, KCSM.","Turning to the first slide, our record first quarter consolidated revenue of $607 million were up 10% over the prior year. Ag and Min clearly led the way, growing 40% over 2013. Our grain revenues were up 69%, which much of that being long-haul traffic from the Midwest to Mexico. As we noted on the fourth quarter call, KCS is enjoying the dual benefits of strong grain carloadings and easy comps due to the 2012 [drought] [ph]. We expect the grain business to continue to show very good year-over-year growth throughout the second quarter. But during the second half of 2014, the growth trajectory in grain will plateau as we hit some tough comps in the fall.","I should also mention that coal volumes were better than expected due to the higher natural gas prices, which allowed one of our coal customers to take more coal than they had previously planned. We expect coal volumes to remain solid in the second quarter, but it's a little too early for us to reject any certainty of what will happen in the third and fourth quarters. Clearly natural gas prices will be one element in what happens later in the year.","A combination of our strong revenues, good mix and efficient operations were the primary drivers in KCS reporting an adjusted operating ratio of 68.7% in the first quarter. After excluding the impact of our lease termination cost, the operating ratio improved by 1.8 points over the first quarter 2013.","On the next page, an update for first quarter 2014 and comparing our performance with our annual guidance, we were either in line or in some cases a little better than we had been in January or laid out in January. Volume for the quarter was up 4%, which was within the mid-single-digit guidance we provided. I think we should be encouraged by the fact that a great deal of the 4% growth came in the last month of the quarter, and that positive momentum has carried into April.","First quarter revenue growth was 10%. Our year-over-year revenue growth benefited from easy comps in our grain business due to the draught, which impacted us throughout the first half of 2013. I mentioned KCS is 1.8 operating ratio improvement over the first quarter 2013, which puts us fully in line with our full year guidance. And finally, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth came in 18% higher than the prior year, which again positions us well for the mid-teens earning growth we projected for 2014.","I'll come back in a few minutes to provide some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions, but right now I'll turn the program over to Dave Ebbrecht to discuss first quarter operations performance.","Dave Ebbrecht","Okay. Thanks, Dave. Let's turn to Slide 8. As you can see, we continue to grow our volumes and our headcount controls are remaining solid; we increased 4% carloads during the quarter and only had an increase of 1.8% in headcount, while continuing to scale below the growth. And as we hit [stair step] [ph] growth milestones, we will see our efficiencies take dips from time to time in the chart provided, but the overall trend will continue to remain positive.","On Slide 9, you can see our velocity was at 27.5 miles per hour for the quarter. This was 0.3 degradation sequentially over the fourth quarter, and dwell was better than last quarter by 2.5 hours at 19.4 hours. This was largely due to the higher amounts of grain and coal [inaudible] that traditionally carried or carried lower train speeds than intermodal or the automotive trains. The mix differential created the lower overall average train speeds.","Weather did not play much of an expense role on operations compared to same periods in previous year and connectivity with our interchange carriers was relatively fluid, although it is worthy to mention that our rolling stock availability was extremely tight throughout the quarter due to congestion in Chicago and in the Northeast.","That's all I have. I'll turn it over to Pat.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 11. As Dave Starling reported earlier, revenues for the first quarter were $607.4 million, 10% higher than last year and a record for the first quarter. Volumes increased by 4% to 535,000 carloads. Adverse foreign exchange, foreign currency moves had the impact of reducing revenues by about 1%. So absent FX impact, we would have reported revenue increase of 11%.","Turning to the business unit details, as you can see on this slide, revenues and RPU increased in all of our major business units, but volumes were a bit more of a mixed story, although as we drill into the details, we do not believe that we're seeing a downturn in any of our major business units. And as you'll see later, we are not changing our full year growth outlook.","The short story for the quarter, as Dave mentioned, is that grain and utility coal were both strong and were both negatively impacted by weather, not so much on the KCS network itself, but on the North American rail network more generally. The primary negative areas for the quarter were crude oil, which we expect to turn positive over the remainder of the year, scrap paper, which I'll talk about more in a moment, and agrichemicals, due primarily to difficult comp last year.","Now just a little bit more on each of the business units. In our Chemical & Petroleum business, revenues increased by 3% on a 3% reduction in volumes. RPU showed a strong increase of 6%, driven primarily by mix, specifically higher petroleum shipments in Mexico. As we look at the major contributors to the volume decline, there were three main factors that I would consider temporary or event driven such as planned outages, supply disruptions, et cetera, and one significant factor that was more permanent in nature. I talked about this more permanent reduction last quarter, but as a reminder, there was lower fuel oil shipment to a utility customer in Mexico because of their decision to shift power generation away from fuel oil to natural gas and hydroelectric.","The larger factor contributing to the volume reduction was due to the temporary factors that I mentioned, and those have largely been reversed or resolved in the second quarter. Through yesterday, our second quarter volumes in this business unit were up about 5% from last year.","Industrial & Consumer revenues were 3% higher on a 2% reduction in volumes versus last year. The largest contributor to the volume decline was lower shipments of newly manufactured railcars out of Mexico. Perhaps a more interesting factor was a 12% decline in scrap paper. I talked about this a little last quarter and said that we're watching this group closely as it feels like core demand may be slipping a bit. But what we have heard from some of our larger customers is, is that there was some load shifting in the first quarter as trucks were more nimble to recover from weather-related disruptions than rail. The general view is that this business will be flat for the full year, so we should see some improvements over the remaining three quarters. We're seeing that so far in April, albeit only 15 days, but volumes and revenues are both up by about 10% from last year.","Our Ag & Minerals revenues were up 40% on a 27% increase in carloads. Revenue per unit was 11% higher, reflecting an increase in length of haul with our cross-border grain business continue to recover from the draught impact last year. Grain volumes increased by 43% and the revenues by 69% versus last year. As with the last quarter, the term easy comp is the headline here and that will continue to be the case through the second quarter. We are expecting the second half of the year to be flat and possibly a little weaker than 2013.","Our Energy business was essentially flat to last year. The utility coal, which is still the largest commodity in the business representing more than 60% of the volumes and revenues was up slightly as one of our utility customers reopened a generating unit in Texas that was closed due to competition from natural gas. And we expect that to continue into the third quarter. Our frac sand business continued to show superior growth rates with revenues and volumes increasing by 19% and 21% respectively.","Crude oil revenues fell by 48% on a 35% decline in volumes. What we're seeing here is a dramatic and rapid shift away from light crude, driven by the availability of new pipeline capacity for Bakken crude to the US Gulf and a much slower ramp-up of heavy Canadian crude deliveries as terminals on our network add heating and seaming capabilities to handle that product. The impact of this was most pronounced in the first quarter, but this will continue to be a headwind in the second quarter as well. Based on our current best estimates, this situation will reverse in the third quarter as new origin points open or add seaming equipment and we're expecting our crude oil business to show some modest growth versus last year.","Intermodal and Automotive both continued to grow, but at lower rates than you had seen in previous quarters. As I mentioned earlier, while we cannot quantify the exact impact, we do believe that the severe winter weather in North America had a negative impact on both of these businesses as equipment supply was constrained and some modal shifting was done by our customers. Again, that belief would be validated by recent trends as both volume and revenue growth in April are higher than what we thought in the first quarter.","Moving to Slide 12, our cross-border revenue fell from the record level in the fourth quarter, but increased by 18% from the first quarter 2013. Again, the headline here is cross-border trains, but we saw a 72% increase in revenues, driven by a 58% increase in volumes versus last year. Cross-border intermodal increased by 38% versus last year. With the exception of automotive, which was impacted by equipment supply constraints, cross-border revenues in all other business units were flat or higher during the quarter.","Looking at the strategic growth areas on Slide 13, we saw the lowest combined growth rates in these five key business units since we started businesses since we first started to show you this data in the fourth quarter of 2012. As you can see on the chart, the overall pace of growth of growth in these businesses was dragged down by crude oil, which I discussed earlier. Revenues were actually lower than last year. Growth rates for L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas Intermodal and Automotive were also lower than we had seen in previous quarters. Looking ahead, we will see the pace of these five key business units return to double-digit range. And for the full year, we would expect revenue growth for these businesses to be in the high teens.","Turning to the market outlook on Slide 14, as you can see, there is no change from what we reported to you in January. Our current best estimates for total freight revenues are unchanged in all of the six major business units. And as Dave Starling mentioned earlier, we are currently expecting revenue growth for the company as a whole to be in the high-single-digit range for the full year. With the exception of Ag & Minerals and Automotive, our first quarter performance is pretty much in line with the full year guidance.","I'll touch briefly on a couple of maybe more obvious questions. Our full year guidance, as I mentioned earlier, continues to be high single-digits for revenue growth and we just produced 10% in the first quarter, which in the rail industry tends to be one of the slower quarters. I will tell you that we were almost exactly on our internal plan for the first quarter, so that was factored into our guidance we gave you in January and we are reiterating now.","As I mentioned earlier, the grain business will continue to provide strong comps through the second quarter, but will flatten out in the third quarter and could actually decline a bit in the fourth quarter. If you remember, the fourth quarter of 2013 was extremely strong. Our forecast is also based on assumptions about the weather and the 2014 crop, which of course are complete unknowns at this time. Our current forecast for utility coal is a little stronger than it was January based on the sooner than anticipated return of Luminant business. But when you factor that into all of the other pieces of our Energy business units, we still feel that we will end up in the high-single-digit growth rates for the full year here.","Crude oil will continue to be a headwind into the second quarter, but we expect it to turn positive in the second half and we are currently expecting it to be modestly positive overall for the year. Also keep in mind the crude oil revenues are less than 1% of our consolidated total revenues.","Finally, Automotive and Intermodal would continue to be growth leaders. Automotive growth in the first quarter was at 7%, but we're still comfortable with our full year double-digit growth forecast as equipment supply issues have largely been resolved and our three new auto plants in Mexico will ramp up production over the remainder of the year. So far in April, our Automotive revenues and volumes have increased above first quarter growth rates.","Moving on to the next slide, some of you may have seen this at investor conferences recently, we introduced it in February. What we're trying to illustrate with this slide is the time periods during which we are projecting superior revenue growth rates, i.e., double-digit for each of our key long-term growth areas. Since this slide focuses on long-term growth opportunities, we have added Mexican energy reform and ethylene plants, neither of which are currently expected to produce significant levels of revenue or volume until 2017. I'll make just a few clarifying comments here.","For Automotive, this illustration is based only on the plants that are built, under construction or have been announced. It is quite possible that this superior growth period could be extended if more new plants are built in Mexico. We believe there will be more plants announced possibly as soon as this year. For our frac sand business on this slide, this view is based on US shipment only and not potential shipments in the Mexico as a result of those energy reforms. The reason we feel that our frac sand growth period will end in 2018 is that our network in Texas is more limited than some of the other railroads. And at some point, we believe that we will have a wholly developed network of receiving terminals. And at that point, we would expect that our revenue growth rates would start to flatten out.","For crude oil, this view is based on projects that we're currently working on, including new terminals in Port Arthur and Baton Rouge. I'll make just a quick comment about the Port Arthur project. We continue to make good progress on our crude terminal project in Port Arthur. Negotiations with our partner are proceeding as planned, but we're still not yet in a position to make an announcement or provide additional details at this time.","And finally for L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, again this reflects only the intermodal container growth at L\u00e1zaro, we do not expect to see a return to consistent sustainable double-digit revenue growth until the new ATM terminal facility is opened in the second half of next year.","Finally, I'll wrap up my comments on Slide 16, which summarizes some of the key factors and assumptions on which our guidance is based. I've already touched on most of these, so I'll close by saying that our outlook for the economy in both the US and Mexico is positive. We basically hit our revenue plan for the first quarter and our outlook for the full year is unchanged from 90 days ago. And we continue to feel very good about the strength of our new business pipeline and our long-term growth prospects.","With that, I'll turn the presentation over to Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Pat, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start on Slide 18. As Pat previously indicated, revenues were up a solid 10%, a 4% increase in carloads and a 6% increase in revenue per carload. FX did negatively impact revenues by approximately 1% on the growth rate, but operating expense was positively impacted by FX, resulting in an immaterial impact to operating income and the operating ratio.","The adjusted operating ratio for the quarter was 68.7%, a 180 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2013. The difference between our reported and adjusted operating ratio is due to a $29.9 million charge relating to the purchase of approximately $130 million of equipment that was under lease and the related lease termination. Those costs represent a one-time early extinguishment to make the lessor whole on the lease. And I'll provide further details in a few minutes, but these transactions benefit not only ongoing operating income and OR, but being able to finance the purchase of this equipment at historically low interest rates, particularly after achievement of our investment grade rating a year ago, creates substantial positive net present value.","Despite our fourth quarter 2013 financing to acquire some of this equipment, interest expense actually declined 21% year-over-year due to the refinancing activity we completed almost a year ago and the launch of a commercial paper program early this year. Our average effective interest rate of 3.5% is more than 2 points lower than the first quarter of 2013, and we believe we continue to have the lowest effective interest rate in the rail industry. Assuming no further financing activity during the year, we would expect interest expense to be approximately $75 million for the full year.","First quarter 2014 adjusted EPS increased 18% to $1.05. An increased adjusting operating income contributed to 17% of that increase, interest expense another $0.03 and higher tax rate reduced our EPS by $0.03. Finally, we've included more income statement details, including effective tax rates and foreign exchange impact in the appendix.","Moving to Slide 19, our first quarter 2014 reported EPS was $0.85, but $1.05 on an adjusted basis. And we've provided some details as to the reconciling items. You can see the lease termination costs were $0.18 in the quarter, debt retirement cost $0.04, and those were offset by a $0.02 gain on foreign exchange.","On Slide 20, our consolidated operating expenses excluding the lease termination cost increased 7% year-over-year (inaudible) the 10% revenue increase and did allow us to achieve a strong 48% incremental margin during the quarter. Key drivers of our expense decrease are outlined in the table to the right, but were predominantly due to fuel cost, volume and wage rate increases, depreciation from higher capital spend and casualty expense. Foreign exchange lowered expenses by $5 million. And we saw a $3 million net reduction in operating expense as a result of our lease conversion program. And I'll provide more details on specific line items starting with compensation on Slide 21.","As you can see on the bar chart, average employee headcount increased 1.8% and is largely reflective of step functions in our operations group to support increased volumes. As Dave Ebbrecht indicated earlier, we will continue to carefully manage our demand and be responsive to the higher needs to maintain an efficient railroad and at a rate of increase that will be below our volume increases.","Compensation cost increased due to wage inflation of about 3.5% and the resulting increase in headcount. Those increases were offset by lower incentive on a year-over-year basis and some modest benefit that we receive from foreign exchange.","Moving to Slide 22, fuel expense increased $30 million or 14%. Consumption increases were due to a 4% increase in carloads and a 13% increase in overall train gross ton miles, which is largely a result of mixed shift in grain and coal. Price per gallon also increased on a year-over-year basis from $3.02 a gallon to $3.10 a gallon in 2014, and that contributed about $5 million to the overall fuel expense increase. FX and efficiency both contributed about $2 million to lower our fuel expense. And finally, due to the rising prices predominantly in Mexico, our net lag impact was unfavorable for approximately $3 million.","On Slide 23, we've included equipment and depreciation expense details on the same slide to be able to show you the net benefit we received during the quarter of the lease conversion program. As you can see, equipment expense declined $10 million to $32 million into the quarter. $7 million of this decline was due to the elimination of equipment expense from purchasing assets under lease. The other $3 million in equipment expense declined as a result of lower net car hire expenses, which is reflective of owning additional equipment. On the bottom of the chart, depreciation expense increased $9 million, $5 million of that from a larger capital base as a result of (inaudible) capital expense and $4 million from lease conversions. And you can see the net benefit of lease reduction and the increase in depreciation was $3 million for the quarter.","On Slide 24, materials and other increased $9 million in the quarter, largely due to increased casualty expenses. Approximately half of that increase was a result of larger one-time credits in the first quarter of 2013 and the remaining increase is due to larger dollar values from derailments in the first quarter, although the level of accidents is down on a year-over-year basis.","And to conclude my remarks, I will move to Slide 25. Our first priority, as you know, is managing our free cash flow and capital structure to continue to invest in the growth opportunities we believe we have in this business. Accordingly we established a budget early in 2014 to spend 22% of our revenue on capital. But based on our current view of growth opportunities, particularly in 2015 coupled with a projected substantial price increase for new Tier 4 locomotives, we are currently increasing our capital spend to 28% of revenue by ordering additional locomotives for delivery by the end of the year.","We've also made a change in our priorities to elevate the strategy that provides returns to our shareholders with our excess cash flow; whereas in prior years, we still had substantial debt restructuring opportunities. As you know, in January, we did increase the dividend by 30% to an annualized level of $1.12 per share, approximately $125 million of cash flow that's used for dividend. So while we believe we continue to have lease conversion opportunities, we have made substantial progress to date increasing our mix of leased equipment since 2011 from the low 20% range to 44%, and we're close to completing a few more transactions that would allow us to move closer to 50% owned equipment by the end of the year.","And finally, during the quarter, we also redeemed the remaining $63 million of our 8% KCSM notes. And with that, I'll conclude my comments and turn the call back to Dave.","Dave Starling","Thanks, Mike. I'd like to end by again emphasizing that not only did we have a good first quarter, but we're optimistic that we can continue on this positive track throughout the course of 2014. And I hope this afternoon that we've dispelled any impression we might have left with you in January regarding KCS' long-term growth prospects. We at KCS are as enthusiastic as we've ever been in our growth story. While for a variety of reasons, some of our near-term growth opportunities are ramping up a little later than we had originally anticipated, they are ramping up and over the longer term, they will be substantial.","And finally, as illustrated in the chart Pat discussed, we now see our business growth curve extending out further than we had projected a few years ago. The management team is very excited about the company's future and remains dedicated to turning the majority of our opportunities into tangible realities. And with that, we will be happy to entertain your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","I wanted to ask about the first quarter performance relative to the expectations that you outlined in January. And as I think about the 18% earnings growth in Q1 what you did mention as typically the weakest quarter during the year, that relative to the mid-teens earnings guidance for '14, so should we expect the balance of the year to decelerate in terms of earnings growth or do you think that there is a potential for some upside but maybe you're erring on the side of conservatism at this point?","Mike Upchurch","One thing to keep in mind is we did have about $0.03 benefit in the quarter from interest expense. And given the guidance that I provided of $75 million for the year, you won't see that in the remaining quarters. So there won't be any year-over-year benefit. I think consistent with what we talked about in January that was a big driver of our earnings growth over the last couple of years. So when you pull that out, mid-teens looks pretty solid to us.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","And then as a follow-up question, it looks like there was a meaningful step-down in cross-border intermodal volume and revenue growth. And I realize that comps are difficult. The base is bigger, but is the 35%-ish growth range a good run rate to use going forward, or do you expect a reacceleration as you add some new services, specifically the ones that you mentioned during the fourth quarter call?","Pat Ottensmeyer","We can't feel too bad about 35% growth anywhere. But as we have said consistently that as the base gets bigger, these growth rates, we would expect them to moderate a little bit. But having said that, we definitely feel that the growth in the first quarter was affected by the weather and just the congestion and availability of cars and containers and everything else throughout North America. We can't quantify that, but that's what we're hearing from some of our large customers. So we're expecting for the rest of the year that the growth rates will move higher in cross-border intermodal. But over a longer period of time, we should expect them to come down as the base gets bigger.","David Starling","We compete for the assets with our partners anyway, even in normal times. But when they get - the number of containers they did that are basically stuck in some of those weather-impacted areas and it is more difficult for them to prioritize to Mexico. So we were told by our partners that it definitely had an effect on the container supply for Mexico.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","What do you think about the second quarter specifically? Obviously, you're on to a really good start from a volume standpoint. How much do you think you'll sort of catch up and maybe how does that sort of progress as you go forward through the quarter here? And usually you're at a very nice run rate and would imply your revenues sort of run rate well above 10%, but just want to get a rough sense of how should we think about sort of the cadence within the second quarter.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yeah, you're right, we feel like there was some sort of pent up momentum moving into the second quarter. Volumes are very strong. We're coming up on Easter week. That's always a bigger deal for us because of extended holiday in Mexico. So when we get through April, we'll have a better sense as to how much of this might have been a short-term blip versus a more sustainable. However we know that the grain comps are going to be strong and the coal comps, because of Luminant coming back early, should be strong as well. So I think wouldn't be surprised to see pretty good performance on the top line for second quarter, but then the third quarter is going to get tougher because of the comps and the fall off of the coal in the fourth quarter could be tougher yet.","David Starling","The only thing we know for sure about Luminant that whatever number they've given us in the past, it's always, well, have to be careful. It's variable.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","And then when you think about auto plants, Pat, now that we're moving into a little bit later on in 2014, how do you think about sort of the pace of that ramp-up. I know I think in the slide, you said over the next couple of years it will continue to ramp. Is it sort of progressing as you had expected? When you get into the summer months, should we be seeing sort of a little bit more of a progressive pace of outputs from those new plant online in Mexico?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yes, I think based on what we're hearing, again automotive, the second quarter comps could be very strong, because we had an extended outage at a General Motors plant last year with a new model and a quality hold. So I think you could see our automotive growth actually get stronger as we move into the year based on production schedules. Obviously that all depends on the level of automotive sales in North America. Longer-term, so over the course of 2014, we could actually see the pace of growth kind of step up quarter-to-quarter between now and the end of the year. That's why we think we're going to get back to a double-digit for the full year. And there is really no change in the outlook for the three-year ramp-up that we talked about in January. This year, the new plants, we're expecting vehicle production of about 300,000. In 2015, that will ramp up to about 550,000. And in 2016, the final ramp will take us to about 660,000. That's unchanged since January.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Okay. So progressing as expected at this point?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Can we start a little bit just on the Mexican business? I know there's still the debate on the legislation. So we'll see where that goes. But maybe you can offer us some commentary about the average length per contract in Mexico and maybe how much of productivity opportunity you still have left regardless of what happens down there. Maybe there are other levers you can pull to kind of keep improving and we'll see what the legislation looks like when it finally goes.","Pat Ottensmeyer","The average length of contract is shorter in Mexico than we typically see in the US. Much more of our business is priced annually in Mexico. Probably more than 70% of our business is priced annually. We are finding that customers are more willing to enter into longer-term contracts and spread. The other thing that causes us some administrative difficulties is very large percentage of our business in Mexico is priced in the first few months of the year. We're trying to kind of spread that out over the course of the year and we're trying to with some of our larger customers get into longer-term contracts and I think we've had some success there. But generally shorter, the vast majority are on annual contracts.","Dave Ebbrecht","And on the operating side, we still have latent capacity to grow not only on [inaudible] side, but also on the train length and capacity side. As we have different growth in the automotive and intermodal sectors that will allow us to build solid trains and that will create the ability to also run faster with the unified mix of equipment. And then we'll push into growing the larger segments that manifest. But we see a dynamic stair-step environment over the next two, three years and plenty of opportunity to grow within our current footprint.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Can I just ask one detailed question to you, Mike, and that is the locomotive, the lease termination, is this the new base of which we kind of grow this, but just step down again as you maybe do more with the locomotives going forward? Can you just remind us exactly the kind of the timing and how this should work going forward?","Mike Upchurch","Yeah, sure. We believe we still have other opportunities. We're currently working on some additional leases to purchase that equipment. There's no guarantee that we'll complete that or at what price. But still pretty optimistic we're going to have a little bit more benefit on that between now and the end of the year and maybe even into early 2015. And as we've always described, this is kind of a five to eight-year journey, trying to find the right time to really purchase these assets and make a good positive economic decision for the company.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Should is this the new level \u2013 should we take that as the new base where we are at now?","Mike Upchurch","I think that'd be a good assumption until we communicate additional purchases of assets [inaudible].","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Two quick questions, guys. I guess one we'll stick in the longer-term and then we'll bring it back to this year here. Longer term, obviously you put up the Mexican energy reform and pretty much everyone in the energy side that I talked to feels this is going to happen. Can you tell us how we can sort of track the progress? What's the best thing that we can look at? And where should we start to see that sort of show up in your carload (inaudible) does happen? Are we talking about sort of pipe and sand first before anything else happens?","David Starling","Jos\u00e9 is on the line here. We'll let Jos\u00e9 take a little shot at the energy reform and tell us how he sees that falling out from a legal standpoint or political standpoint.","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya","The energy reform, as you may know, has already been approved generally speaking of the lot, but (inaudible) laws about regulated are in the process of the discussion right now at the Senate. So we expect that to be finalized by the end of this session, so in September and will start being implemented after September. So that is on the political side of it. I don't know if you'll need more information on that one.","David Starling","Yeah, we'll talk a little more about the growth side, what we think we'll see first. I'll take a little shot at it. Well, first of all, we're seeing Pemex be a lot more aggressive. I mean we've got one particular facility where they're starting to build a pipeline out of their facility over to a transload, so they can be more efficient to rail. We've got a transload facility in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, which is going to be converted from transload into a direct delivery into the port facility, so they can transfer direct to vessel. So even now you're seeing Pemex being run a lot more as a business than a government entity. So those are the first subtle changes we're going to see.","And then it's the traditional stuff you're going to see in the US. It's going to be pipelines, pipetrains, frac sand, drilling. You're just going to see more of everything. And then as they can start to export, we think you'll see some petroleum actually going into the US.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yeah, I think I agree on all that. The one thing that you could see, that we could see depending on how the rules are written more quickly and it wouldn't require the kind of infrastructure investment that some of the drilling and other activities would is the importation of refined products into Mexico. So that potentially could happen this year or next year, wouldn't require any infrastructure investment, but that might not be as big a deal as some of the frac sand and crude oil movement. Also remember that the change in the laws isn't just related to oil and gas exploration and production. It also covers refineries and power production. So potentially we could see companies building power plants to compete with federal government in Mexico, or we could see companies building refineries to do their own refining in Mexico. So more questions than answers at this point as to how all of that is going to unfold and the timing. We think it will be significant for us. The timing is going to be obviously extended, and we hopefully will know more about the secondary laws in the next few months.","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","I guess my follow-up question has to do with the comment you made about L\u00e1zaro. You said basically no business growth or not much growth until the second half of '15 when APM opens up the terminal. Can you talk a little bit about why, I guess and that was a little bit surprising that you still see some growth in L\u00e1zaro, I mean, just based on Mexico growing? Could you just explain that?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Well, what I said is that we won't see sustainable double-digit growth until back half of 2014. So we're expecting L\u00e1zaro to grow. I believe we could see occasional blips of double-digit on any given quarter. There seems to be a lot of jockeying back and forth between Manzanillo and L\u00e1zaro and price for market share and ocean carriers making changes to their rotation lineup on an interim basis. So it's going to be a little bit choppier for the next year-and-a-half. When APM opens their terminal, I think we will get back to more steady, sustainable double-digit growth.","David Starling","I guess another way to put it is for the first time, there would be competition in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas.","Pat Ottensmeyer","The other think I think has happened is that L\u00e1zaro has grown, if you think back over to the last three of four years, some of the growth rates we saw there were kind of gravity-defying. It's now gotten larger. And so it goes back to my comment about the intermodal. It's a larger base. So getting those high double-digit growth rates is a little harder to achieve and sustain.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","So I wanted to ask about the Mexican legislation and maybe you can bring us up to date on what you guys know and the things curious about your sense on timing now and I think you tried to talk about, hey, we think there's ways to take the original legislation and make it a little less to bear and maybe get some color on what a less severe or draconian bill might look like. And then how should we think about kind of applying this to the model, if at all? My sense is it allows competition, does enforce competition, so maybe it takes years for this to actually have an impact on any of the business. But would love some comments from you guys as an update.","David Starling","I agree with your interpretation on the second half of the question. Whatever we come up with, it's going to take quite a bit of time to implement. But again, we think we will come to a reasonable conclusion. Certainly the landscape has dramatically changed since the time when you're supposed to pass this build very quickly. Jos\u00e9 and his team have done an excellent job of educating not only the Senate and the Congress, but the other government officials and government officers and the shipper base on how much capital we actually have invested in Mexico and what kind of railroad they have down there and the importance we're to the economy in Mexico.","So we've seen a dramatic shift in the attitude towards the railroad, and that's what we needed to do, and that's changed the landscape of how the negotiations are going. And I'll let Jos\u00e9 kind of give you his view from south of the border and what I just said.","Jos\u00e9 Zozaya","You correctly mentioned. This law has been approved by the House of Deputies and (inaudible) to the Senator. The Senator House has reviewed it and then called for an operating forum where we and other actors were called to give our presentations. And due to the more information we brought in, the President of the Transportation Commission of the Senate has declared that this reform has to be modified before sending back to the House of Deputies. But we are expecting that that will happen in September as the President of the Transportation Commission of the Senate has mentioned. And that will be (inaudible) to the House of Deputies with modifications to the original document on what's approved by the House of Deputies.","David Starling","I think there is something else, Scott, not to forget, we paid $1.4 billion for the concession. It wasn't given to us. So we're in a very strong position where we're with the government investments we have made. We think we'll come to a good outcome. But if not, we have some other courses that we would take if the outcome is not so good. But right now, we're feeling pretty good about it that we've had a lot of meetings with the SET. They support our position. They understand the importance of the railroad. So we think the worst of this is behind us.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Just one quick follow-up on that, just because it's not Mexico regulatory, it's not an area where a lot of us are very close with. When you talk about some sort of moderated bill or legislation, do you think ultimately we end up with a regulatory backdrop that's similar (inaudible) is still better than kind of what we have in the US that seems to be certainly an environment where the rails can do well?","David Starling","We think it's going to be workable, but we're really not in a position to talk about the different parts of the bill right now while we're in negotiation.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","I think we're hearing grain is going to slow in the back half of the year, but some maybe some strategic growth is going to accelerate. Net-net, is that a good or bad thing for margin?","Mike Upchurch","I think it's a good thing. I mean as we look at the mixed issues and I think grain and coal could drop out, as I mentioned, in the fourth quarter and we expect to see some crude oil pick up with some of the terminals that we're serving, adding seaming equipment and just based on some projects that we're working on. And when you add it all up and kind of mix it all up, I think it will be good for margins.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens","You mentioned the additional locomotive you're ordering, but I was curious if these were for lease conversions or growth. And just in general, you also talked about the rolling stock environment tightening in the first quarter. Are you comfortable with your access to equipment right now, or could this potentially be a limiting factor to volume growth as we progress throughout the next few quarters?","David Starling","There is certainly more grain that could be moved. Unfortunately a lot of it is stuck up in other railroad systems right now that we can't get our hands on. But yes, if we had more railcars right now, we could move more grain, but that's not an issue of purchasing cars. That's an issue of them being available. And I think it's pretty much utilized right now with the whole grain (inaudible) setup, and it's a little bit sluggish right now.","As far as the locomotives, this is that year we've been talking about, next year's Tier 4. So I think the conversations we've been having the past couple of months with our suppliers is we think the order books are already full. So everybody is scrambling to get locomotives, while we're still under Tier 3 for about $400,000 cheaper this year compared to what they're going to be in 2015 and beyond. And we've always and our team has been extremely frugal. They always run very, very tight on power. So this is a good time for us to make an acquisition and load up with a Tier 3. So we will again be receiving power through the remainder for the year.","As far as lease conversion on equipment, there is no change to the way Mike explained earlier. We're opportunistic. We've got equipment in our budget every year for the next five years to the growth. And a lot of that could be small hoppers to jumbos. We like to improve the grain fleet with more jumbos. And we've got some old equipment that we probably need to replace. Everything we've learned in the lease conversion is you do get a benefit on the (inaudible) side as well, because you have more owned cars out in the fleet and there is a pop in (inaudible) as well as the savings in the lease versus owned.'","Dave Ebbrecht","Justin, those locomotives are incremental. They don't have anything to do with the lease conversion.","David Starling","Yeah, correct. That was your question. Now these will be new locomotives. They will not be leased locomotives and they're incremental.","Justin Long - Stephens","I guess as my second question, I wanted to ask about coal. The recent pickup we've seen is encouraging. But I was wondering if you could talk the longer-term outlook for your coal business beyond this year? Do you anticipate any major shutdowns from your customers due to regulation in 2015 or beyond that?","David Starling","We have one unit that will go down at the end of 2015, and I think we've talked about that on prior calls. So yeah, the long-term outlook for coal is not great for us. I mean we've had 10 power plants on our network and we're serving nine of them. And so there's not a lot of growth opportunities there. And we see some downside because of new regulations. So it's not going to be a significant decline, but it's going to be a decline in business for us.","Dave Ebbrecht","There's still talk about export coal, so how that's going to work, but there's still few companies that contact us about exporting coal.","David Starling","Port Arthur would be a good place to export coal, but right now, we don't have anything really in the works to develop that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","I wanted to come back to the CapEx outlook in the new locomotives, because of buy and sell. I realize that's going to be 28% of revenue. But how does that factor into the budget looking forward beyond this year? Should we view that as the opportunity to take CapEx down a little bit in the next couple of years?","Mike Upchurch","Well, I think we've talked about CapEx. We've talked about our maintenance CapEx in the past, I think about 10% of revenue. We are getting to the point that over the coming years, you could see that drop from maybe 10% to 9% to 8% just because of the amount of money we've spent in our infrastructure and the condition that it's in. The rest of the capital we would spend would be on normal things to run our business. And then beyond that, it's going to be growth. So if you do see accelerations in capital, it'll be because of growth, but I would say this year is going to turn out to be an exceptional year because of the locomotives and that same kind of range again and we would have a darn good reason on why we're doing it that there would be revenue tied to it.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","And if I'm not mistaken, it sounded like the 2015 outlook is pretty favorable. Is that's what's providing the support here? I mean how do we think about the volume expectations looking beyond 2014 as the acceleration in the business?","Mike Upchurch","Well, as you've seen Pat's chart, it is a long-term story. I mean we've got acceleration in '15 and '16. And then when you get to '17, you got some new drivers. But the other thing you got to remember, some of this is being driven by the fact that you got a new type of locomotive coming out in 2015. That's why GE and (inaudible) going to be full this year. Everybody is buying a locomotive. And we'll always run extremely tight. And this is the year for us to improve the locomotive fleet, because again, some of these opportunities come up like grain this year. We had cars and a little more power (inaudible) grain. So we don't want to find ourselves in that position. Locomotives are your life blood. You can't pull a train without them. So you never want to be in a situation where you don't have enough power.","The other railroads are in the same situation. It's hard to borrow power. I think to the end probably at least everything that was out here this year. So you never apologize for buying locomotives.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","Given some of the service issues experienced by a couple of the other railroads, did you by chance experience any kind of uptick in carloads that would have resulted from that that may not be sustainable given some of that market share ebbs away due to the service issues?","Dave Ebbrecht","I didn't see any increases, maybe slight increase, minimal that was negligible. It seems like most of the congestion stayed up in the Chicago area during the quarter and in the Northeast with the weather issues and there didn't seem to be diversion that ran over KCS at all that was subsequently declined in the second quarter.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","And then secondly, on the ag business, is it possible to give us a little bit of color around kind of the same-store ag business versus maybe the new facility you begin serving in the second half of the year? And just as you look at the quarter's volume, how much of that came out of the new business versus the existing?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Well, a lot of it came out of the new facility, but I'm sure we've kind of concluded that that's new business. I think it's probably more correct to say that they sourced it out of Western Illinois rather than Council Bluffs in Omaha and Lincoln. So it wasn't really true incremental growth for us, but that Jacksonville facility in Western Illinois was a very significant producer for us and for our customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of (inaudible) with Macquarie Group.","Unidentified Analyst","My first question relates to pricing trends in automotive and also in ag. We saw automotive flattish this quarter, whereas ag was really strong. Can you help us understand what you're expecting for the rest of the year and anything unusual that we should be aware of this quarter?","David Starling","I think you're referring to revenue per unit, which is not necessarily tied to pricing. When we take the revenue per unit in ag, it was really driven by length of haul, and that is the cross-border business came back strong and that is a very long haul for us. So you need to kind of separate pricing from revenue per unit. And some of the same situation going on in automotive. We had some disruption in our automotive cross-border business because of constraints on equipment. So that had some downward pressure on revenue per unit, because the length of haul was shorter. In both businesses, we had a negative impact on foreign exchange, because the lot of our automotive businesses is denominated in pesos and foreign exchange was a headwind in the quarter and it would have affected our revenue per unit.","Unidentified Analyst","Did you quantify that foreign exchange impact?","David Starling","Overall, it was about 1% of consolidated in terms of the impact on the automotive business and I don't know that number off the top of my head.","Unidentified Analyst","And then my follow-up is with regards to the outlook for the operating ratio. Could you describe in detail what we should expect on the underlying operating side versus the financing help from the leasing transactions? For the next year, how should we think about this improvement of 100 basis points to 150 basis points (inaudible) management maybe sort of similarly spend next year as contributed by the underlying business side versus financing?","Mike Upchurch","We gave you enough information here to see the impact from the lease conversion. It's roughly $3 million in the quarter. So you can do the math on what that benefit was. So we're still staying with our 100 basis point to 150 basis point guidance and improvement. We think that's pretty solid coming out of the business.","David Starling","But we've not guided into next year. So when we gave that guidance, we factored in the lease conversions. So we knew that was going to be a part of the guidance.","Unidentified Analyst","I seem to remember that maybe on some other occasion towards year-end, you said that you see no reason why this [ph] pace of information continue for a few years out. Can you comment on that at all?","David Starling","It will depend each year as we put our budget. Our plan is to lot of this cargo mix. So I mean that's something that we will look at towards the end of the year as we (inaudible) can't comment right now on the out years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Going back to when you set your year-ahead targets, you had noted growth in the mid-teens instead of in the 20%. Yet if I look at your pace of investments and the things you're scaling up both on locomotive and even from the asset side, are you looking at growing back to that 20%? I guess how do we think about what you're indicating here with this level of investment? And that's a great short-term in terms of your long-term growth opportunities. So does that get you back toward your long-term sustainable growth of 20%?","David Starling","I think if you look at the chart that Pat showed, we're never saying never. But when we changed our guidance, we were looking at the next year to what we were seeing, and that's why we changed our guidance. From a long-term standpoint for the company to get back to 20% or above, yes, but we'll have to look at those opportunities and look at the timing of them. And as we look at the timing of those opportunities, if we need to tweak that up, we'll certainly do that. So that's what we're seeing today.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Just to clarify, the beginning of the sentence there, it sounded like you were saying what we're seeing next year wouldn't be at that 20%, did I hear you right, you said it wouldn't be at the 20%?","David Starling","I said we will need to look at the timing of those opportunities. One thing that we're doing again on the locomotives is a $400,000 less than if you try to buy them in '15. We're understanding that one of the manufacturers may not produce a locomotive in 2015, a Tier 4. It may go more into the rebuild cycle. So we have to be cautious that we can buy locomotives in 2015. So this was a little more of a strategy as well as to make sure that if there is any kind of restriction on locomotives in '15 that we don't find ourselves competing with the buy guys trying to buy power in '15 and can't give an order in, because there's perhaps only manufacturer that's producing a Tier 4.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","And longer-term, still back to that, sounded like you said back to the 20%.","David Starling","No. We said we'll look at those opportunities going forward. And could we get back into 20%s, yes, we could, but we got to look at those opportunities, because if you look at them on the chart, they all have their own start dates, their own start time periods. And we don't want to get out ahead of ourselves and tell you that energy reform is going to start in '17 and for some reason it gets caught up, political process, and (inaudible) '19. So the ethylene plants. I mean to build one of those is a $2 billion decision. So we've got to wait and make sure they're going to be built, when they're going to open. And then we will certainly look at the guidance and if we need to tweak it, we will.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America","Pat, I appreciate the ramp-up on timing that you gave. But I thought you also slipped in there the shortage of equipment. I know you were talking before about intermodal, but it sounded like you said the same thing on auto. Does that mean you go in and you buy more auto cars and is there investment maybe overall on the car side as well? If there is nothing to buy in '15 on locomotives, do you go and make a much larger car investment, or do you still push that to the customer in order to get around some of the (inaudible) I thought you mentioned that if you have more cars, you could be moving more right now.","Dave Ebbrecht","We purchase (inaudible) and we will continually be purchasing to put into that pool, but we were in a pretty good equity position with the TTX pool throughout the quarter and we met all of our demands, even though some of it may have been slightly delayed. On the plant side in Mexico, there's nothing getting across the border. But let me get it straight that the loading on the fleet was up in the 60% range in that all-time highs and it was a very strange fleet across United States.","Pat Ottensmeyer","And my reference, Ken, to the equipment supply was really more first quarter phenomenon because of the general weather-related congestion, because our auto business is for the most part originates and terminates in the Northeast and the Midwest. So that is one area where when Chicago gets fouled up, we will eventually feel it in terms of extended cycle times and constraints on equipment availability. It's not a real long-term situation and I think we worked through it for the most part. But going back to your other part of your question, if we see growth opportunities and we've expressed to our auto customers, if we see growth opportunities for cross-border movements that require us to go out and buy more cars, we said we would be prepared to do that.","Dave Ebbrecht","But again, most of your expense would be overall that we're delivering to. So generally speaking it's CTX buying the cars and then each of us will buy racks for the cars and then we share them. So (inaudible) decision to buy those cars. Same way with the double-stacked cars. You're 53 and you're 40, that's much more of an industry decision. I'm on the trailer term board and we look at replacement, we look at two to three years out. We want to have car orders in. So again, it's much more of an industry decision.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","(inaudible) Could you see us getting near the state now or could you take additional actions to continue this trajectory?","David Starling","I think there are opportunities to continue to improve. I just don't think it'll be at a rate initially seen. I think we'll start to level out more and just hit little stair step improvements, but we still have labor agreements and issues that we can approach in Mexico to realize more latent capacity.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","And really kudos to the finance group for a rapid progress after the (inaudible) rating a year ago, you were trying to (inaudible) leased locomotive. Is there any other such restructuring still remaining in additional locomotive?","David Starling","Well, the lease program includes not just locomotives, but freight cars as well. And so we've executed transactions on both fronts and will continue to look at those leases that generally are more attractive as they get closer to exploration. And that's why it extends over five to eight-year period, which we started back in 2011, I think, was the first transaction we did.","Dave Ebbrecht","In the past, because of our financial condition, we always leased. So now that decision as it comes up is basically you got to replace the equipment under the lease is expiring. We always want to own, but if it's something like (inaudible) or woodchip cars or something that is season car or something that could be a surplus car in a depression, then we're very cautious with that as the other railroads are. But for standard, the average on the system is about 66% ownership. And I think coming out of this conversion this year, it would be about 52%. So as Mike said earlier, we're going to be opportunistic. And as these leases come up, it makes sense to convert them to ownership. We definitely, if we're buying something, we're purchase it in leases or if we need equipment, so we'll keep turning that dial and summing up with more savings. This year was the big year for lease conversion when we went out and made a substantial leap forward.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","In addition to lease conversions and refinance, are there any sort of major engineering covets (inaudible) is there any other sort of financial engineering that you have in mind?","Mike Upchurch","I think those have been the two primary objectives over the last four or five years. And I think from a debt restructuring perspective, we're pretty much at the end of that opportunity. And hence the comments I made earlier about the incremental improvement, which seems in EPS from refinancing activities, we're just not going to see that going forward. And then lease conversion, we're working closely with the operations group to identify when those leases come up and what are the equipments we want to own and if we do, (inaudible) equipment. But outside of that, there's probably nothing significant.","David Starling","And the two important factors for us is we're investment grade. We want to stay investment grade, but yet we still have a lot of room, so that if we needed to go out and make purchases for growth, we certainly have the room to do that and still maintain our financial structure. And we have liquidity. I mean we got caught in 2009 with liquidity. We're never going to let that happen again.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Franz with Raymond James.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","Mike, just a quick modeling question on the fuel side. How much was your fuel price up in Mexico this quarter, and are you guys still feeling that pressure from the state-imposed price increases there?","Mike Upchurch","We are, Tyler. In fact, our fuel price for the first time in Mexico that I can recall was higher than in the US. So we were up 8% on the price per gallon in Mexico and actually down 2% in the US. The official policy is to continue to implement in Mexico small increases each month. But now that we're at a point where actually the (inaudible) price is greater than (inaudible) price remains to be seen. But we'll continue that policy. But this was kind of a first quarter where we saw higher prices in Mexico.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","Is there a fuel surcharge mechanism down there to somewhat inoculate that?","Mike Upchurch","Yes.","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","And then, Pat, if I'm not mistaken, late last year, your competitor down in Mexico kind of launched a cross-border intermodal service, I guess, over Eagle Pass out of Monterrey. And I totally get your traffic was very good and I get (inaudible). I'm just curious upon the margin that impacted you at all, or if there is any change in dynamics down there.","Pat Ottensmeyer","We did lose some business because of that service, but we got some back. And the good news is when we get it back, it gives us an opportunity to move it cross-border. So it's actually a bigger win than a loss. So we did expect that that competing service was announced that we were to lose some business in 2014. We factored that into our guidance and our projections. But ultimately, we think that Loretta was a better gateway and our asset partners are very interested in working with those customers. So the loss that we experienced was not significant.","David Starling","The other thing you got to think of is we were spending a lot of capital in Monterrey to expand Monterrey. It was a 150-mile line haul out of it. So it sure makes a lot of sense for us to have a big foray lined up for the cross-border train that goes up in our network.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Mims with FBR Capital Markets.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","So I just had one follow-up on the auto business. So you have the (inaudible)?","David Starling","We're having a little trouble hearing you. I think what you're asking is how is the balance work of the auto equipment. We looked for every opportunity we can to get a back haul in the Mexico. And there are auto manufacturers in the US that sell in Mexico. In fact, we will use some of our outbound facility (inaudible) as an inbound RDC, so we can bring cars in and then finish the others and to look for the Mexico city market and load those back with outbound cars. But it's clearly in balance and everyone tries to price that in to their roundtrip economics.","Pat Ottensmeyer","But it's similar if you think about the grain business. It's heavy empty back haul, the coal business, and you just price it into the business.","David Starling","We have some (inaudible) load both ways, but that's very rare.","John Mims - FBR Capital Markets","But I understand that (inaudible) works now. But as the Mexican business really ramps up, is that still the case or do you mean to deploy a lot more time and a lot more empty back haul back down into Mexico just to satisfy the new (inaudible) going on down there?","David Starling","We'll have to add capacity. But again, the pricing and the contribution on that business is quite high. So we'll add capacity, locomotives and cars and it will be a slower ramp up, so it's not going to be a big capital commitment right upfront. But we factored that into our growth plans and our capital plans.","Pat Ottensmeyer","I mean we have a lot of times that the CTX purchase for the auto cars.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the conference back to management for any closing comments.","David Starling","Okay. The only closing comment I have is everyone have a Happy Easter and if you're trying to get home, travel safe. Nice long holiday and we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"12342":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 18, 2013  8:45 AM ET","Executives","David L.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2012, filed with the SEC. The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found at the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David L. Starling","Good morning, and welcome to the Kansas City Southern's third quarter conference call. Joining me as presenters this morning are Dave Ebbrecht, EVP and Chief Operating Officer; Pat Ottensmeyer; EVP of Sales and Marketing; and Mike Upchurch, EVP and Chief Financial Officer. Also, Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, our President and Executive Rep of KCSM will be available for questions later on this call.","We will start with our third quarter overview. In light of the stubborn, unsettled economy, we feel good to have achieved a record quarter revenue growth of 8%. This past quarter illustrated that the diversity of KCS' commodity mix allows us to more than compensate for periodic shortfalls in particular business areas by achieving strong growth in others.","Typically, KCS' coal business is solid in the third quarter. However, this year, a mild summer and low natural gas prices contributed to coal revenues being down 2%. Also hurting us was the decision of one of our coal customers to shut down 2 generating units in one of our plants on October 1, rather than December; that's when they did it last year. Their decision to shut down earlier resulted in reduced coal shipments for that plant in the third quarter.","Another area in which third quarter revenues fall so much short of our expectations was in our crude business. While revenues from crude carloads were up 8%, that's a far cry from the 195% revenue increase we reported in the second quarter. The slowdown was directly related to the impact of narrowing spreads between WTI and Brent prices. Our Bakken and Eagle Ford car-loadings are certainly down, but heavy crude car-loading from Canada had remained fairly strong. But these less than spectacular developments were more than offset by other commodities. For example: revenue from metals were up 16%; grain was up 11% due to a late surge in the quarter; petroleum coke was up 39%; and cross-border revenue grew by 16% and accounted for nearly 24% of total consolidated revenues. And of course, our cross-border intermodal growth continued at an exceptional pace, increasing by 73%. The importance of this diverse mix of business cannot be overstated.","Railroads operate in environments in which markets can change quickly and dramatically due to economic and weather conditions, as well as a host of other market dynamics. Having a diverse commodity mix provides greater stability and can allow for strong growth even when the market shifts occur. This certainly held through in our third quarter.","Also holding through was a continuation of excellent operating performance, which was a prime contributor to KCS attaining a third quarter operating ratio of 67.8%. Our OR was tracking a bit better into the quarter, but our system was hit by tropical storms in Mexico, which added some operating expense while costing us some revenue. The fact is, railroading is an outdoor sport, and we just have to roll with those circumstances.","Finally, it's definitely worth noting that the great drought-induced grain nightmare is over. Not only did we [indiscernible] late in the quarter, so far in the fourth quarter, our export grain loadings are up in the very high double digits from a year ago and should continue to be strong throughout the quarter.","The next chart, Third Quarter Results, just summarizes our third quarter results and doesn't need any extensive remarks from me. Pat and Mike will provide more detail.","Let's go to the next slide, the Update for Q3. Carloads are up 3%. While that's a pretty solid number, given market conditions and tepid economic growth, it's a little shy of what we had expected. As I mentioned earlier, coal and crude were not as strong as we had thought they would be. Also, automotive car-loadings were flat due to tough year-over-year comps, plus the fact that a number of the plants we're serving are operating near capacity due to the growing demand for vehicles made in Mexico. While this capacity situation will impact us in the short run, the situation will begin to improve in 2014 with the 3 new plants coming online, and we're looking forward to continued capacity expansion through 2018. And Pat will provide more color on the autos.","There is still too many economic uncertainty for us to be able to make an exact carload growth projection for the year, but we do believe we'll end 2013 on a strong note, and certainly our strong fourth quarter grain shipments will help. With the exception of our long-term coal contracts, which are based on rail inflation index, our coal pricing remains well above inflation, and Pat will discuss more detail on pricing.","","Through 3 quarters, our revenue growth is 5%, in line with our mid-single digit projection. We expect a good revenue quarter, so we're very optimistic of hitting our 2013 revenue growth target.","Lastly, we had improved our operating ratio by 1 point for the first 3 quarters, and believe that, barring unforeseen circumstances, we should have good OR performance in the fourth quarter.","So with that, I'll turn the presentation over to Dave Ebbrecht, but will come back at the end to sum things up and provide some thoughts as for the fourth quarter. Dave?","David R. Ebbrecht","Thanks, David, and good morning.","Let's turn to Slide 9. This chart continues to represent our ability to control costs and depicts a significant upswing in volume we have seen towards the end of the quarter. Operations has done a good job of accommodating the growth, especially considering that we had significant manifest growth through Shreveport and the Meridian Speedway.","Shreveport handled 8,400 cars more, and Jackson handled 6,600 cars more, mostly during the second half of the quarter. Our modeling efforts continue to be accurate for our locomotive and car fleet demand to accommodate our growth profile. Accordingly, we have been continuously growing our railcar fleets. And we'll start to receive our 35 new engines in November to accommodate the volume surge in the fourth quarter, which has been dominated by the resurgence of long-haul grain. Overall, we'll continue to see a positive trend and remain relatively flat on expenses for the foreseeable future.","On Slide 10, on the bar portion of the chart, you can see our headcount continues to slightly increase with our recent in-sourcing of contracted services in Mexico. But we'll continue to scale headcount well below our volume increases. We also held back on reducing our crew base associated with our grain routings during the second and third quarter. And now we're in very good shape given the grain has come back in full swing. In the future, we will see increased traffic build on our secondary lines. This will enable us to more fully allocate our train crews and support staff against the larger volumes of demand and provide further economies of scale. We'll continue to hire in areas we need to accommodate our high-growth profile, but our trend will continue to show increased productivity.","On Slide 11, some of our operating metrics saw slight variations in the third quarter, but they are still indicative of very solid performance, and well above the range needed to execute our transportation service plan: velocity was at 27.2 miles per hour and better than the third quarter of 2012; dwell was at 19.9 versus 18.3 the year prior, and mostly due to the increased volume of cars processed through Shreveport and Jackson. Increased volumes through higher dwell processing terminals will naturally elevate our system dwell and increases the cars online, but have no material impact on efficiency or connectivity. There was a slight degradation of our efficiency metrics in Mexico when tropical storm Manuel hit during Mexican Independence Day on September 16, and caused a weeklong disruption between Mexico City and L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Maintenance away also had major activity on our line between Shreveport and Kansas City that increased the disturbed track slow orders during the quarter.","We'll continue to accommodate our growth projections and change the operations necessary to optimize our efficiencies.","Now, I'll turn it over to Pat for sales and marketing update.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay. Good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 13.","As you saw earlier, revenues for the third quarter were $621.6 million, up 8% from last year and a new record for any quarter in our company's history. Carloads was 3% higher than last year and also a new quarterly record. As you can see on this slide, revenues were higher in all 6 of our major business units, including Ag & Minerals, which is the first time that we've seen that all year. Foreign exchange was a very slight positive during the quarter, adding about $1.2 million in total revenues, or less than 1%.","Revenues in our Chemical & Petroleum business were 3% higher, in spite of a 1% decline in volumes. Reduced shipments from 2 major customers, both in Mexico, more than explained the volume reduction in this entire business unit during the quarter. These are both temporary situations relating to weather, and some shifts in electricity production that reduced our fuel oil shipments to power plants in Mexico during the quarter. As a result, our petroleum business showed lower volumes and revenues of 12% and 3%, respectively, versus last year. Both of these customers are expected to return to more normal levels during the fourth quarter. You will also recall that we report crude oil shipments in our Energy business unit, and not in this one.","Revenues in our Industrial & Consumer business grew by 7% on flat volumes from last year. Metals and scrap were the primary growth drivers, with revenues and volumes increasing by 16% and 7%, respectively. We saw particularly strong cross-border shipments in this commodity group, with cross-border revenues and volumes both increasing by more than 40% versus last year. Appliances, while small, and scrap paper shipments, were also strong during the quarter. Average length of haul increased by about 5% in this business, largely driven by the increase in cross-border shipments. Lumber, Plywood and Other were the weaker performers in this group.","As I mentioned earlier, we saw year-over-year growth in Ag & Minerals for the first time this year, with volumes up 6% and revenues up 7%, versus last year. Grain shipments in the southern U.S. part of our network, Mississippi and Louisiana, began to pick up in September and we saw particularly -- particular strength in export grain during the quarter. Revenues for export increased by 13% on volume growth of 15%. Ores and Minerals were also strong with revenue growth of 22% and volume of 28%. We're seeing some recovery of sand and rock shipments into the Haynesville shale region around Shreveport, which were very low last year. I'll talk more about crop conditions and the grain outlook in a few moments.","Our Energy business unit recorded revenue growth of 6% on volume growth of 2%. There's a bit of a story behind these numbers, and that is that utility coal was weak, as Dave mentioned earlier, with volumes and revenues declining by 6% and 2%, respectively. And all other commodities increased in this group. Frac sand and pet coke were particularly strong and crude oil continued to grow, but at a lower rate than we've seen in prior quarters.","Pet coke revenue was, as Dave mentioned, 39% higher than last year due to the increased export shipments from the Motiva refinery in Port Arthur, Texas. We expect this business to continue at current levels going forward.","Frac sand revenues increased by 22% on volume growth of 15%, as we saw strong shipments in all of the producing regions that we served during the quarter, including Haynesville, as I mentioned earlier.","Crude oil revenues increased by 8% on about a 1% volume increase. We did see significant declines in crude shipments that -- out of the Bakken region and West Texas due to compression of commodity spreads. We're still seeing good activity and strength from Western Canada. And there has been some modest recovery of Bakken shipments recently, as spreads have widened.","As for the outlook for Port Arthur Crude Terminal, that project continues to move along through due diligence, and there have been no major surprises. However, we are not in a position to announce further details of that agreement at this time. We did complete the purchase of 29 acres adjacent to our land in Port Arthur this week -- in fact, we are closing today -- which will give us access to a barge loading facility adjacent to that property. I think we talked about this property purchase on the second quarter call. And this property acquisition is clearly an indicator of our confidence that the larger terminal project that we've discussed will move forward and eventually will be completed.","Intermodal continues its very solid growth rates, with revenues increasing by 17% on volume growth of 6%. The main driver here, as in the past, is Cross-border Intermodal, which recorded revenue growth of 73% on volume growth of 71%.","Revenues related to L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas business grew by 4% on a 3% decline in units, which was the first time ever that we have seen volume decline at L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. I'll talk more about that in a couple of minutes.","Finally, revenues in our Automotive business grew by 7% on volumes that were essentially flat to last year. This also is a bit of a departure from previous quarters where we've seen growth rates in the mid-teens or even higher. Automobile production at plants we serve in Mexico declined by about 7% versus third quarter of 2012, with the biggest drop in production occurring at a Volkswagen plant in Puebla, which is the largest plant in Mexico, and one of our largest shippers. We know that the Puebla VW plant operated at very high capacity utilization last year. In fact, it was over 100%. And third quarter production -- levels of production for 2013 were in the 93% utilization level, in part due to a slow start following the Mexican Independence Day holiday. We also saw some production declines from a large customer due to unexpected quality holds following a model changeover. That is not the case going forward. Again, we'll talk about the auto outlook more in a few moments.","Slide 14, you can see our cross-border revenue surged in the third quarter to an all-time record level of $147 million, and represented almost half of our total revenue growth during the quarter. All business units recorded gains from last year, with the main drivers being: Intermodal; Industrial & Consumer, primarily the steel and appliance shipments I talked about earlier; Ag & Minerals; and Automotive. Cross-border grain grew by 26% from last year, and this was the first quarter since -- first quarter of 2012 that we saw year-over-year growth in cross-border grain. This should continue to be a source of strength into the foreseeable future.","On Slide 15, we show the revenue growth attributed to our 5 strategic growth areas, which this quarter was a combined 16%, or double our overall revenue growth rate for the quarter. Cross-border intermodal and frac sand were the primary drivers, with growth rates of 73% and 22%, as you can see on the chart. As I mentioned earlier, our crude oil shipments out of the Bakken region fell pretty dramatically due to commodity spreads that made rail shipments uncompetitive from that region. The WTI\/Brent spread has recently widened to levels that we believe will move crude oil by rail. And, in fact, we've seen some modest recovery of Bakken shipments very recently. Our shipments from Western Canada have remained fairly strong. As we've said in the past, long term, we believe the Western Canada crude will be our primary commodity delivered to Port Arthur.","The revenue growth of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas was only 4% during the quarter on volume declines of 3%. As I mentioned earlier, this is the first time ever that we have seen volumes fall at L\u00e1zaro. There are a couple of major factors that explain what's going on there. The most significant is a dramatic reduction in aluminum shipments for 1 particular customer that resulted in a reduction of over 10,000 units compared to last year. So call that an unfavorable comp. And adjusting for that reduction in that 1 particular customer, all other volume increased by about 18% from last year. We will have a similar bad comp situation in the fourth quarter of this year, but should be back to normal comps beginning next year.","In addition, as Dave Ebbrecht mentioned, we experienced some network interruptions due to flooding in Southern Mexico during the quarter. And we estimate that cost us about 2,500 units during the quarter. Adjusting for this, which we believe is timing, as the highways were also out of service during that period, we would've seen volumes increase by about 2%.","As I've mentioned before, looking longer term, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas will be a very important strategic growth area for us. The new APM Terminal is under construction and scheduled to open in early 2015. And our pipeline of new business opportunities continues to grow.","Moving on to Slide 16. As Dave Starling mentioned earlier, our market outlook hasn't changed significantly since we showed you this in April. And we're still looking for mid-single digit revenue growth for the full year 2013 on a consolidated basis. However, you will see on this slide that the market outlook for some of the business units has changed since our last report: Ag & Minerals is a little stronger, driven primarily by better-than-expected shipments in the third quarter and a strong outlook for the fourth quarter. Again, this will be driven primarily by growth in export and cross-border grain shipments.","Our outlook for the Energy business is a little weaker than we expected in April, driven by reduction in Bakken crude oil shipments, as I mentioned, and weaker outlook for utility coal. As many of you know, and Dave mentioned earlier, one of our power plants we serve in Texas has become a seasonal producer, with the season being the summer cooling period. This isn't a new development. We saw the same situation last year. We just weren't certain that it would happen again this year because natural gas prices are higher now than they were a year ago. We have to assume this is going to be a recurring issue in 2014 and possibly beyond. That probably means that fourth quarter for utility coal will look a little bit worse than last year, primarily because the outage this year is going to occur in October, versus December last year. And the full year 2013 will be a little worse than all of 2012 for utility coal. However, growth in frac sand and crude oil will still push the Energy business unit overall into positive single-digit territory. We'll update full year 2014 guidance for coal in January.","We are still expecting double-digit growth in Automotive for 2013 in spite of a drop in growth rates during the third quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we had some unfavorable comps and quality holds during the third quarter that we do not expect going forward. If you look at our AAR data, our sequential volumes are up in this business more than 20% from third quarter levels. Also, we will begin to see some activity from the new Nissan plant in December. And the Honda and Mazda plants are opening in the Salaya area in the first quarter of 2014.","Finally, on Slide 17, as Dave mentioned, the much anticipated grain crop is now coming in. And we are beginning to see strength in our export and cross-border business in September that should continue into 2014. The addition of the 2 new shuttle loading facilities that opened this summer on our network will make our grain franchise even stronger than it already was.","Cross-border intermodal will continue to be a significant growth driver going forward. And in spite of our exceptional growth here for the last several years, we are still barely at 3% market share of the estimated 3 million truck market, so there continues to be tremendous opportunity for truck-to-rail conversions and growth in this business for a long time to come. We are also seeing some renewed and stronger interest in international cross-border from some of the ocean carriers that call on L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, primarily into the Houston and Gulf Coast markets. I believe we will be talking more about this in 2014 and the years ahead.","We continue to feel good about the current pricing environment and outlook. If we exclude the impact of our long-term coal contracts, which as Dave mentioned are generally priced off of rail inflation indexes that have been very low recently, we continue to see mid-single digit pricing increases in the rest of our business. We do not see that changing in the near future.","Finally, our new business pipeline is strong and growing. We've talked a lot about the new auto plants that are coming online, steel facilities, grain elevators and, of course, the new emerging energy opportunities. Next year, you will hear us talking more about some of the ethane and propane refineries that are planned for the U.S. Gulf Coast. And hopefully, we will be talking a lot more about new opportunities that will be made possible by energy reform in Mexico.","With that, I will turn the presentation over to Mike Upchurch.","Michael W. Upchurch","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start my comments on Slide 19 and provide a few key highlights on our income statement.","First of all, revenues had indicated, increased 8%, well above our volume growth of 3%. Expenses increased 6%, providing incremental margins of 44% in an operating ratio of 67.8% for the quarter.","Interest expense continued to decline $6 million year-over-year or approximately 25% as a result of our refinancing activity during the second quarter. Our average effective interest rate was 4% for this quarter compared to almost 6% in the third quarter of 2012. The peso ended the quarter at about the same rate as the second quarter and resulted in about a $1 million loss. Also, during the quarter, we repurchased $13 million of our 6 1\/8 KCSM notes and incurred $2.4 million in debt retirement costs associated with the premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs.","Our effective income tax rate was 34.7%, consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter. And I'll provide a little bit more detail on that in a few slides.","Finally, reported EPS was $1.07, while adjusted EPS was $1.10, up 16% from third quarter of 2012.","On Slide 20, we provided a brief reconciliation of recorded to adjusted EPS. And consistent with our prior reporting, we've adjusted for debt retirement costs and FX impacts in the period, and we've also provided some additional details in the appendix for your information. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 16% to $1.10 per share.","Moving to Slide 21. You can see our reconciliation of the U.S. statutory rate of 35%, to the quarter effective tax rate of 34.7%, and what we expect for the full year of 35.5%. As you can see, there is minimal impact this quarter, or for the year, on foreign exchange as the peso has been relatively stable at period end and based on the forward curve of around 13.","Moving to Slide 22, I'd like to spend a little bit of time on our operating expenses. Overall, our operating expense trends increased 6% year-over-year, driven primarily by fuel, which accounted for more than 50% of this increase. The other key driver that increased expense was higher depreciation, which resulted from both higher capital expenditures to support our growth and the purchase of assets under lease. And I'll provide more detail on expenses in the next several slides. However, overall, we continue to tightly manage our expenses on a year-over-year basis.","On Slide 23, our compensation and benefits expense increased 2.7% to $111 million. The primary drivers behind increased compensation costs were wage inflation and increased headcount. Overall, FTE increased 1.8%. However, excluding the in-sourced contract that we discussed earlier in the year for our truck maintenance in Mexico, FTE was up less than 1%, reflecting, again, strong productivity in our operations group, as volumes grew 3% in the quarter.","On Slide 24, let me cover our equipment costs: they declined $3 million year-over-year, largely due to the purchase of leased locomotive completed during the second quarter of 2013. And offsetting those declines were slight increases in car hire, which are the result of increased volumes during the quarter.","Moving to fuel expense on Slide 25. Fuel expense increased $103 million due to higher prices and volume. Prices in the U.S. increased from $3 in the third quarter of 2012 to $3.15 in the current quarter or an increase of about 5%. While we saw higher increases in fuel costs in Mexico, second -- or third quarter of 2012, our price per gallon was $2.61 and in the third quarter of 2013, $2.97. So in overall, 14% increase in fuel prices, as Mexico continues to move pricing more closely aligned with global prices. So this is clearly a bit of a differentiator with some of the U.S.-based carriers. Because of rising fuel cost, we estimate the negative lag impact during the quarter to be approximately $3 million, or $0.02 per share.","Moving to depreciation on Slide 26. We saw an increase to $57 million in the quarter. Higher capital expenditures contributed $5 million to that increase, while the purchase of leased assets contributed $2 million to the increase in depreciation. And as I mentioned earlier, we saw the offsetting benefit of purchasing leased assets; in the equipment expenses, we saw a reduction of, $4 million as a result of those purchases.","Finally, on Slide 27, I'd like to review our capital structure priorities and our cash priorities. First and foremost, we will continue to invest beyond historical industry level to capture the growth opportunity we see in the marketplace. Accordingly, we have slightly increased our CapEx to revenue guidance for the year to 26%, as we placed an order for an additional 10 locomotives during the quarter, so we now have a delivery in a total of 35 units by the end of the year. In addition to ensuring we have the necessary assets in place to deliver our growth plans, we also benefit from bonus depreciation by accepting delivery by the end of the year.","And that bonus depreciation, we do not expect to continue into 2014. And that provides a nice tax benefit to us.","We also have some additional opportunities to continue optimizing our capital structure. Currently, we are engaged in discussions with various lessors about the possibility to acquire assets under lease. And as you know, this is consistent with our strategy that we've been executing over the last 2 years. Since the interest rate environment continues to be favorable, we believe there is a good return available to KCS by buying equipment under lease. It is important to note that, depending on the purchase price of those assets, it is possible we could incur some lease termination charges that would require us to take a onetime nonrecurring charge. We currently expect any transaction that we execute to be both NPV and earnings accretive, while also benefiting our operating ratio. And depending on the total amount of equipment that would be economically viable for us to acquire, we also have some refinancing opportunities with the remaining 8% and 6.125% notes, which have a total remaining balance of $92 million. So that's something we could certainly roll into a new financing.","Finally, we paid a third quarter dividend of $0.215, which amounted to almost $24 million in cash during the quarter.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave Starling.","David L. Starling","Thanks, Mike. Before opening the call up for questions, I'd like to first reemphasize that we, at KCS, feel very good about our third quarter. As I noted earlier, the strengths of our franchise consistently overcome any periodic weaknesses caused by economic or market conditions or weather. We're every bit as confident that this will continue to be the future. As Pat stated, we feel very good about our new business pipeline, with the new auto plants and the steel facilities opening in Mexico, new grain elevators located in our system and more energy opportunities. The U.S. Gulf continues to provide more opportunities with crude-by-rail, possible new ethane propane refineries, and the new political reforms for the energy sector in Mexico could provide opportunities for our power franchise. We feel very confident that we can execute at a high level on what we can control. And that provides us with an overall positive outlook for the fourth quarter, for instance. With the fear of another poor harvest no longer a threat, KCS' grain carloads should be a record or near record levels from now into 2014. Our cross-border intermodal should continue to grow at high double-digit levels and grain and intermodal should continue to increase KCS' cross-border revenues. Generally, with the exception of coal, we believe the majority of our commodity group should perform well in the months ahead. In addition, our rail operation should continue to be strong, resulting in a continuation of our industry-leading productivity metrics. And you could be assured that we'll maintain stringent control of our operating costs, which will further enhance profitability. We continue to believe that the contributions from all our emerging business opportunities provide us with a degree of confidence that, over the long term, KCS can continue to grow its business at a higher rate than the industry average. While secular economic trends and conditions will certainly play a part in determining what the exact percentages of that growth will be, we believe that KCS has the opportunity to continue to be a growth leader in the transportation space. We remain very bullish on the opportunities our franchise provides for the next several years and beyond. As you all know, railroads have franchises which cannot be duplicated, and we will play a major role in the continued economic growth of North America.","With that, I'd be happy to take your questions. We're still going to do one question and one follow-up. And I'll turn it over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. I wanted to ask you about, how you think of sensitivity of your volume growth story to what the Mexican economy does? And we talked a lot about cross-border and driven by new planned investment, and U.S. economy and various things. But how much sensitivity do you think there is to pace the growth in the Mexican economy? And I guess I'm thinking about L\u00e1zaro, in particular, which has been slower. Is that something that we should really be thinking about when we look at our forecast for 2014?","David L. Starling","Well, I'll start, Tom, and let Pat add the commentary. First of all, L\u00e1zaro, what we've had at L\u00e1zaro is this comp on the aluminum that kind of was wonderful when we had it. There was a huge movement. It moved -- was shipped in to support a plant, so it was great volume. We're now kind of back into the more normal Mexican market that we're serving. What we think will happen is with a new APM Terminal being built, that you will then have more competition in L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, and we'll have more of an opportunity to take market share from Manzanillo, in addition to enjoying just the organic growth of the economy. So L\u00e1zaro is almost a little bit like the cross-border intermodal that could be more market for us to take that is not relative to growth. It would be taking share from Manzanillo. And as far as the Intermodal, we don't see that changing and we don't see the grain movements changing. So again, with the economy in Mexico grows at a smaller rate, we're still going to see the Intermodal grow just because of the conversion. Then the auto plants, Pat, I'll let you talk about the auto plants.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes. I think I wouldn't suggest that we are immune or disconnected from what's going on in the economy. We'll certainly be affected by that. But just picking up on what Dave said, one of the factors that I didn't mention about L\u00e1zaro that we can't really quantify but, there was a new terminal facility opened in Manzanillo. We think there was some market share shift, perhaps because of the new facility coming on and trying to attract business with pricing. I think the fact that we will have, beginning in 2015, we will have another terminal and some competition at L\u00e1zaro will be helpful. The fact is, we have -- we really have 1 terminal operator there now so you don't have that competitive dynamic going on at L\u00e1zaro that you do the other Mexican ports. The cross-border intermodal, again, because a lot of that is truck-to-rail conversion of existing traffic, we think that, that could grow even if the economy weakens. But the fact is that business is growing so we're getting the sort of the double whammy on the positive side. We're getting conversion opportunities of existing truck traffic and then that market is growing. And as Dave mentioned, finally, we've -- I think one of the factors that we've seen with auto production in Mexico is capacity utilization is very high in the plants because -- In the plants in Mexico, as I mentioned, we look at some of the capacity utilization figures of the plants we serve and they have been over 100%, which means they're using more overtime. But they've been over 100% of stated capacity for several of the last few quarters. We're going to have about 600,000 or 650,000 new vehicle capacity coming online in the next 4, 5 months. So that should provide a little bit of a cushion and some pickup there. As you know, Nissan is opening in December, and Mazda and Honda are opening in the first quarter of 2014. So not only will we see new vehicles coming out of those plants -- and, obviously, the rate of capacity utilization will be driven by the overall rate of automobile sales -- but as we've said in the past, not just the finished vehicles, we'll see auto parts shipments, we'll see steel and plastics and all of the other things that fit into the finished vehicle funnel. So kind of a long-winded explanation, but we feel pretty optimistic about what's going on in Mexico.","Michael W. Upchurch","Tom, this is Mike Upchurch. Let me just give you a couple of quick macro data points that we track in our business that are fairly correlated to our carload volumes that might indicate some upward momentum coming out of Mexico. First of all, GDP estimates for the fourth quarter and going into '14 would appear to be 1 point to 1.5 points higher than what we've seen this year. There's a basket index, which is really a measure of domestic consumption, that's been showing some recent strength in Mexico. You also have PMI, which is improving there. And then I think lastly, with the government now largely settled on a number of the strategic initiatives they want to pursue, I think some of the slower government spending that we've seen should begin to accelerate. So all those data points would suggest to us that we're going to see a strengthening environment in Mexico.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, that is great. I appreciate all the color, very helpful answer. My follow-up would be along the same lines, I guess, in terms of outlook: the way I've modeled volumes, I mean you've had about 5% volume growth in 2012. I think, roughly, you're about to say you're 3.5%, 4% this year, assuming we're not way off in the fourth quarter model. And then looking to 2014 and '15, I've got -- assuming it ramps to high single digits, let's call it 9%, 10%. Is that maybe a little bit different from consensus, but I'm guessing that generally people are thinking that way. Is it realistic, given what you see, to see that sharp of a ramp in your volumes if you look out to next year, or to 2015?","Michael W. Upchurch","Well, we haven't given any specific guidance. As you know, we typically do that in January, on our fourth quarter call. But I think your thought process around acceleration of volumes would certainly seem logical, given some of the ramp-up, in Auto and maybe a slightly improving economy. There are, as you know, uncertainties such as the coal business, and what happens with spreads. But I think the logic of better growth in 2014 certainly holds true, and that's what we believe will happen.","David L. Starling","I think the other thing too, Tom, is the grain will carryover into 2014, and we didn't have that last year. So when you didn't have the harvest in the fourth quarter then we had no carryover into '13. But you'll certainly see the grain carrying over into 2014 this year.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so it sounds like that's not -- it's hard to be precise about it, but it's not an unrealistic framework?","David L. Starling","Not at all.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wanted to maybe start on crude. Pat, you mentioned the closing of the barge terminal, I guess, today. So as you think about kind of getting that piece of property in place, can you talk a little bit about the shorter term opportunity in crude, probably before Port Arthur ultimately gets developed? I just want to get a sense of roughly how you get from where we are right now to the potential of what Port Arthur could bring in 1 year-plus from now.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay. There are a couple of other crude facilities and the capacity has been built in the Port Arthur, Beaumont area. We've talked about some of this on prior calls, but there are now 3 facilities that are up and running in that region, in that area that we could deliver crude to. We are also looking at, as I think you may know, we have a pet coke terminal adjacent to the vacant land that we're hoping to build the crude terminal on. There's an existing loop track. There's an existing vessel loader. That's where we run the Motiva pet coke over from their refinery to this facility for export. We're looking at some options in the near term that we could possibly accelerate, reconfigure -- not reconfigure, but configure that facility for possible crude oil shipments, as well. So the capacity has been built. There are other facilities in the Port Arthur, Beaumont area that we can serve, we have access to. There are also other facilities: Lake Charles; we're moving crude oil to a refinery in the Tuscaloosa area; there are a couple of new facilities coming on in the Baton Rouge, New Orleans areas. So capacity is being built. So it's not that -- we don't have to have this Port Arthur crude terminal we've been talking about build before for us to be able to grow in the near term. There is capacity there today that we can serve.","David L. Starling","Yes. I might add, Chris, the one facility that Pat talked about will have capital money in for 2014. We're actually going to pull it in to 2013 and start to build more steaming capability on the Tuscaloosa line and another receiving track at Artesia, because the plant we're handling there is at capacity. We need to be able to get more product to them to get it steamed ahead of time. So there's still opportunity there. That one's probably not going to ramp up until I'd say the first quarter, we'll start to see growth there. And then Jefferson Refinery, as Pat mentioned, while they've put the loop track in, they have not finished the steaming capability. So they've still got to add that, put in the steaming capability and that means that the heavy Canadian could come in to Jefferson Refinery, which seems to be much less affected by the spread.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And I guess that was going to be my follow-up question was about spread sensitivity. Some of those opportunities that you mentioned sound like maybe a little bit more Western Canada-focused. But I wanted to get a rough sense, I think you've shown us in recent slides how some of the Bakken and sort of spot moves can drop off pretty sharply and I think we saw that in the results. Is there a better benchmark that we can use for kind of gauging when you're going to be moving that with the spreads? I mean I think we've expanded a bit here and I think, Pat, you alluded to moving a little bit in the shorter term here, but just to get a rough sense of sort of what your customers tell you about the sensitivity to that?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Well, I think the results kind of speak for themselves. What the customers are saying is that when the WTI\/Brent spread gets real tight, it just doesn't make sense to ship out of the Bakken. So I still think that's a valid benchmark. For Western Canada, we're looking at the Maya spreads and Western Canadian Select tells a more accurate picture.","David L. Starling","I think there's a lag time on the spreads.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes, there is a lag. This isn't like trading bonds or stocks, or something like that. Because of the way crude is priced and the way it's delivered, it could take 60 days or so before -- when the spread widens again, before we actually see it in terms of volumes on the railroad.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Bill Greene from Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Pat, can I ask for a little bit more color around your pricing commentary? You're pretty clear on there's a difference between sort of how coal, for example, reprices and how some of the other businesses do. But maybe you can give us a sense more kind of the blend? I don't know how much of the business is actually tied to escalators in any given year and how much of the business is actually gets kind of a renewal that's in this mid-single digit range you referred to?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Well, I would say this, all of our coal business is in some sort of index formula-based pricing. And if you look at some of the rail, economic rail inflation indicators recently, they've been very, very low. So our coal contracts, for the -- well, for the most part, I think, in total, I would -- The way to describe it is they're on autopilot, as far as pricing is concerned, until the contracts expire and we renegotiate the base. So with rail inflation in the U.S. being so low, our rate increases on coal contracts are going to track accordingly. The rest of the business -- yes, I mean, we've got -- some of our other business, obviously, is on contract with pricing escalators or inflation-based escalators. Not a large percentage of that. The other thing that we have mentioned and, again, where we're a little bit different than the other Class 1s is Mexico. The norm in Mexico is that most of the businesses on shorter term, 1 year or less contracts. And so we'll be seeing renewal cycles in the first quarter, heavy renewal cycles, take place in the first quarter of every year in Mexico and, generally speaking, all of our business is repriced in Mexico. There -- I mean, there are some long-term contracts but it's a much smaller percentage of our base than it would be in the U.S. Mexico inflation is a little higher than the U.S. so that's one of the reasons, I think, over time, you'll see our pricing guidance and outlook is maybe a little bit higher than the rest of the industry because of the impact of Mexico, the short length of term and the higher inflation rates in Mexico.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Very helpful. Can I ask one follow-up just on grain? I'm not sure how to think about the mix impact here. Normally, sort of from a seasonal perspective, OR is kind of maybe a little bit better in the fourth quarter, but maybe grain changes that dynamic pretty significantly? Can you just comment, or give any color, on how to think about that?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Well, what, specifically? I guess I'm not sure what you're asking.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Well, so normally you would see about a 50-basis-point improvement or so in OR. But if grain picks up significantly in the fourth quarter, perhaps the mix effect of that could make the outcome far better. And I don't know if that's maybe overstating the impact that grain could have on a quarterly basis or if there's anything about the seasonality to keep in mind there?","Michael W. Upchurch","Hey, Bill, this is Mike Upchurch. I think the one thing in the grain business, we own most of that equipment or have it on longer-term leases. So when the grain was moving, there was a cost in our P&L. So as that revenue comes back, I think you're right, there'll be a general improvement in the margins from that business, if that's what you're asking about?","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. It was just all else held equal, right, seasonality suggests there should be some slight improvement in margins anyway. But does grain make that a bigger change than you'd normally assume? All else held equal, I think the answer is yes, it does. So the fourth quarter looks like a pretty good set up. But I don't want to put words in your mouth, so that's why I was just asking.","David L. Starling","We love grain, I'll say that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Dave, if I can just follow on the grain discussion. Maybe can you talk in terms of scale? I know you've got these 2 new elevators that have opened up on your network and you've got the crop coming online, do the elevators on your network actually add volume or is that more a profit kind of view? And then on the crop itself, can you talk maybe in terms of scale of what you expect and do you have the equipment? Are you prepared to move it? I know Mike just talked and that you own the equipment, but given the size of the rebound do you think you have, are you prepared for that size jump?","David L. Starling","I think there were like 5 questions in that string. We'll try to get them. Yes, let me -- let's say it this way. First of all, the crop is the crop and the demand is the demand. So the fact that we've got 2 new elevators on our system doesn't mean that our revenues and volumes and grain are going to increase disproportionately. Our business, as we've said in the past is really consumption-based. Most of the grain that we ship goes into food products, food production, either poultry or corn syrup, soft drinks, that type of thing. We've said in the past kind of jokingly that the official KCS luncheon is chicken tacos and diet soft drinks. So it's consumption-based. But those markets increase modestly. The 2 new elevators that we have, our customers did not build those elevators to retain just the business that they have. They are looking for growth. They're looking for new markets. They're looking for market share conversions. So we will get some incremental pickup as a result of those facilities being on our network. What it really does, one of the big advantages and strategic advantages of having those facilities on our network is it gives us more control over the originations and it gives us more geographic diversity to protect against or mitigate things like drought and flooding and that type of thing. And this is a silly thing to say, but if we had, had those 2 elevators last year, we would've had a much better business levels because, in this case, the areas that -- one in particular, in Western Illinois, the area that this new elevator is serving was less affected by drought than some of the other regions that we serve. So there are lots of strategic advantages to having these 2 new facilities. I will mention one of our customers just recently secured another -- a very large export contract for 2014. We have that contract today, but going forward, the 2014 volumes will represent about 5% or 6% increase in their shipments. And that's a nice cross-border move going from the elevators that we serve down into Central and deep into Mexico, down into Mexico City. I'll let Dave Ebbrecht talk about the capacity issues.","David R. Ebbrecht","Yes. As far as the capacity issues, there's a couple of things we did. One, we wanted to be able to turn all the sets we had quicker, reduce some of the cycle times. And with the originations coming out of these new plants, we're able to cut the cycle time days for the whole fleet, down a couple of days. That's one way we became more efficient with the fleet. The other thing I also mentioned, we kept from furlough, during the second and third quarter, personnel that were going to be specifically needed for the surge during the fourth quarter. So we're in very good shape from a human resource perspective, as far as people to be able to run the train. And lastly, on the fleet slide -- fleet side, what we did was create some storage contracts that enabled people with grain cars, excess grain cars, to store them on our facility in proximity to our locations needed. And then we would be able to have short-term contracts to use them as needed to surge during the fourth quarter, to accommodate any shortfalls that we may see in transit. So we are very well-positioned, capacity-wise, not only from an infrastructure perspective but from a railcar and people perspective to handle all the surge.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate that. And if I can do my follow-up then on autos. Similarly, you signed a bunch of contracts you're about to ramp up. Maybe can you give any sense to that timing of when the plant is launched, maybe on scale? And, I don't know if you throw that Manzanillo, the build into that? I don't know -- just to maybe give a perspective on the scale of the ramp-up on the autos, given the contracts and where everything pans out now.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Well, the 3 plants -- as I mentioned, the 3 plants that are opening here in the near term will represent about 600 -- I think the number is around 625,000 finished vehicles. Which is a pretty big increase overall. Just for Mexico: finished vehicles around 2 million; 1.9 million, 1.8 million, I think, last year. But obviously, those plants will ramp-up over a 1- or 2-year period. So we're not going to see a huge surge just because the capacity has been built. And ultimately, will be a function of auto sales, North American auto sales. So we're planning on -- and we will get business out of those plants beginning first quarter of next year. So we're certainly planning to see a stronger year next year in autos than we've seen certainly recently. But I don't know if that's -- to answer you, we're not going to get into details about the timing and specifics about volume growth. But certainly, the fact that those plants are going to be open and we will start moving vehicles in the first quarter of next year.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Allison Landry from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was hoping to dig into the incremental margins a little bit. You mentioned having held back some of the crews in anticipation of the return in grain volumes, plus it sounded like there is a little bit of expenses from the storms in Mexico, and I know that you don't exclude stuff like that, but I just wanted to get some color on what the incremental margins may have looked like, if you did exclude these items? And maybe the better question is, is it fair to assume that we'll see a return to something in the mid-50s range, in Q4 and possibly going forward?","Michael W. Upchurch","Yes, Allison, this is Mike. You're right, 44% is a little bit lower than what we've had in the past. But I think we've also always tried to maybe guide that 40% to 50% range as something that would be very acceptable to us in this business. But during the quarter, as I indicated, we did have a higher fuel cost, mainly driven by the increase in price in Mexico, which was up 14% year-over-year and that was about a $3 million negative lag in the quarter. So I'll let you do the math and assume how much of that might have improved the incremental margin percentage. And then I think on the hurricane, we don't want to make a big deal out of this. I think Dave indicated this is an outdoor sport business. We did have about $1 million of incremental costs and maybe some lost revenue there, but I don't think we want to sit here and make a lot of excuses for the quarter. I think 67.8% is still a pretty solid number.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you, now I totally understood. And my follow-up question on fuel. I noticed that the growth in consumption in terms of gallons was actually higher than volume growth? And it looks like we haven't seen this happen since the second quarter of 2011. So I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about what was going on here?","David R. Ebbrecht","Yes, I'll tell you, from an operating perspective, if you look at the second half of the quarter, what we saw were high coal shipments and high grain shipments, which consumed a lot of fuel on those unit trains. Also with the growth that we have out of L\u00e1zaro, that is one of our highest fuel consumption districts also for trains. So I think it was more of a mix issue of what we had volume-wise during the quarter. And then when you spread that over the manifest that we had, increased through Shreveport Jackson on the Meridian Speedway, we ran 132 extra trains during the quarter over our transportation service plan. Which, obviously, adds to the increased fuel.","Michael W. Upchurch","Just to pick up here and just to clarify one thing that Dave said about the increase out of Lazaro, he's talking about steel and other commodities, not necessarily Intermodal. We move other things out of L\u00e1zaro, so a lot of steel coming out of a plant there going north into Mexico, which does burn a lot of fuel.","David L. Starling","You're going up through the mountains, Allison, and coming out of L\u00e1zaro. It's our highest burn system, or part of the system, that we have.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and I guess, sort of along the same lines, with grain coming back quite strongly in the fourth quarter, should we be thinking about consumption above volume growth, once again, for 4Q?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Coal is going to be down. Grain will be up. I don't know exactly...","David L. Starling","It should be...","David R. Ebbrecht","I would say it's going to be relatively the same from what we saw in the third quarter. I don't see any increases.","David L. Starling","Good question, we haven't really looked at that.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Justin Long from Stephens Inc.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","In 2014, it looks like grain should be strengthening, auto should be getting better with the new plant. I would imagine both of these have a positive mix impact. Is it fair to say that the mix next year should be a tailwind? Or is there something on the horizon that would prevent that from being the case?","David L. Starling","Justin, are you calling from a rail yard?","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I think that's on your end, I don't know if we have too many trains around our area.","Unknown Executive","It must be Jos\u00e9.","David L. Starling","Yes, Jos\u00e9, is that you?","Jos\u00e9 L. Zozaya","Yes, that's me. We're in a train yard.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes, I think you're right. The mix should be a tailwind next year, with grain being strong. And the other thing I mentioned, I don't think I completely satisfied, Ken, I'll go back to the Auto story. I did make the misstatement: vehicle production mix goes $2.9 million not $1.9 million. So we've got 625,000 additional vehicle capacity coming on stream, with the 3 plants that are set to open. And again, as I said, that will ramp up. The one thing that I will also say about the mix and the auto business that we have secured with these new plants, we have secured more cross-border movements where the vast majority of our auto business, our finished vehicle business today is within intra-Mexico and interchanged at the border. The new plants, with the new business that we secured, we will see a noticeable increase in our cross-border movements which, obviously, has a longer length of haul, longer, higher RPU. So that should be a positive mix impact. There will be, of some kind.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And as a follow-up, I was wondering if there was any update on the new bulk terminal at L\u00e1zaro? Are you still having conversations on the export coal opportunity? And how are you thinking about the potential for that facility to ramp in 2014?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","We don't see anything happening there on export coal in 2014. Spreads are just too narrow, and we don't really -- we're talking to some people about export coal, but it's not through Mexico, or out of Lazaro. It will be through the U.S. Gulf Coast. But we don't have anything in our plan, or forecast, for 2014.","David L. Starling","There's still discussions about shipping coal to Europe. There've been some test burns, but I think it's like the Bakken right now. The spread is a little too wide and it just doesn't make sense right now. What we're being told, it will at some point. They think it will because of the high price of natural gas in Europe, but it hasn't happened yet.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Just as a little fun fact, though. The one thing that we do have with that pet coke export facility in Port Arthur is, we have a facility that is permitted, and has capacity to export pet coke and coal. So that could be a nice thing to have.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","When we look towards these growth opportunities in 2014, and then putting in context the OR expansion that you guys have gotten over the last 3 years, it's been close to 200 basis points a year, should that type of pace of improvement in the OR improve with the growth opportunities? Are you going to get even better leverage? I guess it kind of comes back to the earlier question on incremental margins. And does that picture look better in '14?","David L. Starling","This is Dave Starling. I think the position we've taken is we're going to continue to look for efficiencies in our network and we will continue to look for cost savings. And those should affect the OR in a positive way. But if you get a chance to on-board $300 million of business, and it moves the OR from a 66 to a 67 I'll take it. So OR is only one factor that we look at. We certainly -- it's an indicator, but we're also constantly looking at our margins, our revenue and our EPS. So that's just one part of the formula. And as you get down here in the mid-60s, we've got to be cautious here that our customers know that we're spending the right amount of capital and providing the right kind of service to justify the margins we're getting.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And you would view a mid-60s OR as a good hurdle rate for new business?","David L. Starling","No, I didn't say that. Every business case will stand on its own. And it will depend on whether we have locomotives, we have to go buy assets, do they furnish the cars, do we furnish the cars? Is this a long-term contract? Is it a short-term opportunity? You've got to look at each business case on its own. You don't -- we don't have just a rate we throw out there and say, \"This is our hurdle.\" So far I think we've made the right decisions in improving the margins we've had. I think the big thing that we're continuing to look at is that leverage that we have, and how we maintain that.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","We're going to be very careful about incremental capital investments, generating the right kind of return. And we set hurdles of upper teens. And I think if you look at the growth that we've been able to deliver versus the rest of the industry, and the improvement in margins and the improvement in ROIC, it certainly supports the capital that we've spent.","David L. Starling","You may have an opportunity on the branch line that's very underutilized, and you could get some unit trains on that line. That's manna from heaven. That's pure incremental margin. So you've got to look at it from a segment, and look at your whole network.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, maybe with my follow-up, if I can just ask it a little bit differently. Because I think the expectation here is that, with the new business, it's going to lever and quite nicely drive a little bit more margin expansion. Is there any sort of startup cost with these new facilities coming online, or, where it takes time to ramp up to get to full profitability on the new business? Or should we be thinking about it as pretty quick, as soon as these new opportunities start, you're going to see the possibilities?","David L. Starling","Well, with the capital investments we've been making on capacity, we certainly had been making those in anticipation of growth. So we look out 3 to 5 years. And if that changes, if Pat comes to us and says: \"The world's changed, you're not going to see this. It's shifting to another area.\" Then we will change our capital spend. And we're going to talk to you some in 2014 about our CapEx and what the additional spend in CapEx has done for us, for the company, from a margin standpoint. Because I think we've made the right decisions. Will we get to a point where we can start to ratchet the CapEx down, yes. I think we will. And it will be more activity-based on different projects than we might have to ratchet it up. But I think we're going to benefit, in the coming years, for the amount of CapEx we have spent to get our system robust, make sure we've got the assets and make sure we're ready for the volume. I think you've heard me say on this call several times, one thing I'm not going to be guilty of as CEO is somebody coming in with business, and we can't handle it. So we can't keep the business, we can't make a good margin on it, because we're inefficient. So we'll continue to keep -- we're a growth company, but we're going to continue to keep our capacity out ahead of our growth.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And if you -- I just want to add one thing. If you look at some of the larger -- particularly on the energy side, the larger new business opportunities, the CapEx that we're going to invest is largely locomotives. So we're not going to go out and acquire a huge locomotive fleet to support that business until it actually comes. On the auto side, it's more railcars. And in that case, it's supported by longer-term contracts.","David L. Starling","Did that answer your question?","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, it did, in great detail.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Scott Group from Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","I just want to follow-up on that discussion that we just had in terms of next year's outlook. As we start thinking about high single-digit growth coming through the network, just from a resource standpoint, I understand, Dave, you're talking earlier about you can add headcount less than volume growth. Is it reasonable to think about another year of like 1% to 2% kind of volume growth? Or, does that naturally just have to be a little bit higher, given the volumes that we expect? And then just from more of a capital and asset perspective, do you feel like you've got all the locomotives and cars that you need to handle the growth? And is there any kind of track projects that you feel like you need, like a Victoria Rosenberg coming up, given all the big growth that we expect? There's a bunch of odd questions in there, but all focused on resources and capital.","Michael W. Upchurch","Scott, and just to clarify, I think you meant 1% to 2% headcount growth, not volume growth?","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes, sorry about that.","David L. Starling","You're asking if we can still scale to that, with our growth?","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","Yes, that was one of the questions, yes.","David L. Starling","I'll let Dave take that one.","David R. Ebbrecht","Okay, as far as the resource areas, yes, we can still scale at very low headcount additions with the growth. But given that we know where the growth is coming, there are certain corridors that we will add headcount in, depending on where the growth materializes. We approach each of our subdivisions and look at that capacity and have 5-year plans for each one, and there are certain trigger events that we use to make sure that we have the just-in-time resources for that growth available. But largely, if you look at our network right now, we are not headcount-constrained in any area. But we will continue to hire to replace attrition in a lot of those areas and we will be low, around the 1% to 2% growth area, of what we see against all the plants for the next, at least 1 year, to even more than 2 years in the future. Given that, we'll stay with the growth opportunities that we have and in place. On the track side, we're largely working on our gateway improvements. We believe that a lot of our subdivisions have the capacity to handle the growth that we're projecting. But we'll start talking about major gateways such as the Laredo International Bridge, and looking at the accommodation of the growth through that corridor, where we want to significantly invest to improve our capacity to handle growth over multiple years to come in the future. So we have major projects going along those lines. And on the equipment side, I think Pat addressed it appropriately. We're not going to -- we can handle all the growth we have for next year on the projections right now, with the 35 locomotives we're getting in at the end of this year. And we will look at, towards the end of the year, whether we're properly postured for the fourth quarter through, at least, the second quarter of the upcoming year. So I think that from locomotives side, we're good and the car side, we will address them on customer-specific levels and the contracts that we have in place.","David L. Starling","We still got room in our Intermodal and Automotive trains. So we're still, as we've grown those, you're seeing the incremental side of it improve because we're still filling trains out.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research, LLC","That's all really helpful. Just with that view, then, is it fair to think about CapEx coming down next year?","David L. Starling","We're going to be meeting with the board in November and going through those plans. It's probably not going to be 26%. So if you ask me, could it come down? Yes, it possibly could. But again, we try to work off of a 5-year plan, and we do our car modeling and locomotive modeling and capacity modeling all based on 5-years. But the board, if the growth is there and the revenue is there, 25% CapEx is not a bad problem if you've got the growth coming with it. But we certainly aren't going to get out too far ahead of ourselves. When we get in some of these lanes, if we've got ample capacity, we'll start to meter it down a little bit. But we're getting in a mix now where we're kind of going to be in the norm with the other railroads in the leased versus owned, but we will be buying some cars as well. I mean, with all this growth, if you're going to be in a double-digit growth, you've got to have cars to load it in, so. We don't have that number yet. We'll be talking to you in the first quarter and we've got auto. I mean, with the autos coming on, we've got to look at some buy levels. And so, again, it's a good problem to have.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Thomas Kim from Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry to beat a dead horse, but just on this CapEx topic. What do you think your steady-state reinvestment rate should be over the long term? And you sort of alluded to bringing it down closer to your peer group level. So would it be 18%? And is that sort of a 5 year time horizon, or is that a 2020 sort of look that we should be thinking about?","David L. Starling","Tom, when I talked about our peers, I was talking about the ownership versus leased of equipments. We have traditionally been at about 80% leased and 20% owned. We're trying to ratchet that somewhere to around a 50-50 number, similar to the other roads. We think that's a reasonable number. We might take it down further, but it could be through new acquisition of new equipment rather than trying to convert existing leases. I don't know that there's a magic number right now for CapEx. That will be driven by the new business opportunities. And again, if it's crude, and they furnish all the cars, then we're just buying the locomotives. If that's something different, a steel train and we've got to buy the cars, then the CapEx will look different. So again, it's -- from our view right now, with the growth that we're enjoying, we don't see it as a problem, we see it as an opportunity. At some point, will it start to ratchet down? I'm sure it will. But where you'll see it first is in our basic network because we're, right now, at about 10%. I've talked about this in the past. 10% of our CapEx is maintenance. And as we've improved the system, you'll probably see that percentage drop down to 9% or 8%. But feeding -- fueling the growth is something we'll continue to do.","Michael W. Upchurch","Tom, this is Mike Upchurch. Let me make one comment here. If you go back to 2007 levels, we have grown volumes 121% of that. So if you indexed it all back. The rest of the industry is at 97%. So we have clearly outgrown the industry, and that's supportive of the capital investments that we've made. Also think, if you look at the incremental margins that we generated on that and the incremental return on invested capital, it would clearly support the amount of capital that we've spent. And to Dave's point, the last thing we want to do is not be ready to capture that growth opportunity. So I think you ought to continue to expect us to be above those 17%, 18% industry levels. And at some point, if that growth opportunity isn't there, we'll peel the capital back, but I think we've clearly demonstrated we can grow volumes faster than the industry, improve margins better than the industry and improve return on invested capital better than the industry.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could just ask another question with regard to Mexico, is it a foregone conclusion that the Honda, Mazda plants are opening up or commencing operations, will be feeding all on the KCSM line? And if not, what do you sort of envision the mix of things, split between yourselves and Ferromex?","David R. Ebbrecht","Well, it's different for each plant. We're not going to get it all. Certainly, we feel good about the share that we got. I'm not going to tell you exactly how much we got, but we feel good about the share that we got and we also feel good about the fact that we're going to be able to move some of these vehicles further on to our network in the U.S.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jason Seidl from Cowen & Company.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Listen, if you have the growth, and you can keep posting good results, I think everyone wants you investing your network. So I'm not going to be too concerned with the level of CapEx going forward here. I do have some questions in terms of the impact on the really strong grain harvest. You guys said sort of record-ever numbers. If I go back, that implies well above of 70% growth number for the volume side. One, am I sort of looking in the right direction on this? And two, were the impacts on your yield, your average revenue per carload, and I'm going to assume a lot of this stuff is going to get exported?","Michael W. Upchurch","I think this is one case, Jason, where looking in the rearview mirror might be helpful. If you go back to 2011, and I think that would be kind of a good benchmark for what we expect in the grain business for the next few quarters. 2011 -- first quarter of 2012 was unusually strong. I doubt -- I don't think we feel that we can necessarily hit that level. But 2011 was kind of the last really normal year for grain and for cross-border grain, so that's probably a good place to start. And yes, the average -- revenue per car and the yields on cross-border movements, particularly, when you look at the new Jacksonville facility -- Jacksonville, Illinois, which is kind of at the outermost reach of our network on the east side to Mexico City is a very, very, very nice long-haul for us. And the revenue per car in that business is going to be very attractive.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, so we should see sequentially from 3Q, all things being equal, your -- tick up noticeably in grain?","Michael W. Upchurch","Yes. What we saw in the third quarter, with the surge that we did get, was actually coming out of the Mississippi, Louisiana. So the revenue per car was lower than it normally would be when we're moving out of Kansas City, or Eastern Illinois -- Western Illinois.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. My follow-up question is just a nitpick in modeling at this point. Mike, you said you're going to end up at about 35.5% tax rate. So that would imply that 4Q is going to see a tax rate go up noticeably from 3Q?","Michael W. Upchurch","Well, I think the 3Q was 34.7%. So I don't know about noticeably.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Keith Schoonmaker from Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm interested in your thoughts concerning Mexican energy reform, potential volume benefits. I know it's early and uncertain, but I bet you've thought about it a little bit. And second, I think, Dave, maybe it was you on one of these calls, who pointed out the apparent disparity between rig count, north and south of the border, maybe, as the crow flies looking down. But what did you expect under a significant shift in ownership rights maybe comparable to other nations?","David L. Starling","Well, Jos\u00e9 has been patiently waiting down there in Mexico for a call, so I'm going to -- I don't want him to feel left out, so I'll let Jos\u00e9 take this one. I will comment first, though, before Jos\u00e9 answers. That rig count was really Pat, and it was a photo taken out of an airplane flying over the Rio Grande and looking down on the well sites on the U.S. side and no well sites on the Mexican side. So that's still the case, we still think it's a great opportunity. And Jos\u00e9 is keeping us posted on what the energy reform, what's happening and how it might affect us. But, Jos\u00e9, go ahead, please.","Jos\u00e9 L. Zozaya","Yes, thank you, Dave. Well, as you all know, Pe\u00f1a Nieto's party has proposed reform saying to help in pay mix to boost production. The proposal will of course maintain the state control over the company, but also allowed to enter into profit-sharing contracts with private companies. If the reforms are successful, and we think they will be -- just as we speak, the tax reform has been debating on the deputy's chamber last night. And part of that reform is that comes out today, which is expected from that chamber and both to the Senators' chamber is part of the deal is that, once approved, is that the Leftist party, will support the energy reform with the PRI. So there's a general consensus among Mexico's major parties, but many particulars needs to be worked out, there are some opposition of this still. We hope by 2014, Mexico can begin to move forward with some plans to expand its energy resources. The next few months, of course, are key and if we are going to see real progress, it is going to be in 2014 and 2015. Also, it is still early. We are optimistic that several reforms will result to opportunities to us to increase our business. And we do believe that we'll be growing opportunities to move frac sand, fuel oil, crude oil and LPG. I think those are the most important reference I can make at this moment.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Maybe a quick follow-up. I noticed in today's cash flow statement is the much larger purchased equipment under operating lease disclosed in your remark. It sounds like you're actively negotiating more of this. Based on progress so far, do you expect this to escalate, maybe be completed within a couple of years? And also, is the impact -- and I know there are a lot of moving lines here, but is the impact something like 200 basis points on OR, or is it smaller than that?","Michael W. Upchurch","Well, as you can probably appreciate, the negotiations are very active and it remains to be seen how successful we are and able to acquire a lot of that equipment on a short-term basis. I think we've consistently said the gap that we have in the mix of leased to owned equipment is probably a 5-plus year timeframe for us. And we'll certainly keep people posted on the success that we have. We have -- over the last few years, purchased about $300 million off of lease and hopefully, we can continue to make that kind of a progress. But it's just very difficult whether lessors are interested in selling you the equipment, and then at the price that makes economic sense to us.","David L. Starling","And on a go-forward basis, you'll see us much more inclined to purchase than lease. And that will move the needle over time.","Operator","Our final question today is coming from Anthony Gallo from Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So back at Auto, you mentioned that you were able secure some of the U.S. moves to the Mexican auto production growth. Has all of that available business been awarded? And if not, can you speak to your network's advantages or disadvantages as it relates to winning, maybe, some additional business?","David R. Ebbrecht","As far as I know, all of the expected volume has been awarded. If not -- that's not the case, necessarily, at Nissan. So the answer is, no, not all of it. Honda, Mazda, I think their awards are pretty complete. And again, keep in mind that we don't actually physically touch the Mazda plant. We have relied on an interchange there, but we did get a very nice award out of that. And the advantages of our network are, the way we orient the physical location of those plants to the markets that those vehicles really want to go in to, which is the Eastern United States and Canada, the big population centers over Laredo. That's the best route. And I think what the auto companies see is that our network, while we don't get to those places, Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte, the East Coast, the Mid-Atlantic, we have very effective connections with carriers who do. And so they see that we can give them options over Kansas City, Houston, if you look at the Jackson Meridian, New Orleans, as kind of a gateway to those markets, we can give them options with other carriers to get to any of the markets in the eastern half of North America that they want to get to. So that gives us a definite advantage.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then as a follow-up, does the use of any of these new auto railers have any influence on the profitability of this new business versus the existing book of auto business?","David R. Ebbrecht","The revenue per unit on some of the AutoMax -- you're talking about the AutoMax and the other articulated vehicles, yes? There are some advantages. They're flexible. There are some security advantages in Mexico. It's a more difficult car to break into. And so there are some unique features and advantages and some of the carriers really like that car type.","David L. Starling","The other part of your question, do we have to give up margin on those cars? The answer is, no.","Operator","We have reached the end of our Q&A session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.","David L. Starling","Okay. Thanks, everyone, on the call this morning. We appreciate the amount of interest that everyone is showing in KCS and it's TGIF, have a nice weekend. And we'll talk to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks, everyone.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company which could materially differ from the events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP could be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, please go ahead.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call.","I'll start with just a brief comment on Slide 4, introduction of today's presenters and I think you are very familiar with most of us. I will acknowledge the addition of Mike Naatz, as of October 1, Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer.","Draw your attention I think most of you saw the press release on September 10 announcing the change in our lineup here with Mike coming over to the Chief Marketing Officer role and Brian Hancock moving into the job of really previously held by Mike with a rebranding of the Executive Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer, happy to talk about that in the Q&A section.","For purposes of today's discussion and presentation Brian will handle all of the sales and marketing commentary on the call today since he was in that job for the entire third quarter but you will be hearing more from Mike going forward.","Moving to Slide 5, just a quick recap of the results for the quarter. We had record revenues for any quarter and in the third quarter of this year with an increase of 6% over last year on 4% volume growth. Brian, will talk about some of the growth drivers in his commentary, but we saw a number of our oversize growth opportunities continue to hit full stride in the quarter and feel very good about the condition of the business in a number of those areas.","Third quarter operating ratio reported of 62.0%. Adjusting for some items specifically, the flood recovery in the third quarter from Hurricane Harvey last year, which Mike Upchurch will cover in more detail, our operating ratio was 63.4%, which was an improvement of a full point over last year.","Third quarter earnings per share reported of $1.70, again adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.57 which was an increase of 16% from the prior year. Now this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. I think most of you have done the math and have concluded that our volume guidance that we have given in the second quarter of mid-single digits is going to be hard to achieve based on our - I think the guidance we gave was 3% to 4% at the end of the second quarter. Given our results for the third quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year, we are now shifting that to low single digit year-over-year volume growth for the full-year of 2018.","And I'll remind you that a couple of important drivers to our revenue guidance been brought down over the course of the year was the delay in the start up of some crude oil moves that we thought was going to start maybe as early as the first quarter of this year, which didn't materialize until much later. But it is moving and contributing to our growth from this point forward.","And then the second factor was service related issues, which, Jeff will get into in some detail here that have cost us some opportunities to grow in the second and third quarter.","So, if you look at this on the surface it's hard to feel bad about our performance record revenues, operating ratio improvement of 1% over the last year on an adjusted basis and earnings per share growth of 16% year-over-year but our performance this quarter did not meet our own expectations and some of the expectations that we articulated earlier in the year, we will get better. Our service issues, we're seeing improvement. Everyday we're getting a little better, the inventories and metrics are improving.","And Jeff will get into that in greater detail. And I'll turn the mic over to Jeff right now. Thank you.","Jeffrey Songer","Okay. Thank you, Pat. Good morning.","Starting with review of operating metrics for the quarter on Slide 7, overall velocity in Dwell saw a significant impacts related to congestion in our border region. While Houston congestion eased at the start of the quarter, we were not able to work off the backlog of traffic that built in Mexico during that time which led to elevated volumes entering peak season.","This residual excess inventory accompanied by substantial year-over-year growth in cross-border traffic of 13% and 20% in quarters two and three respectively, strained our operation in the region. Excessive Dwell in our Monterrey and Sanchez terminals was the most pronounced during the quarter.","Expanding upon these terminals, Monterrey is a high-volume terminal with significant local daily switching demand across the large number of customers. Elevated inventories have been slow to work off due to the inherent complexity of this operation. Our long-term operating plan for this area is to move some of the switching activity for Monterrey into Sanchez, where we will be able to handle the increasing volumes more efficiently.","We also experienced some growing pains this quarter associated with the new Sanchez yard switching operation, a newly expanded mechanical work at the facility.","As congestion eases we should continue to gain efficiencies from our investment in Sanchez and our continued work with cross-border, customs, and international crew processes. Estimated cost due to the congestion of approximately $7 million during the quarter related primarily to increased equipment cost, labor and overtime.","Turning to Slide 8. Expanding on service recovery efforts, this chart reflects our Mexico cars online trend over the past several months. As indicated in earlier comments, events earlier in the year led to significant inventories primarily in Northern Mexico. However as shown here the total number of cars online in Mexico has reduced significantly from peak levels.","Network velocity has shown steady improvement over the past few weeks and Dwell has moderated from highs as we saw in the early September timeframe.","Additional actions taken to restore service include adding resources to Northern Mexico. We are leasing 30 additional locomotives in the short-term and have temporarily relocated crews into the region. We have implemented some new service plans and moderate terminal and work with the largest customers to right-size some of their equipment.","We continue to work constructively with our interchange partners to ensure system fluidity. While we will see pressure on performance metrics in Q4 as we continue to work down overall inventories, we believe these metrics are heading in the right direction and we expect to see more normalized levels in the next few weeks.","Other comments for the quarter included an update on PTC. I'm happy to announce that all of our PTC required subdivisions are in revenue service and we are turning our focus towards interoperability. I want to recognize the entire team for their outstanding work with PTC which has had very little operational impact during the past 12 months of revenue service implementation.","Additionally as mentioned last quarter, we are on pace to start receiving the first of 15 new locomotives in January. While this will provide an overall enhancement to our road fleet with more reliable, more fuel-efficient units, we continue to right-size overall fleet with a disposition of 33 low horsepower and switching units.","While it has been a challenging quarter, I believe our management team recent and ongoing investments, continued process improvements, relationships with interchange partners all remain healthy and position us to capitalize on our unique franchise moving forward.","I'll now turn the presentation over to Brian.","Brian Hancock","Thank you, Jeff and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll start my comments on Page 10 where you can see third quarter year-over-year revenue was up 6% on a 4% volume growth despite continued headwinds from the closure of large utility customer facility in Texas.","In the third quarter, we continue to see strong growth in cross-border carloads and revenue benefiting from key areas such as refined products, automotive and cross-border intermodal.","However as Jeff discussed during the quarter, we also experienced congestion in the North Mexico region of our network. They partially offset some of the expected year-over-year volume benefit from Hurricane Harvey in Q3 of 2017.","During the quarter, our revenue per unit grew 2% despite mixed pressure from the loss of the long haul utility coal business and unfavorable FX impact. Core pricing came in at 3.7% benefiting from an acceleration in contract renewal rates secured during the first half of 2018 when most of our renewal activity occurs.","The Chemical and Petroleum business unit grew - revenue growth of 17% was primarily driven by petroleum and plastics with both units benefiting from favorable comps due to Hurricane Harvey. Additionally petroleum revenue grew 36% driven by strength in our southbound volumes of refined products related to Mexico energy reform.","In Q3 Mexican energy reform carloads and revenue grew 164% and 123% respectively and we included an update on this important and growing business segment in our appendix. Revenue from our industrial and consumer business unit was flat year-over-year. This business unit benefited from strong forest products and appliance revenues due to the tightening truck capacity and increase brown paper demand but was offset by lower metals revenue where length of haul and volumes were negatively impacted by a shift in customer sourcing trends. This segment was also negatively impacted by the previously mentioned congestion at the border.","Another segment that was impacted by the congestion was our agricultural and mineral business. In this segment revenue was flat year-over-year with growth in revenue per unit offsetting volume declines. Our food products continued to be impacted by shifts and sourcing in a temporary customer plant outage.","Similar to last quarter, energies revenue decline of 2% was driven by a previously announced closure of a power generation facility in Texas and by frac sand sourcing changes. These declines were partially offset by higher volume and pricing in our crude oil business driven by increased production in Canada with increased rail utilization.","Intermodal revenue increased 8% with mixed performance by lanes both U.S., domestic and cross-border businesses saw solid performance as we continue to benefit from truck conversion as well as favorable comps from Q3 2017.","Similar to last quarter, this growth was partially offset by a 9% year-over-year decline in Lazaro intermodal volume. As I'll discuss on Slide 12, we are seeing some early positive signs from the actions we have taken to restore our Lazaro Cardenas volumes.","Revenue from our automotive business was up 8% over prior year volumes increased due to higher carryover inventory an increase in plant production, an increase in Lazaro Cardenas import volumes and favorable comps due to the 2017 Hurricane Harvey interruptions. Our business also saw a negative impact from border congestion and continued industry network congestion that resulted in equipment availability issues in North America.","On Slide 11 and in support of Jeff\u2019s comments regarding congestion at the border we wanted to provide a perspective on the increase of volume in our cross-border business. As you can see year-over-year cross-border volume increased 20% in the third quarter.","Over the last few years, our mix of shipments has shifted away from our domestic coal and more towards cross-border refined products, automotive and intermodal business. We\u2019ll continue to see these changes impact our business over the next few years.","Now to Slide 12 where, we provide an outlook for the fourth quarter of 2018 for each of the business segments. As Pat mentioned our full-year volume outlook is for low single-digit year-over-year growth. Overall demand continues robust and we're working with our customers to create innovative solutions for their growing future needs.","Starting with chemical and petroleum Mexico energy reform continues to be a significant focus and unique opportunity for KCS. We expect volume growth from refined products to continue at an accelerated pace for the next few years.","As additional storage capacity comes online additionally we expect plastics to grow in the second half of 2018 due to increase demand. We also expect to see continuing solid growth in intermodal cross-border in US domestic lanes.","As we discussed last quarter, we are closely monitoring our Lazaro Cardenas volumes and are seeing early positive trends during the peak season as additional trucking regulations are implemented in Mexico. And as our customers continue to evaluate and take advantage of the short-term volume-based pricing strategy. Significant congestion at the port of Manzanillo is also helping to bolster our Lazaro volumes.","We will see solid performance in our automotive business would grow slightly ahead of most third-party estimates from Mexico production. In addition to increasing production in Mexico our growth may benefit from market share gains with some of our biggest customers. As congestion eases the new equipment and new equipment continues to come online we expect to see continued growth in our automotive business.","Our industrial and consumer business unit should continue to benefit from strong demand and tight truck capacity particularly in the paper and appliance business. However, our metal segment will continue to see unfavorable impacts of shifts and sourcing strategies and trade developments. This segment will also see the largest benefits as congestion eases and a normal operating environment returns in Northern Mexico.","We expect our Ag and Min volumes to be slightly up in Q4 with steady demand in both grain and food products as well as easing in the North Mexico congestion. Our energy business will be down during the fourth quarter as it continues to be impacted by the closing of the facility in Texas and as changes in frac sand sourcing continue. However, we do expect continued growth in Canadian crude with volume similar to the level that we moved in Q3 as well as a short-term opportunity in the Permian Basin crude.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Michael Upchurch","Thanks Brian, and good morning.","I\u2019ll start my comments on Slide 14. Third quarter of 2018 revenues were 699 million growing 6% over the third quarter of 2017. With appreciating peso negatively impacted revenue by 10 million while fuel surcharge revenues increased 25 million over the third quarter of 2017.","Reported operating ratio of 62% represents a 240 basis point improvement over third quarter 2017. Included in the third quarter of 2018 reported operating ratio is a $9.4 million gain on a partial settlement of our Hurricane Harvey claim that impacted us during the third quarter of 2017.","Adjusted operating ratio improved 100 basis points despite a challenging operating environment that added approximately $7 million in extra expense due to network congestion. Incremental margins excluding the insurance gain were approximately 50%.","Reported EPS was $1.70 a 38% increase over third quarter of 2017. On an adjusted basis EPS was a $1.57 and increase of 16% over the third quarter of 2017. Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29% one percentage point lower than our guidance of 30. We now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 29% for the year 2018 and into 2019. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to a reduction or guilty tax expense as the Treasury Department has indicated new regulations, fixing the foreign tax credit issues forthcoming in the next few weeks that will partially remediate the negative implication of the guilty tax to KCS.","During the quarter we also reported a $16.6 million, our one-time tax benefit due primarily to a reduction to the provisional repatriation liability we recorded at the end of 2017, that resulted from new interpretations and treasury department regulations issued during the third quarter. They clarified the amount of repatriation tax due. As the nature of the benefit is one-time only, we recorded this as a credit in adjustment to EPS to reported EPS. A complete reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS is on Page 24 in the appendix.","Finally, average outstanding shares for the third quarter were $102.1 million, lower than the $104.7 million average outstanding shares for the third quarter a year ago. The reduction in shares outstanding is reflective of repurchasing our common stock. Additional details on our income statement are included in Slide 23 in the appendix.","Moving to Slide 15, adjusted operating expenses, which excludes the $9.4 million gain we recorded in the third quarter on the partial settlement of hurricane Harvey damages increased 5%. Fuel prices increased $16 million, network congestion drove $7 million of incremental expense in the quarter. Depreciation increased $6 million primarily from PTC in servicing. Wage inflation and increased headcount contributed to $6 million of year-over-year expenses, and offsetting these increases were lower incentive compensation of $11 million and FX impacts of $7 million.","Turning to Slide 16, compensation and benefits expense decreased 4 percentage points, largely the result of year-over-year declines in incentive compensation expense of $11 million. Partially offsetting that decline was wage inflation and a 1% increase in FTE, combining for a $6 million increase in comp and benefits expense.","Network congestion also increased our compensation and benefits expense by approximately $2 million due to higher crude costs and overtime. Finally, FX reduced compensation expenses by $2 million.","Turning to Slide 17, fuel expense, net of IFs increased 17% due to an increase in fuel prices in the U.S. by 30% and in Mexico by 13%. Foreign exchange contributed to a $3 million reduction in fuel expense.","Turning to Slide 18. Equipment expenses increased $2 million or 7%. Network congestion contributed to an incremental $4 million of car hire expense in the quarter. Partially offsetting the car higher increases are continued lower equipment lease expenses of $2 million. Purchased services increased $7 million or 14%. Repairs and maintenance on equipment increased $4 million due to lower billings to other equipment owners that are generally recorded as credits. Partially offsetting that repair and maintenance billings were savings and the materials and other line item. And again, network congestion caused us to detour some traffic to other rail partners, which increased expenses by $1 million.","And turning to Slide 19. We continue to believe our best use of capital is to invest in our growth opportunities. For 2018, we're now projecting capital to be on the lower end of our $530 million to $550 million guidance. This will be the third year in a row of reduced CapEx in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue.","While our capital budget for 2019 has not been finalized, we do currently expect to see an increase in capital due to the purchase of 50 new locomotives. Excluding the locomotive purchases, the remainder of our CapEx is expected to be flat to slightly down from 2018 levels. We also continue to evaluate investments in growth opportunities particularly in Mexico, as the refined product market continues to show very promising growth.","During the quarter we repurchased 472,000 shares of our common stock, and have now completed approximately $420 million of the $800 million share repurchase program approved by our Board in August of 2017. Combined with dividends of last year, we have provided our shareholders well over a $0.5 billion in return to capital.","Finally, we continue to be very comfortable with our capital structure. We now own 77% of our equipment stemming from our seven-year effort to purchase leased equipment. During this time we have purchased over $1 billion of leased equipment resulting in an approximate 250 basis point improvement in OR, and an approximate $40 million improvement in cash and net P&L benefit. We expect to enjoy an industry - we continue to enjoy and industry best weighted average interest rate of 3.96%, and have credit metrics that are better than the peer group.","And with that I'll turn the call back over to Pat.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you, Mike.","All right, I'll close with just a few comments here and then open up for questions. First, I'd like to say our core business continues to be strong. As Brian said in his comments, demand across most of our business units is robust. Economic outlook is positive in both the U.S. and Mexico, and we are seeing and realizing some of the oversized growth opportunities that we've been talking about for the last few quarters, specifically the growth in refined products and continued growth in intermodal and automotive.","Secondly, at this moment our service is not meeting our customers nor our own expectations, and our operational efficiency is not where it needs to be to handle all of the growth that we see in front of us. We will get better. Jeff, talked in his comments about the recent trends, the assets, the resources that we're putting on this problem.","Mike, mentioned the 50 new locomotives that we're buying and that we will take delivery of in 2019. And I have tremendous confidence in the team, they're focused, they're working very, very hard to get us through this and get us on our feet. And we are getting better almost every day, and I think we can see with the trends - recent trends that that we are improving.","Don't lose sight of the fact of Slide 11 that Brian showed. We've had really exceptional growth in cross-border volumes in revenues for the last two quarters. So, some of this congestion is a function of the growth that we're experiencing at the border. And again, I'll just reiterate, we will get this fixed and we will get better.","Third, some of the so-called storm clouds that have created uncertainty and darkened our skies for the last a couple of years are dissipating. The renegotiation of NAFTA and the signing of the new U.S. MCA still have some work to do there with congressional approvals in all three countries. But based on what we have seen it looks like a good agreement, some things that need to be worked through and I'll say that most specifically the steel and aluminum tariffs that have not yet been removed and released probably is the biggest question and obstacle to the congressional approval process. But very confident that that will move forward and remove that uncertainty.","Certainly the presence of an agreement with the three countries is a very good thing and we happen to think this agreement is also a good outcome. And then the transition in the Mexican election, I look back on my comments at the end of the second quarter don't really have too much more to say. We continue to be pleased by the messaging that is coming out of the new administration.","We continue to engage with new government officials as we get closer to the December 1st transition date. And again, most of the messaging, most of the signals that we've gotten are positives and encouraging that we will not see any major shift in either foreign relations or economic policy in Mexico. So, we think at this point that that all looks to be significantly less of a risk and uncertainty than it that was in the past.","And then finally just close with our long-term growth fundamentals remain very strong, we feel very confident, we have good visibility in some of the oversized growth areas that we've talked about refined products, plastics, intermodal and automotive and feel that those fundamentals have remained unchanged and very strong for the years ahead.","And with that, I will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","So there hasn't really been too much attention on KSU from a precision railroading perspective. So I just wanted to understand is that something you're thinking about or are there may be elements that you're considering given some of the congestion you\u2019re experiencing. Just wanted to sort of understand or maybe if you could outline to us some other reasons why it would work or conversely would not work. So would like to get thoughts on that?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes Allison yes absolutely there certainly are elements of the precision schedule railroading methodology that we think makes sense. A lot of these fallback to things like lean processes, trip plan compliance, more adherence to trip plans, improved asset utilization, discipline. We are working through all of those things on an ongoing basis and we think they can be helpful to getting us through the service issues and the congestion issues we\u2019re experiencing now.","We're also paying very close attention to what's going on with our interchange partner Union Pacific. Obviously they are implementing their own version of precision schedule railroading with the unified 2020 plan. The magnitude and degree of our interchange with UP is really going to dictate that we cooperate and in some cases probably follow their lead on some changes in their operating philosophy.","And again we\u2019re staying very close to that if it make sense if their elements of the plan that we think can improve our efficiency and certainly our interchange with UP. We\u2019re going to be very open-minded to adopting and integrating those principles.","Allison Landry","Okay.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I don't Jeff if you anything more to add.","Jeffrey Songer","Yes, so Pat touched on a couple of those keys really if you look at the congestion now its inventory. And so you know certainly asset utilization turning those cars faster, working constructively with customers to kind of right-size fleets if you will, for me that's there is certainly an opportunity for us in that one specific area as well as the other. We are looking across the Board we have seen some good efforts over the last couple years with fuel efficiencies really focusing in on labor productivity.","Volume this quarter of 4% on labor of 1% increase there is some efficiencies being gained there but I think we can certainly go farther. And we\u2019re certainly looking and working as Pat mentioned with interchange partners to understand how that may impact us, understand how that might shift some of our own schedules and kind of lean things up to be honest.","Allison Landry","And then is there anything with like the Mexico, the labor agreements in Mexico or the border crossing that would be - prevent you guys from implementing this in terms of the cross border or the Mexico business?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","No, nothing unique to Mexico. We\u2019ve talked in the past about elongated hiring times, but there is looking to just right-size and simplify our network a bit, but there's nothing inherent to Mexico that should be any different as to how we look at that in U.S.","Allison Landry","And then just really quickly in terms of the cross-border volume growth in Q3. How much do you think that the car cycle times and whatnot hurt growth and it is that something we should expect you to persist in Q4?","Brian Hancock","Yes Allison, this is Brian. I would say that certainly the longer cycle times did impact us during the quarter. Over the last few weeks we've been getting much better and I would tell you much of the focus that we have with Jeff's team is just making sure that we have the correct priority as we start to turn these cars specifically in refined products, grain and automotive those are the big three where car turn and utilization is extremely important.","And I would say that we've been in lockstep with our customers as we gotten through this congestion, but it\u2019s certainly critical but I think that we\u2019re certainly starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel and we feel like that's certainly going to be a key thing for us to focus on the future.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Just a quick reminder headline growth on cross-border for volume and revenue was a little bit better given the fact that we had the hurricane in 2017.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead with your questions.","Tom Wadewitz","So I wanted to ask you question on the capacity in the operating side it seems like you made a good investment over time to position yourself to handle growth and you've been optimistic on seeing that growth come in. But yet you seem to run into some of these issues with congestion, the system and so forth whether it said that cross-border points sure did the Northern Mexico terminal.","So I just wanted to see if you could give a sense of what gives you confident in 2019 that you be able to handle some of the growth that may come on if there are things that are different - just how you would look at that - how you would - what would give you confidence that you can handle the growth that may come on in 2019?","Jeffrey Songer","Yes Tom, this is Jeff. So if we look at investments in cross-border, Sanchez's is a great new facility for us it's added a lot of capacity. The slide I really again as I mentioned the indicator for me this quarter has been the volume and that slide - the graph I showed on Slide 8 eight there, I don't want to dredge back in the Hurricane Harvey, but I wanted to show kind of the trends in total inventories online and how that's grown over the past several months.","And so jumping off into peak season with the impacts we've seen for good part of the year some of those in our control some of those out of control has just really led to an elevated view jumping off point if you will into peak. And then compounding that with the cross-border growth we've seen just created additional demand.","And so starting off the network with Monterrey getting clean, with Sanchez getting clean we really haven't been able to do what we wanted to do in Sanchez yet which is relieve some of the pressure and some of the volumes out of Monterrey.","So as this congestion gets more clean we\u2019ll start seeing those operating shifts and our operating plan shifts to utilize new and more efficient capacities in Sanchez specifically. We have international crews thus far we\u2019re running maybe three, four trains a day with international crews. We\u2019ve got five crews certified by the end of November we\u2019re targeting to have another five certified. So that will continue to add capacity there at the bridge. We've got some new higher horsepower locomotives as we mentioned coming on here starting in January.","And we continue to work with our interchange partner specifically UP on efficiencies at Laredo also looking at the Matamoros gateway how we can expand and continue to utilize that for additional cross-border volume.","So I\u2019m comfortable that capacity there. As Mike mentioned, we\u2019re still going to have a healthy CapEx for next year and we\u2019re still focusing on these key areas to continue to add capacity with that. That coupled with some of the simplification and some of lean concepts that we\u2019re working on.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I'll just chime in and go back and take a look at that slide that Jeff mentioned and just look at that trend from April to September. I mean this is an issue that has been building really for six months and its going to take a while to get through it. And we\u2019re getting better every day as I mentioned and when we get through it and began to see the benefit of some of the clearing out of the yards and then some of the capacity that we've added.","We've continued to add capacity at Sanchez every year very confident that we'll be able to handle the growth that we see for 2019 and beyond. The addition of the locomotives obviously will help as well.","Tom Wadewitz","What about the idea that or the risk that you don't control your destiny how you run, but you are affected a lot by UP. I guess on the Monterrey yard comment local traffic you\u2019re affected by customer action as well. So how much of fact do you think those two things kind of add the flow from UP and getting customers to change behavior. How much of the improvement is dependent on those two things?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","From a customer view, I think again, I think we've learned a little bit coming out of congestion here working with our largest customers there to really try to right size some of the equipment. We probably hold a little too much equipment for some of our main customers, but working with them to right size equipment. We are also obviously partnering or working with customers as well on capacity in their own terminals.","You look at the Monterrey industry in general, and it's aged, there's probably not the capacity in general around the Monterrey area for lot of customers, but we're actively right now working in partnering ship with looking at their own terminals and how we collectively add capacity to the area. So that's certainly one positive, and if I want to take a little bit of positive away from the congestion some of the learnings and takeaways and really partnering and working more closely with the customers that certainly ongoing right now.","UP obviously it's a very important interchange partner for us. We continue to work constructively with them. As I say, they're working with us on international crews in their own right, helping and assisting and working jointly with customs processes at Laredo. And as I mentioned, for me the Matamoros Brownsville gateway remains important and we're only crossing four to five trains there a day. And so there's no reason that can have a similar capacity that we got at Laredo.","So, I think all the above \u2013 I think it's healthy, I think the relationships and the interchange partners is all healthy, and I think it's mutually beneficial. A lot of that traffic still a greater portion of the traffic over Laredo was UP, so there is no reason they don't want to continue to partner and work with us to get better.","Jeffrey Songer","I think that's really an important thing \u2013 to emphasize is that these are joint customers. So they're equally important to our interchange partner in the north as they are to us and then just circle back on the Matamoros, so that there is a little more emphasis on that. Matamoros Brownsville historically has always been, and I'll use a word that Lance Fritz actually used, a bleed valve, it's been sort of a safety valve when things get congested. We use it to reroute traffic to reduce congestion at the border.","We are now engaged with UP to look at that more strategically. The problem with the bleed valve strategy is, you don't build capacity for a longer term you tend to have higher cost. It's something that comes and goes it's used on an interim basis and frequently kind of in emergency circumstances. When we look at the growth that we have coming out of the Gulf, take refined products as a great example but it could also play into grain and automotive and other things.","We're going to need to completely rethink how we use that Brownsville Matamoros gateway it's going to be a longer term strategic part of the network for both of us. We need to make sure we've got the resources and the capacity. We're going to spend money over the next three or four years on what we call the F-line, which is the route between Monterrey and Matamoros to make sure that it's up to the standard and has the capacity for the growth that we see. And that longer term I think will create a lot of efficiencies for both of us in the way we handle cross border traffic.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I had mentioned one other thing, and we don't talk a lot about FXE, but there is a project ongoing with FXE constructing a bypass around Monterrey. So as well as we work with other interchange partners, we're doing the same in Mexico. That will give us the ability to reroute trains kind of out and away from like in the most congested areas of Monterrey,","So, we look for that by pass to be complete toward the end of next year. So, I think all railroads are focused on, and all railroads will continue to focus on the capacity side of things as well as the process improvement side.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Wanted to start on the volume side and just may be get some perspective from you maybe not so much about 2018, and how you think about how the fourth quarter lays out based on the guidance we kind of can\u2019t get there? I guess as I look out into 2019, wanted to get a sense you have the coal issues potentially being lapping \u2013 lap so is that something we should expect to continue to be a drain on 2019? And then can you maybe talk a little bit specifically about how the refined products opportunity might ramp up next year down but we have a few of these facilities now online. You have smart origination points on the Gulf Coast? I just wanted to get sense maybe like early look or maybe how things shape up for 2019?","Brian Hancock","This is Brian. First off what I would say is when you think about refined products, that is certainly where a significant amount of our focus is. If you think about the facilities that are coming online, it's not that the facilities is coming online, it is the tank storage that's coming online. And so you've already seen some increases there in the San Jose Iturbide area, you'll see two additional tanks there. Then at our facility in San Luis Potosi, those will come online in the first quarter.","So, we feel very comfortable that in those two particular spaces we'll have the additional storage. There was also some construction that began earlier this year in the Salinas Victoria area. Those will come on in the third quarter and that'll be storage for the Monterrey area. So again, I think overall we feel very comfortable that 2019 is going to continue to be a year where volumes will be strong and we'll continue to work. And it's important for us to work with every single one of these groups to make sure that the loading and unloading capacity is there so we can do it quickly.","Again, utilization of cars is a critical piece. When you think about the other pieces of the business I would say we're going to continue to see strong shift in there. It's a very strong economy down in Mexico. So each one of our business units is finding success in their own right, but I would tell you we're going to continue to see increases and volume increases as we move forward.","Michael Upchurch","Chris, this is Mike. Specific to your coal question, that has impacted our carloads and revenue by approximately three percentage points this year. And we can't wait to get to January 1, and lapse that negative comp.","Chris Wetherbee","And then maybe just thinking on the cost side Mike, you mentioned the incremental margins in the third quarter which were quite good. I know there are some \u2013 probably some incentive comp dynamic kind of moving around in the third quarter a little bit. Just wanted to get a sense maybe how sustainable you feel that type of run rate is with the topline that you're sort of expecting for the fourth quarter. Are there going to be some puts and takes maybe specifically on the incentive comp that we need to think about in the fourth quarter or and is there anything else we should be looking at?","Michael Upchurch","Yes, well let me go back to the current quarter first. While we did see some favorable true up on incentive comp, remember that was because we had $7 million of incremental network expenses. And we also had a fair amount of revenue and margin that ended up getting lost or deferred from the third quarter. So generally incentive comp whether it moves up or down is more than offset by incremental margin.","But as we look into 4Q, I would tell you slightly higher depreciation with the PTC in servicing on the comp maybe it's a couple of million higher going into the fourth quarter. We did obviously record a credit in the third quarter to true up the first half of the year. We do expect continuation of higher fuel costs and then Jeff mentioned some leased locomotives that we're going to add to the fleet here in the fourth quarter that will add about $1 million, little over $1 million. So hopefully those are the key puts and takes.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Matthew Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Reustle","So switching gears a bit it seems like you're making some progress at Lazaro. Can you talk a little bit about whether that's tied to the pricing rebates that you were referencing on the last call. And is it still possible that we see that volume turn positive year-over-year 4Q or early next year any updated guidance around that?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Matt, I would say we're very pleased with the results for Q3. When you think about what's happening in Lazaro, there's a couple of dynamics. Certainly, our pricing kind of led that off. I think people \u2013 there were some of the smaller carriers that took immediate beneficiary of that. But what I would tell you as well as we\u2019re also seeing a lot of congestion at the port of Manzanillo, which is just north of our port. And some of that trade is now being diverted down into Lazaro.","So, I think that \u2013 the fourth quarter, we're prepared to handle what we believe will be a very good quarter. Whether we're able to get all of the volume that we would like to get, I think it's still to be played out, but I think there's a couple of those big pieces. We have seen better fluidity there, certainly the congestion in Manzanillo, the pricing makes it able for customers to come back. And I think what's happening at least from our perspective is people are looking at the ports in a more balanced fashion. They're not playing each other against one another because they realized that all of the ports need to have capacity and fluidity.","And I think that we're seeing the benefit of that. So, we expect 2019 to be certainly a year where people take advantage of that. And so I feel pretty comfortable that we took the right steps. We did it, certainly are timing couldn't have been better and hopefully we'll see the benefit of that in Q4 and Q1 as well as into next year.","Matthew Reustle","And then just in terms of some of the initiatives you're talking about working with your customers on improving capacity inventory; have you considered or are you implementing stricter enforcement on demurrage detention, any thoughts around that?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","We certainly kind of can see what's going on in the other railroads around those areas. For me there are certain tools we have. First and foremost, working with customers to understand the overall benefits, and while an individual customer may desire to have more cars online for their comfort. Understanding and clarifying that, that has total system and network impacts and that could in theory hurt them.","So demurrage is one tool for sure, we have an active demurrage program. We utilize that effectively and I think we will continue to use the tools that we have to make sure we're incenting and really educating customers around what the right level of equipment. How we get there? For me it's more joint efforts, it's more understanding and clarification. However, we have other tools that are in our toolbox.","Jeffrey Songer","Probably a good example of other things that we're thinking about to create the kind of efficiency, fluidity, the investment that we're making in refined products terminals in Mexico, the story behind that those refined products tend to be loaded in unit train quantities in the U.S. refineries. And there just isn't capacity in Mexico for unit train unloading. So, we can congest our yards and we can handle this kind of lopsided out of balance supply chain where you load units on one side and you unload small quantities on the other side.","Congest our yard and argue about demurrage or we can actually use our financial wherewithal, work with our customers to create capacity to create more of a balance supply chain where we load units and we unload units. We have the same phenomenon in some of our grain locations. We have the same phenomenon in some of our steel locations. So, yeah, the demurrage I think is a useful tool to make sure that we and our customers are following the kind of discipline that we need.","But I think using our capital to \u2013 and working with our customers is not always going to be our capital. But working with our customers to create more capacity away from our yards or think differently about how we handle some of the flows of these products, I think is a good long-term solution and is going to produce the kind of benefits in terms of cycle time, improve cycle time, improve asset utilization, reduce congestion that we want to achieve longer-term.","Brian Hancock","Certainly the only other thing I would add is if you look at just the Monterrey area, the capacity that's been created at our customer's facility; brand-new automotive facility in the past in Mexico that wouldn't have the capacity to handle hardly anything from a storage perspective. Now with our help those facilities are significantly larger and it allows us to be able to drop a train, pick a train, be able to do things that we couldn't do otherwise.","The largest soybean facility in North America is now in Monterrey. In the past that facility would not have the capacity that it has, but again with our help and design - we're helping design these facilities. It's now the ability they can store a couple of trains and that creates fluidity on the mainline.","So I think what Pat said, what Jeff said, this is something that didn't exist in Mexico this mindset of creating capacity and logistics capacity at facilities really hasn't existed. And now you see these owners of the new buildings they're making those investments we're helping them do that in the correct way and I think we're going to see long-term benefits from that.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Mike, I was hoping I could unpack some of your comments on the capital budget for 2019 little bit. I believe you said kind of core CapEx flat to maybe even slightly down. The 50 locomotives, I believe you also said that you're selling 33, so there will be a bit of an offset there. Can you help us size up just incremental CapEx from that? A wide range is fine just trying to think about what that might look like?","Michael Upchurch","Yes, well let's take the mystery out the locomotive purchase will be about $140 million. The units that we're going to sell are 70 vintage, super sevens. I wish we could get the kind of price we pay for a new one, but that's going to be a pretty low number. So our net CapEx from locomotives is going to go up substantially. We haven't bought any locomotives since 2015.","Bascome Majors","And you kind of left a caveat in there about the project CapEx, is it that we plan to spin on some of these destination terminal projects and we just don't know what that number is or I mean if there's any kind of ballpark as to what that might look like if it comes true realizing that that's a good new story if it happens?","Michael Upchurch","Yes Bascome, I would tell you at this point we don't have any agreement with anybody else that would cause us to jump into a venture to build out new facilities, but we are having ongoing discussions with a number of different partners. We're kind of looking at those facilities as let's get them on our railroad and get the opportunity to get the line haul revenue there. But it's difficult sitting here today to know exactly whether or not we'll spend any incremental cash flow on those terminals down in Mexico.","Bascome Majors","Understood. And maybe kind of timing altogether I mean if you look it feels like this year that kind of in couple quarters of ratcheting down expectations is weighed on your multiple. As we look to next year, it looks like street revenues are something like high single-digit growth, low double-digit growth and the EBIT mid-teens and EPS, kind of 53% incremental margin. Is that something that gives you pause from where you sit today or if things go well is that something you think the KSU franchise can achieve?","Michael Upchurch","I think that's a backward way of asking for guidance for 2019. We'll talk about 2019 more at the end of the fourth quarter. We're in our budgeting process and working through where the right assumptions in terms of network recovery, service recovery. So we'll have more to say about that in January.","Operator","Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra","I'm going to take another stab at that 2019 question. So as we move from I guess 2018 to the 2019, CapEx is going up maybe set by some of that service and congestion issues that hopefully abate - would likely abate. You have a long-term kind of 50% incremental margin, EBIT margin target out there that you've talked about before. I mean, it seems like with crude carload's doing what they're doing, refined product carloads hopefully accelerating, lapsing of the headwind from coal; if you don't achieve it over 50% incremental margins in 2019 I mean maybe you have to reassess the long-term target. Is that a fair way of articulating it or am I missing some of the moving parts?","Michael Upchurch","Amit, this is Mike. I think that is a fair way to look at it. The first half of this year we really didn't have any volume growth and it's really difficult to generate 50% incremental margins in that kind of environment. You saw us do it here in the third quarter and rolling into 2019 with negative comp dropping off on coal. We would certainly expect nice volume and revenue growth. I'm not going to comment on specific numbers, but our target will not be any different than it is today to generate 50% incremental margins in that kind of an environment.","Amit Mehrotra","And just on the energy side of the house, the crude growth was obviously very strong maybe staggeringly strong you could say. And I guess that makes sense as given the crude coming out of Canada and you're now with the Synovus volumes coming online maybe over the next six months or so and CP obviously getting a fair chunk of that. Can you just talk about what the runway is in terms of crude carload growth and just how well the Company is capacitized I guess to handle that growth next year?","Brian Hancock","Amit this is Brian. Yes, we feel very good about what's going on with crude by rail. Certainly, we're working closely with our interchange partners and we feel very comfortable that we have the capacity necessary to do everything that we see in the future, everything that everyone else has spoken about that's going to hit our line. We feel very comfortable about it. It's a good business for us, we're certainly going to continue to see it grow looks like here over the next year, year-and-half. And so we're very comfortable, we can handle it.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","And just remember that none of that business goes cross-border or around the sort of Beaumont to Houston to Laredo route. So, to the extent that capacity has been freed up because of the reduction in our coal business, this is a really good fit for that part of our network.","Jeffrey Songer","And the spreads are extremely wide right now, WCS to mine and crude. So it should certainly give us an opportunity, but there are other railroads that operate in that region as well.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Pat, maybe just \u2013 I don't know if it is Pat or Jeff, but your insight into the congestion, I had a lot of questions on congestion already but how do you get ahead of that? Jeff you mentioned you want to turn the cars faster, the cars online, not just the Mexico number you put up there but cars online overall at all time highs and Dwell remains high. You're adding locomotives but I just want to understand how we learn that adding assets isn't really the long time answer, and I guess going back to Allison's question on. Do you need to overhaul the network and how you're operating it to try to get more efficient, is there something that significantly needs to change so we don't keep coming up with these congestion issues every couple quarters? Just to understand how you view operations in terms of what's going on and the congestion in cars online kind of continually being a sticking point?","Jeffrey Songer","Yes, this is Jeff. Do we need to do anything macro level to the system? No. Targeting these areas of congestion, Monterrey has been in the past and is right now kind of a source of congestion. But as I mentioned the investment in Sanchez to relieve that we got lot of additional capacity we've add there. So our ability to kind of make the operational changes that we've envisioned as we move on here into Q4 and next year should provide some of the benefit we've been anticipating.","This year last couple of quarter signaled the importance of the rail network and as we talk about our interchange and congestion that\u2019s moved from Texas to now Mexico. And I see inventories, take Sanchez for example we've cut those inventories in about half since the peak now. So, I feel much better that as inventory in cars to specific terminals move out that we can regain our normal operation and flow traffic between those terminals, flow traffic from the north now to the south because we have receiving capacity, for example, at Sanchez.","Ken Hoexter","Mike, when you're talking inventories, you're talking cars trapped in your yards or?","Michael Upchurch","Cars yes, cars overall cars online and now if you look at our total cars online, there are couple of drivers for that. One is just cycle times, the cars needing to move faster. And overall car volumes are still elevated in the U.S. trying to get south now. So this smoothing of the network is what we have to have happened. But again, the resiliency of the rail network and creating and eliminating congestion and not just moving this congestion back and forth across the bridge, it's dependent on the resiliency of the entire kind of U.S. and Mexico network. So, those are the things we\u2019re working out, those are the things that kind of led to some of the elevated inventories we saw going into this congestion.","Jeffrey Songer ","But I'd also go back to what we said earlier Ken, and that is things like looking \u2013 working with UP, working on developing a longer term strategic role for Brownsville Matamoros, resourcing that gateway properly to be able to play more of \u2013 more of a strategic role for both of us as opposed to go back to the phrase bleed valve that I think is an important part of that. And then particularly at the border recognizing that more than half of our traffic at the border is interchanged with UP, just working very, very closely with them as they work through their own operational changes and making sure that we're in sync with those.","The level of communication at all levels including the CEO level with UP as we work through this is very high. It has to be. And because most of the traffic we interchange at the border is going to and from them. Adding assets, adding capacity at Sanchez, we talked about adding capacity, we're not going to talk specifically but I'll go back and reinforce adding capacity at customer sites to handle some of the traffic that has historically congested our yards and improve cycle times for certain customers is a big contributing factor as well.","Michael Upchurch","I had one more example. We look at our refined products terminals, as Brian mentioned with where we're at today, which will certainly improve when tanks are up and running next year, if you look at cars online, private car tanks for it one example, because we're still running some of that in manifest because they're still kind of trans-loading those cars are remaining on our network for an elongated period of time.","It may take us two weeks to unload a unit train in the Salinas terminal right now, whereas we get into next year the tanks are there, additional capacity is provided. Those cars are going to turn a lot more rapidly. So I think I can't just look across the entire segment without kind of separating his issues or his additional elevated volumes because of 10 cars or car hoppers for some of the similar issues that \u2013 as capacity and some of these additional investments will continue to help out with.","Ken Hoexter","Glad to hear here some sense of urgency. I mean look forward to the solution, it just seems like that's what's going to help with your rapid growth and still seems like a lot of pinch points holding cars online at those high levels. But I guess if I could the follow-up, it was just a question on crude. I just want to understand your view Pat on crude. We heard from the carriers up north, they're hesitant in taking too much crude and really limiting it given not only their fear of over doing the available capacity, but really ensuring they're getting return because knowing that it's going to disappear in three years. So in three years or so, if you're going to have another one of like what's going on in coal where it massively just disappears, just want to understand how do you view crude by rail in terms of how much you want to take on given some of the capacity constraints you're talking about?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Very much in sync with what I heard from the CP yesterday. I listened to their call and we're approaching it very similar in terms of the way we're thinking about commercial arrangements to make sure that we don't suffer from kind of extreme volatility in that business and resource ourselves to the point where it doesn't sync up with the commitments that we have from customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","So, I know it's been a few years since you've given us this to us, but last time you reported it the OR in the U.S. was right around the 70, Can you maybe tell us directionally where we are today in mid-60s, high-60s, 70? And then even if you don't want to talk specifically about OR where we stand today; do you think there's any sort of structural reason why it shouldn't be sort of just as good as everybody else and if that's the case, is that something that you're focused on shrinking that gap?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I'll take the last question, absolutely. Are we focused on shrinking the gap? Yes. And do we think we can continue to show improvement in operating ratio? Yes, absolutely. We're spending a lot of time looking at, we compare ourselves to our peers. We look at dozens if not more in the cost and performance categories on a regular basis. We look at how are we performing versus the peers versus the best in class versus the industry, what the dollar value of that gap, is there any kind of structural or other reason that we can't be best in class, in some cases we are. Is there any reason we can't be average probably hard to accept why we can't be average.","And then looking at what's the dollar value of closing those gaps, what are the initiatives that are responsible to close those gaps who is accountable for it and what's an appropriate timeframe to think about it. So we have that methodology where we look at ourselves and compare ourselves to peers and try to develop that framework of gaps, targets, initiatives, timeframes and accountabilities to close those gaps. And I'm very confident that we can continue to show improved operating ratio performance kind of following that disciplined and focused methodology.","Scott Group","And just so we in trying to understand the opportunity, can you talk directionally where we are today in the U.S.?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","No, we don't report those separately, Scott. As you know the only requirement that had us reporting that separately was subsidiary debt that we had down in KCSM level and when we moved that up to the consolidated level we basically were relieved of that obligation. I mean, we look at this as one big long network with an interchange point at the border. We remain just as one business.","Scott Group","And then can you just help me think about sort of fourth quarter moving parts theory and typically your earnings are flat to maybe down a little bit, there's moving parts with incentive comp maybe some of the service cost going away, anything to just help us sort of calibrate models would be helpful Mike?","Michael Upchurch","Yes, I think in response to Chris's question I gave a little bit of guidance on the expense side up a bit in depreciation with PTC, a little bit of an increase in comp. We would expect fuel prices to continue to go up. Jeff, talked about the locomotive leases adding a little over $1 million. Typically fourth quarter revenue top line is lower than third quarter. Third quarter is typically the best quarter. You get a lot of manufacturing facilities that shutdown in mid-December.","Given that we were shy of where we had expected in the third quarter maybe that makes the comp going sequentially a little bit easier, but generally you're down, maybe this year will be somewhere in the flat range on revenue.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Wanted to start with a question on peak season, I'm curious what you've seen in your network in terms of the pull forward of freight ahead of tariffs. And if you strip out any impact from a pull forward, have you seen anything in the underlying demand environment that gives you pause related to inbound volumes at the ports particularly from China or are you still expecting this to be a pretty robust and strong peak season?","Brian Hancock","Hi, Justin, this is Brian. Yeah, we are very pleased with the way that the peak season has come in here in the third quarter at the beginning of the fourth quarter. I would tell you we saw a little bit of a pull up in our intermodal business and specifically in the steel area there before the tariffs. And that was more of the July\/August timeframe, so already in the number. We feel very comfortable that it's going to continue.","All signs from our customers are that there is significant growth in each one of the key areas that would drive that. We never - if you look back at 2018, in the first quarter, we thought that our intermodal volumes would drop off, they did not. And so everything that we're seeing and hearing is that the trucking shortage will continue.","So, we feel comfortable there. We will be ahead of where most of the forecasts are on automotive. We are, like Mike said, we are happy to lap our coal shutdown. So we're ready for that. I would say overall we feel very comfortable going into next year that our peak season this year has been robust and strong and most of our customers are planning to have a great 2019 as well. So, we feel good.","Justin Long","And secondly I was wondering if you could provide an update on Sasol? Any change to your expectation on when those shipments start up and how long it could take for that facility to ramp up, and then anything you could give us on the contribution in 2019 would be helpful as well? Thank you.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Sasol obviously we will always point you towards their website and their communications on that as to when they will ramp up. We feel very comfortable with the way that we planned it and in accordance with them we've got our plans into 2019. I think they've said that they will start to plan up here or they'll continue to ramp up in the fourth quarter.","It will be a slow ramp in 2019, but we feel very comfortable that the businesses that we support will be up and running and we'll start to see those volumes, we already start to see some of those volumes here in the late fourth quarter. But also I think you'll continue to see that ramp up into 2019.","Plastics is going to continue to be a slow roll across all of the railroads I think, as you see ports and different ports and different flows then there have used to been with regard to the resins. But we're going to continuously strengthen that for the next few years as all of these plants come online.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","So, two just kind of follow-up questions. We look at the frac sand volumes coming down significantly. Brian, can you give us bit of your exposure in basin if there's any way to pivot that into other areas as the in-basin sand starts to take more share?","Brian Hancock","Brian, that's certainly come down significantly faster than we thought it would. The white sand out of the Great Lakes area has just - has really slowed down. In-basin the brown sand has continued to be used more and more. We believe that that will continue where it will actually level out. We're not exactly sure, but we're pretty sure that the white sand is going to continue to slowdown.","And so from an exposure perspective it will really depend on where we see the balancing between the two. But I would expect to see brown sand continue to be utilized more in that Texas region and the white sand will probably drop off as it continues.","Brian Ossenbeck","And then just going back to refined products, the F\/X tax income administration has at least forward some commentary about possibly changing that to keep the inflation rate more in line with overall inflation. So just want to get your thoughts on that if you heard anything similar what the producers and shippers are telling you on that and how it will affect your, I guess the market and specific credit that you have from that mechanism?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Brian, I'll start that and then kind of tag teams this with Mike. I would say from a refined products perspective, the new administration has been extremely engaged in this area. They are concerned about stores, they are concerned about refining capacity and we've been engaged with them in understanding how we can support better utilization of their current refineries, helping them in developing storage.","How they price that in the market and how they look at that, I think that they're going through a learning process right now on how that all goes from a world pricing prospectus. And we're going to let them sort through that, but we feel very comfortable that they are engaged and continuing with Mexico energy reform. They realized to keep their economy growing they've got to have additional stores, they've got to have additional sources. And quite frankly the Gulf Coast and the refineries there are just perfect spots to feed that volume. So, we're going to continue to see significant volume growth. So, from a pricing out maybe let Mike take that one.","Michael Upchurch","Well, Brian, if you're asking what's the impact of potentially moving up or down on IEPS to our fuel expense. I think it's pretty clear that the current administration has used the opportunity to lower IEPS to try to manage the increase in fuel costs in Mexico. It's hard to say exactly what the new administration might do when they take office later this year, but I guess I continue to view IEPS as lowers the credit may be a little bit lower for us but it will also be saving that in the purchase of fuel, we won't have to pay that. So should essentially be a net wash to us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Nat, on for Brandon. Just looking at your automotive business looking out we see in your investor presentation that production is up. We've seen some estimates that put it maybe more in the flat to even down range. Just broadly do you think you'll be able to outgrow the market from here and what gives you confidence in the outlook for the automotive business?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, I would say that our automotive business continues to be strong. We had several opportunities this year to pick up share, and which we did. So, will we outgrow the market? I don't know that. I mean, production is going to continue to grow as forecast. Our expectations are and I think that 2018 has been in line with that that we will exceed the production increases that are planned.","We do believe we're picking up share at some of the key facilities but we also believe that we've created some unique service offerings for some of our largest customers that have allowed us to pick up that share and so we're continuing to look at how do we create unique opportunities, unique service offerings that allow them to meet their goals at the same time get better utilization across the railroad. So, I think we'll continue to see strength in our automotive business.","Michael Upchurch ","Matt, this is Mike. Just about share, if you look at the third quarter results we were up in the auto segment and our competitor in Mexico was actually down. I think that's been true most of the year. So I think the takeaway there is we're probably are taking some share.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just following-up, could you clarify a little on your comment around flat revenue in the fourth quarter sequentially?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Well, don't read too much into that. I just - my comment was generally speaking from the seasonal standpoint you would expect fourth quarter revenue to be lower than third quarter revenue. This year obviously our third quarter revenue could have been a lot higher had we operated the network efficiently. But going into the fourth quarter I kind of look at it may be as flat revenues from 3Q to 4Q, maybe we're a little bit above that. We'll just have to see.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","I want to touch base a little bit on some of your commentaries about the lack of logistics investment historically in Mexico and given that we're sitting here on the precipice of NAFTA 2.0, how should we look at foreign direct investment and what are the long term implications for the growth down there for you guys?","Brian Hancock","Jason, this is Brian. I made that comment and so what I would tell you is I think that that companies are becoming smarter in understanding that logistics infrastructure is essential when you build a facility. You can look at the two major auto facilities that were created this year, both of those a big part of the construction has been what is the logistics infrastructure necessary to support this facility.","And so you think about storage, and it's not just rail, you have trucking storage, you have rail storage. And what I would tell you is, most of that design work was not done. If you think about the manufacturing facilities that were built in the '80s and '90s in the Mexico right after the North American free trade agreement was put in, I would say that logistics was not the primary concern.","I believe now those companies now look at those investments certainly in the steel industry, automotive, grain, as Pat mentioned, they're looking for how do I get better utilization of my assets. They realize that once the asset is in, the largest cost they have is infrastructure from a logistics perspective or logistics expense. And so they're putting in additional track, they're putting in - you see people putting in loop track, you see them putting in a large storage yards for trucking.","And so what I would say is, Mexico is developing, they're evolving. And when you think about logistics infrastructure, we're just a big part of that, a big facilitator of certainly the rail infrastructure but also helping these big manufacturers and these big CPG companies if you will, create infrastructure that allows them to be more efficient at their plants and not just to manufacturing a low cost manufacturing hub but a real fulfillment mindset inside of these facilities.","And it takes time, but I would say at least the two or three big facilities that have been built over the last two years, every single one of them has incredible rail and truck infrastructure that just wouldn't have been present just 10 years ago.","Jason Seidl","That's great color, Brian. So this is more of a mind and not necessarily a NAFTA thing, but NAFTA is probably not going to hurt it.","Jeffrey Songer","No. But I think the other thing is, and Brian hit on this. If you think about new auto plants, those facilities are being built right out of the gate with adequate - [KIA], the new facilities that we worked, they're doing that right at the very beginning. Where we see room for improvement and room to possibly invest or co-invest with some of our customers to create better logistic efficiencies are in some of the older facilities like grain and steel that weren't built initially with that logistics and storage capacity. So, that's been a source of congestion in our yards, it's been a source of delays in cycle times or extended cycle times.","So, we're trying to go into some of those older facilities and fix them so that we have more of a balance. Grains, probably a great example. Most of our grain facilities are unit shuttle loaders, so we can load 110 or 120 car train very efficiently, then we take them down into Mexico and they're broken up into 25 car blocks with congestion in our yards and congestion in mainline and all that kind of thing.","So, we're trying to fix those facilities so that we can create those efficiencies or some of the older facilities that we serve. Your question about NAFTA and U.S. MCA, NAFTA is gone, remember? And then direct foreign investment, the thing is interesting over the last couple of quarters in spite of the uncertainty of the trade agreement, direct foreign investment has continue to be pretty strong. We think the removal of this cloud of uncertainty, remember we got to get it through congress in all three countries yet. But the removal of that uncertainty we certainly see as being positive for foreign investment in Mexico going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.","Tyler Brown","Can you update us on your cash tax paying status post the tax reform? I think the guilty provisions and basically the NOLs, so I think you paid maybe like $50 million in cash taxes last year, just curious what you think you'll pay this year kind of how that trends over the next couple and basically when do you think you'll be a full cash taxpayer?","Jeffrey Songer","Yes, we're going to trend up being a cash taxpayer. We have been paying cash taxes in Mexico for a while. We'll pay some in the U.S. but I would probably guide you somewhere in the low 20s to 24%, 25% range.","Tyler Brown","And then, I'm not sure if this is for Pat or Mike, but I hate to be picky here but what exactly is going on at the PCRC? I mean, it looks like it lost money this quarter versus maybe something like a $20 million below the line annual benefit at its peak. So basically what's going on there? Is this the canal having some structural impairment of that business or am I reading into it too much?","Michael Upchurch","No, I think they just had some difficulties with couple of customers, loss of some business. It's - I think we'll get through it and should start to see reversal of some of those trends in the future.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Tyler, just to be clear, it's not just PCRC that's in those numbers venture down in San Luis Potos\u00ed, TSCM, it's included in that. The terminal operator in Mexico City FTVM, that we have a 25% ownership. Interest in is also included there. So it's not just PCRC, but yes, their business is definitely down.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Baudendistel with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Baudendistel","Just wanted to ask you, I mean, EUP received a letter from STB regarding potential service concerns from changing operations with precision scheduled railroading. History tells us that could lead to some service issues at least near term getting worse before getting better. Do you share those concerns and is there anything you can do to ensure that they remain effective interchange partner?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes, I mean we're staying on our toes. We think EUP, what they have said publicly, what they've told us is they're going to go about this perhaps in a different way than some of their peers. But all I can say is we're on our toes, we're staying very close to them so that we anticipate and we can prepare and plan for any changes in behavior that we've come to expect that we've seen in the past as they make their transition to a different model. Communication level is very, very high as I said earlier at all levels with EUP right now.","Mike Baudendistel","And then just wanted to ask you, I think you said core pricing came in at 3.7%, I mean is there a forward looking metric there that you can provide of renewals?","Michael Upchurch","No, I would tell you that the 3.7% is a good metric. We feel very comfortable in the pricing and this is a great pricing environment, right. So we're going to continue to see strong pricing opportunities both in Mexico and U.S. and we're going to take advantage of that where we can and we feel very comfortable especially in the mix that we see happening, the changes that we're going be very positive in the pricing space. So, we feel pretty comfortable that we'll stay very close to this type of pricing here into the near future.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Ottensmeyer, I'd like to turn the floor back to you for closing comments.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","All right. Well, I can't think of anything left unsaid at this point.

While I would love to talk about a 340% EPS growth for the fourth quarter and 107% EPS for the full year as Mike Upchurch will cover in great detail the impact of U.S. tax reform had a very large impact on our results particularly earnings per share, so I'll focus more on the still impressive 23% increase for the quarter and 17% for the full year.","So, flipping over to slide 6 you can see for the full year revenue increase of 11% on 5% volume growth and importantly for the full year we saw revenue growth in all of our six major business units and again Brian will cover that in a few minutes. Operating ratio of 64.3, a 60 basis point improvement from last year and earnings per share of 5.25 adjusted, a 17% increase compared to 2016. So with that I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer.","Jeffrey M. Songer","Thank you Pat and good morning. Reviewing the key operating metrics for the quarter on slide 8, velocity of 27.3 miles per hour was down approximately 2% versus prior year, a low of 23.6 hours improved 4% versus the same period last year. Lingering Harvey impacts, Mexico flooding issues mentioned last quarter as well as typical holiday seasonal impacts drove the increases in Dwell versus Q3. ","Looking at the full year operating performance several other key metrics showed improvement. Resource productivity initiatives delivered total volume growth of 5% supported by 3% headcount increase and GTM growth of 9% with a 5% increase in active locomotors. We also saw improvements in On Time Originations and On Time Arrivals of 8% and 9% respectively, fuel efficiency improvements of 2%. On page 9 our capital outlook for 2018 shows a reduction of approximately 4% 560 million to between 530 million and 550 million. Reductions in the Sasol Investment which is now complete and other reductions in PTC and Sanchez Yard have somewhat been offset by investments in new projects and continued growth opportunities.","A couple of projects we're discussing are the rehabilitation of our F-Line in Mexico which is the segment between Monterey and our border crossing at Matamoros. Driven by the long-term outlook for refined product exports to Mexico the F-Line is another viable gateway for refined products and other cross border shipments. We have elected to start a multi-year rehabilitation of this line to ensure safe and efficient movement across the segments. The Celaya Bypass is another project we have talked about recently. Celaya is the connection point of our main north-south route in the Ferromex, east-west route between Guadalajara in Mexico City. This project will provide benefit to both railroads and improve the overall fluidity and interchange between our networks and we now project to start work in 2018.","One other notable investment which will start in 2018 is our participation in track construction to support the BMW facility for its planned 2019 opening. The current 2018 plan will mark the fourth year in a row of declining capital spend both on an absolute basis and as a percent of revenue. Heading into 2018 we will maintain a close eye on resources. PTC will create some additional demand on resources as we work to complete implementation across our network. However, our current crew base is in a good position and we will continue to work on crew efficiencies while ensuring adequate resources to manage volumes. ","Regarding locomotives while we have not included any purchases in our 2018 capital plan we will continue to monitor volume and particularly the refined products segment and timing of these opportunities.","We believe there are ample options to short-term leases or purchases that would allow us to add additional resources if necessary. Overall I'm very pleased with our operating performance this year. Our operating team overcame major challenges with Mother Nature and improved operations while delivering solid volume growth. I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock.","Brian Hancock","Thank you Jeff and good morning everyone. I'll start my comments on page 11 where you can see fourth quarter year-over-year revenue was up 10% and volumes were up 5%. And as we'll see on the next slide full year revenue and volume growth are at 11% and 5% respectively. The chemical and petroleum business unit revenue growth of 24% was primarily driven by solid performance and our longer length of haul Southbound refined products and LPG business as well as our heavy fuel oil. The industrial and consumer segment also showed improvement in the fourth quarter with revenue growth of 8% and an increase of volume of 10%. This growth was a result of the continued strength we saw during the quarter in our military and paper shipments. ","The paper segment was impacted by increased brown paper demand seen during the quarter paired with easy comps during the fourth quarter mill outages of 2016. This quarter our energy line of business growth was due to crude oil and frac sand improvement driving a year-over-year revenue increase of 15% on a volume increase of 3%. The crude volume increase was primarily driven by the increased production in Canada with decreased pipeline capacity paired with increasing [indiscernible] WCS spreads. The automotive business was up 15% over 2016 driven primarily by growth in manufacturing capacity as new model launches continued driving year-over-year growth. In addition fourth quarter volumes benefited from inventory carry over caused by the hurricane impacts of Q3. ","Intermodal revenue and volume increases have improved to 5% partly driven by the new business and the New Cross Border Services with the slight drop in RPU due to mix and shorter length of haul. Our investments in service improvements and security have positioned us well against the continued stiff competition from low trucking rates and ocean shipping consolidation. The agricultural and minerals lines of business revenue was down slightly year-over-year on a 9% volume decline driven by grain and food products. Grain volume declines were driven by the new plant stockpiling during fourth quarter of 2016 in Monterey. Food products experienced a shift in sourcing trends and volume declines were offset by favorable pricing and a longer length of haul. ","Turning to the next slide you can see in 2017 annual revenue was up 11% and volumes were up 5% in spite of the hurricane impacts experienced in the third quarter. Overall very solid performance with revenue growth in all of the business units including double-digit growth in energy, automotive, and chemical and petroleum. Overall RPU for the year came in at 5.8% driven primarily by changes in the portfolio mix. On slide 13 we provide an outlook for 2018 for each of the business segments. As you can see we expect good growth from the majority of the businesses led by the chemical and petroleum group. Mexico energy reform will be a significant focus for 2018 including the continued ramp up of volume driven by more storage projected to come online later in the year. We also expect solid growth in intermodal with continued focus on conversion of the cross border freight currently moving by truck and solid growth out of our Lazaro Cardenas port facility. ","We'll continue to see growth in the automotive segment in the mid single-digits which is in line with most third party industry estimates for the Mexico auto production. We should also see positive growth in the grain and food products volumes after 2017 which included the impact of the 2016 inventory build at the new soybean facility in Monterrey. We expect economic activity in 2018 to be positive which should drive our industrial and consumer businesses in both steel and paper. Year-over-year comps in military shipments could be difficult given the strong performance we had in 2017. ","The only unfavorable business unit would currently be our energy segment that will be impacted by the closing of a coal fired power generation facility in Texas, however, we do expect both crude and frac sand to be solid in 2018. Overall we expect mid single-digit carload growth for the full year of 2018, however, revenue per unit will be impacted by mix as we expect growth in our relatively low RPU intermodal business. Additionally we will see some RPU mix pressure from a reduction in the long haul utility core volume due to that plant closure.","Finally on page 14 I want to provide an update on Mexico energy reform. After our third quarter report we received several questions regarding what investors should look for to determine the rate and pace of this important initiative in Mexico. We would like to suggest the following important drivers of growth during the next few years. First, the emergence of alternative retail outlets, this will signal that consumption and demand are being serviced by multiple retail brands expanding the number of shippers into the country. ","Second, the emergence of storage capacity. Millions of barrels of storage are required over the next seven years to meet the government's objectives. This will be a critical signal as to how the market is developing in certain regions of the country. Third, pipeline construction, the rate and pace of these projects will be a good indicator of how quickly they will influence the market. Current estimates are that any major project is at least five to seven years away from completion. Fourth we would focus on terminals that are on the KCS line. In 2017 we announced volumes moving to the Howard Terminal in San Jose Iturbide, our joint venture facilities in San Luis Potosi and Monterrey as well as several other projects [indiscernible] and Mexico City. We continue to believe high density terminals with a very fast unloading capability are critical to the long-term success of rail shipments. We will continue to update you as this important market change evolves in the coming months and years. And with that I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Upchurch.","Michael W. Upchurch","Thanks Brian and before I review the slides I have to tell you it's a bit strange this morning looking around the table and missing two extremely valuable team members Bill Galligan our Former Vice President of Investor Relations and Mary Stadler our Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer both who retired two weeks ago. So, Bill and Mary whatever beach you might be on today know you made KCS a much better place and I thank you again for all your tremendous contributions over the years. ","So let's start with the numbers on slide 16. A summary of overview of our fourth quarter 2017 results, revenues of 660 million were up 10% driven by 5% carload growth and 4% plus revenue per unit growth. Operating ratio improved to 64% and 80 basis point improvement despite an 18% increase in fuel prices. Reported earnings per share for the quarter was $5.33, a 340% increase over fourth quarter 2016 representing strong core earnings growth and the benefit of tax reform. ","On an adjusted basis earnings per share was a $1.38, a 23% increase over 4Q 2016. Our reported effective tax rate was negative 186% due mainly to the benefits of tax reform and on an adjusted basis our effective tax rate was 32.8% slightly below the 34% guidance. And on slide 33 in the appendix we've included a reported to adjusted effective tax rate reconciliation. ","Moving to slide 17 on a full year basis we delivered a terrific year with 5% carload growth, 11% revenue growth, a 60 basis point improvement in OR to 64.3 and 17% improvement in adjusted earnings per share to $5.25 evidence that delivering top line growth while improving OR can lead to significant EPS growth. We delivered these results despite experiencing negative financial impacts from hurricane Harvey in the third quarter and incurring much higher fuel prices throughout the year which increased more than 50 million year-over-year. On a reported basis we were $9.16 per share for the full year which is inclusive of tax reform benefits and I'll spend a few more minutes on tax reform on the next slide. But for a more complete condensed income statement and foreign currency tax and hedge impacts please refer to the appendix. ","On the next slide I'm going to spend a few minutes trying to highlight the key impacts of tax reform to KCS. While tax reform has a net positive impact to KCS they certainly didn't simplify the tax code particularly for multinational companies. I'll try to summarize to the best I can the overall benefits we expect to see from lower tax rates and from immediate expensing of capital expenditures which are offset by the negative impacts of a onetime repatriation tax and other foreign income inclusion provisions. ","So first, the U.S. statutory rate is declining from 35% to 21% which requires us to revalue the net deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet. Accordingly we are reducing our net deferred tax balance by $488 million as a result of the reduced 21% rate we now expect to pay on previously recorded tax liabilities. Second, we expect to incur a onetime repatriation tax of 177 million which represents approximately 1.5 billion as cumulative foreign earnings of our international subsidiaries. New and existing tax credits reduce that liability to 45 million now payable over an eight year period. So you might think of this one time repatriation tax as a 3% incremental tax on our historical foreign earnings. ","Third, we expect our historical adjusted effective tax rate of 34% to be reduced to 29% to 30% over the foreseeable future. Included in this effective tax rate guidance is an approximately 1% rate increase due to the provisions of the guilty tax that are intended to tax intangibles moved to offshore to take advantage of low tax rates in foreign jurisdictions. Not only does KCS not have intangibles but we do not operate in a low tax country as all of our earnings in Mexico are already taxed at 30%.","Fourth, we do not expect any negative impacts from the beat tax, the base erosion anti-abuse tax. Fifth, as a result of the U.S. tax reform we expect our projected cash taxes over the next three years to decline by approximately $90 million. However, we are moving into a period where KCSM will begin incurring more substantial cash taxes and accordingly we expect our consolidated cash tax rate to be in the range of 20% to 25% over the next few years. And finally the move to a more of a territorial tax system or cash can be moved more freely to the U.S. from foreign countries without incurring new taxes should substantially benefit KCS.","Moving to slide 19, operating expenses increased 9% driven primarily by higher fuel prices that contributed in a $11 million increase in expense. And on the topic of fuel we also saw $5 million lower Mexican fuel excise tax credit as a result of the excise tax declining during the fourth quarter. We also saw increases in wage inflation, higher expenses from foreign currency impacts, and higher casualty expenses. I will cover more details on comp and fuel in the next two slides but maybe just a quick comment on materials and other, while we experienced a $9 million increase year-over-year $3 million of that was related to a gain for insurance recoveries we booked in the fourth quarter of 2016 and barely causes a difficult comp. ","We did see a challenging quarter for derailments and other casualty expenses that increased 2 million and our insourcing of various maintenance agreements adds another approximately million in M&O. And to give you a little bit of visibility for 2018 on expense tailwinds and headwinds we continue to believe we will keep headcount growth below carload volumes, we expect PTC operating expenses of approximately 32 million that's split 18 million in depreciation expense and 14 million in labor costs. So for the full year 2018 we expect depreciation expense to be approximately $360 million.","Moving to slide 20, comp and benefits expense increased 6% primarily on wage inflation and higher headcount. As you can see in the graphs, excluding another insourcing effort to reduce our overall costs headcount went up 2% well below our carload volume growth of 5% and demonstrates the nice productivity we achieved in our operating team. On slide 21 fuel expenses increased $14 million or 21% primarily due to the $11 million in higher fuel prices in both the U.S. and Mexico increasing our cost per gallon from $2.01 to $2.37 per gallon. Higher fuel consumption added 2 million of expense, FX and other 2 million in increases and efficiency contributed a $1 million decline to fuel expense. ","We also experienced the $5 million lower Mexican fuel excise tax credit during the fourth quarter. The good news and as we expected the excise tax credit for railroads on fuel purchases will continue in 2018 which we currently expect to be about $35 million. And finally on slide 23 our capital allocation priorities will continue to be focused on investing back into our business to drive industry leading growth. As Jeff mentioned earlier our CAPEX spending of 560 million was right in line with our guidance and for 2018 we expect our CAPEX to slightly decline to 530 million to 550 million, the fourth consecutive year of declining CAPEX spend and declining CAPEX to revenue ratios. During 2017 we also made 20 million in investments in liquid terminals in Mexico to stimulate more line haul traffic for our petroleum segment. And you should expect we will continue to look for investment opportunities to grow our business as a result of energy reform in Mexico. ","As for shareholder returns we will continue to be thoughtful about balancing our investment needs to grow the business with the desire to return a reasonable amount of capital to our shareholders in the form of both dividends and stock buybacks. Since the Board of Directors authorized a new $800 million share repurchase program in August 2017 we have repurchased another 2.4 million shares at an average price of $105.48. And while we continue to find opportunistic situations to repurchase or convert leased equipment into owned assets we are gradually nearing the end of that opportunity. We now own 70% of our rolling stock in locomotives and have a leverage ratio of 2.1 times, both levels we are quite comfortable with. And with that I'll turn the call back to Pat. ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay, thanks Mike. I will wrap up here with slide 24 just, we certainly didn't feel right about not talking about NAFTA on our call today given that round six begins next week and by all external reports that could be an exciting week. We have no new news per se but I think this round is expected to really focus because so many of the minor issues and minor chapters of NAFTA have been resolved by a lot of reports. The big issues are probably going to come to the table and rise to the surface this next week. So the five year sunset, the country rules of origin, government procurement rules, and ISDS are expected to be the central focus of the negotiations next week in Montr\u00e9al.","The -- we get a lot of questions about what would happen if there's a collapse of NAFTA or a withdrawal, what would happen to our business levels and trust as we've done a lot of sensitivities as we look at our planning not just related to outcomes of the NAFTA negotiation process but general economic conditions, etcetera. So we we've done a lot of that work. We think we could scale very quickly and very appropriately to preserve profitability and cash flow under a wide range of scenario and potential downturn outcomes. But we're not going to talk specifically or give guidance about what part of our business we think we would lose or what would happen to our volumes and revenues because there are just too many unknowns to really know how we would be effective. ","If there would be a collapse or withdrawal of NAFTA the immediate safety net would be WTO rules and tariffs would apply to those commodities and products that are covered by NAFTA, those are not horrible. Oddly enough they are more punitive to U.S. exports to Mexico particularly grain than they are to imports from Mexico to the U.S. Furthermore approximately 60% of trade between the U.S. and Mexico today doesn't have a specific connection to NAFTA so we would assume the biggest commodity group in that category would be energy. So we would assume that that portion of the trade between the U.S. and Mexico would not be affected. As you know about 30% of our revenue and volume comes from cross border franchise moves. So it is a significant part of our portfolio but not the majority. ","And then the final thing is just the sheer magnitude of investments in plants and supply chains between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. That investment is not going to go idle and we would expect that that is going to support a continuation of most of the trade values that take place between U.S. and Mexico if there were a bad outcome of NAFTA. But we need to be prepared and certainly aware of the fact that next week could be a headline week for Kansas City Southern depending on the sentiment and the news that comes out of the negotiations in Montreal. ","Really glad Mike picked up on recognizing the retirement of Bill Galligan and Mary Stadler but I certainly want to assure all of you and point out that we've got very talented people moving into those roles and around the table today we have Ashley Thorne and Suzie Grafton who is our new Chief Accounting Officer. They have both been here for a long time and very capable and as much as we will miss Bill and Mary we won't we won't miss a beat so to speak because of talented people in the form of Ashley and Suzie that are taking those positions. ","So in the past few quarters I've given you some guidance as to what the headline from our perspective is. I suppose we'll see something like modest beat for the quarter so credit to the Wall Street crowd, you have kind of got it right in terms of the outlook and the expectations for the quarter. But I hope people notice that this is really at least four very solid, very consistent at some level fourth quarter in a row that we've had the word record in our press release, in our results. Had it not been for the Hurricane Harvey disruption in the third quarter I think that would have been a more solid quarter but four very solid consistent quarters and an outlook going back to the slide that Brian showed, an outlook for 2018 based on assumptions that we have made about the economy and a lot of other factors that I think are very solid grounded in reality based on the best information that we have today. 90% of our business and commodity portfolio looks like it's going to be positive for 2018 with the only exception being energy where we've had a major plant closing that is just going to be hard for us to overcome. So with that I will conclude our official comments here and open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning, thanks for taking my question. ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Good morning Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","So, we are kind of past the one year mark on energy markets regulation in Mexico, clearly there has been a lot of change in that time and the government even lifted the fuel caps month early last year. So it doesn't seem like the prices have risen as much as you might have thought. It seems like that's related to the IX tax, we've also seen open season kind of moving ahead and fits and starts with PEMEX so, Brian if you can just -- and you gave us lot of detail there on that one slide but is this really second half inflection as we get past some of the political uncertainty with the presidential election and I guess more importantly getting some of these tanks up at the few sites that you mentioned?","Brian Hancock","Yeah Brian thanks for the question. Obviously we continue to be excited about the Mexico energy reform. Certainly the big impact for us is going to be once the tanks and the storage facility start to come online. It is certainly -- in 2017 the story kind of two halves. There was a lot of uncertainty at the beginning of the year when people weren\u2019t sure how that was going or how the price was going to impact. They did use the IX tax to manage that a little bit from a consumer perspective. We have seen and we're working with a number of folks who now have retail outlets on the ground, major companies obviously multinational companies that now have a retail location in Mexico. And so we're starting to see kind of what we talked about in the first quarter of last year, going into 2018 we feel very, very comfortable that it's just going to continue to grow all of the ports, all of the barrels that we thought would be coming into particular areas are doing that. And so we continue to be very, very positive on what's going to happen. Jeff talked a little bit about the investments we're making in capacity and safety and security, all of that is focused on as these tanks come on. We do have the tank in San Jose it has been up but in 2018 you're going to see a lot more storage capabilities, a lot more foreign retail owned, and with the election I believe the government will continue to manage that price a little bit with the IX tax but once that's complete and the storage is in I think you're going to see some pretty positive things from an overall Mexico energy market perspective. So good question and we think we're positioned very well for it.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, thanks and then just a quick follow-up on the labor market trends, you've been able to keep -- headcount last year and expecting do so this next year, in general it is a tighter labor market for just about everything including real team employees. So I guess specifically in Mexico how does that shape, maybe a question for Jeff because in the past you've run into some issues there where volumes really got ahead of the staffing levels and you had to kind of do a hard reset and reconfigure some of the actual management team and go back into labor negotiations, so how does that stand? And I guess are you seeing any benefits from that deal that you negotiate I guess that was maybe 18 months or so? ","Jeffrey M. Songer","Yeah, you are right, as stated I am feeling very comfortable where we're at on the headcount. I'm hoping we can gain -- start gain more efficiencies and I think we will through the year. The lessons learned from a couple years ago really what that ended up doing is ensuring we have an adequate force. And so maybe we run that a little bit heavy from time to time but that ensures we've got that -- if you recall we talked a lot about just the longevity of hiring and training in the process. So believe we've got that under our belt so I feel very comfortable where we're at and we're certainly looking forward at the volume growth. Certainly it was an impact for us this year on the volume growth and I think we're positioned well if that's not going to be an issue going into 2018.","Brian Ossenbeck","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions. ","Ravi Shanker","Thanks everyone. Can you just give us an update on pricing in the quarter but sequentially and year-on-year and also your expectations are for pricing in 2018?","Brian Hancock","Sure and this is Brian. Our pricing kind of came in where we had seen most of the year come in right around that 3% range. We're very comfortable with where we're at right now from a pricing perspective. Obviously there are a number of factors impacting the intermodal space that you are seeing with some of the trucking companies and others. But for our particular set we still -- we continue to see the pressure on our intermodal pricing down in Mexico. So we continue to hold where we're at there. But overall we're very positive on where we're at and we believe we will continue to see that into the future.","Ravi Shanker","Right, is there a pricing numbering you can share with us that was sequentially a higher or lower versus last quarter?","Brian Hancock","It's pretty much the same.","Ravi Shanker","Got it and lastly on NAFTA I'm just trying to look at the -- obviously there is a lot of uncertainty there, I am trying to figure out what the bull and the bear case here is. If there is a bull case outcome and there's basically no change and the way NAFTA is structured do you feel like there's a bunch of pending business that people are kind of holding off announcing right now that will kind of flood into the market and so you could see a surge and kind of longer-term volumes if that happens? At the same time if there is a bear case outcome on NAFTA do you expect any change in either the concession or any regulatory credits if you will to help you guys kind of defray the impact? ","Brian Hancock","On the bull case not that we're aware of so you know we don't -- I don't have the feeling that there's a big pent up demand or sort of announcements about new plants or new investments. On the downside case we would expect and I've heard from Mexican government officials of very high level that if there is a collapse of NAFTA, for example just picking up on the ISDS, the investor protection that if there is a withdraw all or if there is a collapse and ISDS is no longer part of NAFTA that the Mexican government may incorporate some of those investment protection features into their own law. So I wouldn't be surprised and I would kind of expect based on what I've heard that maybe Mexico would do some things from a legal perspective that would give that type of assurance to foreign investors that currently exists under NAFTA that might be removed.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Good morning Allison. ","Allison Landry","Good morning, thank you. So I just want to ask a little bit about refined products, the storage facilities seem like maybe they're coming on toward the back half of the year. So, as we think about the cadence of the volume growth would you expect the first quarter and second quarter to moderate a bit from the growth that we've seen so far and then went back up in the second half of the year, is that right way to think about it? ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yeah Allison, the way I would have you look at it is when you think about what we're doing now so we're moving refined products to all three of those facilities. We weren't doing that in 2017 throughout the whole yield. In the fourth quarter we kind of got all three of those facilities up and running. So you'll continue to see volumes move north if you will on that front in all three of those facilities. You will also start to see some of the volumes moving off of the ports that will probably be in our numbers here in the next few quarters. When we talk about the tankage, the important part of that is mostly tanks are being built are somewhere in the range of about 150,000 barrels, that allows us to not have to have storage inside a rail car. We can use the storage tanks for that storage purpose and so we can turn those cars much faster. So that's the reason that that's important. When you have three locations you can land trains at significantly better situation than where we're at now, where we have to land the train and then we do that transloading directly into trucks. So, I think that's the way you'll see it and as that storage comes on you will obviously see us be able to turn those trains much faster.","Allison Landry","Okay great. And then sort of just a follow up question as you think about Sasol, you mentioned that you have -- to get the investment there, I think the timing as of the last call was sometime in the second half, just curious to know if there's any update there when you think you might be able to move some volumes and if you have received any clarity on Sasol as to what they're thinking about in terms some destinations and specifically how much you think that you'll be able to move out of Lazaro?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yeah, I would tell you Allison that we are in weekly contact with Sasol and I would refer you to their plans. They've obviously already announced that second half of 2018 is when they will be starting up. We're working with them on those plans. We feel very comfortable that there will be a percentage somewhere in that 5% to 10% that will go into Mexico. Now whether it's the transload, export, whatever it will be but obviously we're going to touch every single one of those cars whether it's going North America, Europe. And so we feel very comfortable with the plan that they have put in place and I'll just refer you to them on when that startup happens. But we're in constant contact and we have a pretty good idea of what we need to do and the impact it will have on our business. So we're good there at Sasol. ","Michael W. Upchurch","Allison this is Mike, just a reminder that we do generate lease revenues here in the first half of the year before they officially open up their plant. So there will be a little bit of a lift in the revenue line item.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line Matt Russell with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions. ","Matthew Russell ","Thanks for taking my question. Quickly on intermodal, can you talk about how the tight trucking market in the U.S. is impacting your business and is it helping accelerate the market share gains from highway to rail, can you maybe talk about the opportunity there and whether you are seeing an acceleration in that trend? ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Sure Matt, obviously intermodal is a key factor in U.S. as you see the drivers short especially that you saw in the fourth quarter. We play a part of that from a domestic perspective across our Meridian Speedway in the Dallas area and some other places from Dallas into Mississippi. But what I would tell you is the biggest impact for us is obviously the cross border piece which is still being impacted by the very cheap trucking down in Mexico. So we don't see nearly the benefit that you would see on some of the other railroads that have much longer haul in their intermodal space but we are seeing much more of our customer base looking to build towards intermodal because once things do get into the U.S. you don't have a driver to move them. And so we are seeing an impact but we're also very, very tied into the Lazaro Cardenas port and we have a very heavy business there in domestic Mexico. So we're a little bit more diversified in our intermodal space but that cross bidder business will continue to grow as we saw this year and we'll continue to support our domestic partners as well.","Matthew Russell ","Great, and just a follow up, I know there's some large customer bids out in the intermodal business in the first quarter, can you just talk about how those negotiations are going and the pricing there? ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yeah I think we're in a very good place right now. In our intermodal bids people are more receptive to intermodal because of the tight labor market, because of the tight driver shortage. So they're more receptive to our solutions, we're giving them much more complex solutions that they have for their supply chains. So we feel very comfortable that we're going to have a good year and that we have a great product out there in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi Group. Please proceed with your question. ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Good morning Chris. ","Chris Wetherbee","Hey good morning guys. Wanted to ask a little bit about some thoughts on the operating ratio for 2018, I know you don't give specific guidance but you've been able to sort of continue to move that number lower for a record again. I want to get a sense sort of if you could help walk us through some of the puts and takes, it looks like the fuel excise taxes credit is coming down but cash would grow lower than volumes. So I think there's the potential for some operating leverage here but if you could just sort of help us put some color around that that would be great?","Michael W. Upchurch","Sure Chris, this is Mike. I think as you look at some of our costs, labor productivity I think is something you should expect out of us. I might have Jeff comment a little bit on that but our investments we made in fuel technologies for the locomotive should continue to produce some fuel expense benefits, we've talked a lot this year about contract renegotiations and in sourcing. We benefited about $11 million in 2017. When I think about at least half of that being some incremental savings going into 2018. And then I think we've begun to make some real progress around equipment cycle times that should continue to improve. But let me let Jeff comment a little bit about labor. ","Jeffrey M. Songer","Yeah, on labor front again we're continuing to push headcount lower than volume. I see us continuing to do that certainly for this coming year but also gearing up with service design efforts. And got a little new staffing and learning technology helping with that really looking at reducing overall train starts, looking at new train link initiatives. So -- and as Mike mentioned the asset utilization overall and cycle time. Seeing some improvement coming out of the year and going into next year. ","Fuel and fuel efficiencies I touched on and we saw some improvement this year. We really haven't gained as much of the benefit for the Mexico fuel efficiency technology. That hasn't been in play for much of 2017 so we should start to see a full benefit of that. And use of different and other and newer technologies as well. So hitting on your major fronts locomotors I have talked about as well. Again I think we're in a good spot on that and continuing to do the same from our active locomotive fleet that will come in short of the volume increases. So feel very good for continued efforts around all those three major areas.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, so it sounds like maybe the fuel upside is maybe the one of the sort of headwinds that you are calling out but it doesn\u2019t sound like there is much else you have going on from headwind perspective? ","Michael W. Upchurch","I would say just rising fuel prices is a headwind so forget about the -- well fear about the excise tax that even if we have 100% coverage of our fuel surcharge program, when you add incremental rising fuel costs and the offset is rising fuel surcharge revenue that is essentially 100% operating ratio impact on our overall performance. So rising fuel prices are going to be a headwind. We overcame that in the quarter and for the year but it's going to be a headwind for overall operating ratio performance. ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And Chris just a reminder, in my comments on the operating expense slide, I did indicate depreciation would be about 360 million next year so that's certainly a headwind and that our PTC expenses would be approximately 32 million that was split 18 million depreciation and 14 million labor. So that's up substantially from 2017 as PTC gets in serviced.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yeah, good morning. Let's see so just I guess following up on the prior question, does that equation lead you to meaningful operating ratio improvement it sounds like you have puts and takes in the cost side but obviously a very healthy volume outlook, so I mean is it reasonable to say 100 to 200 basis points of our improvement or how do you kind of without being specific on guidance give a directional comment on OR? ","Michael W. Upchurch","Well nice try Tom but we won't go to guidance. We do expect improvement in our operating ratio next year. We do think we have enough opportunities here to reduce costs and cover some of the incremental headwinds. We do have a very favorable outlook as Brian indicated on volumes and volume is a big driver in our business to continue to do improve our overall earnings. You just have to look at full year and fourth quarter 2017 results and see that delivering top line delivered some pretty solid earnings per share growth of 23% in the fourth quarter and 17% for the full year.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, great. So that -- for the -- my other question I appreciate the framework you gave us in the comments Pat on NAFTA, it's helpful to hear your perspective and I know you're really close to the pulse of what's happening there. I wanted to ask about I guess the secondary effect, so if maybe trade flows don't change a lot but the Peso has a significant step down if the U.S. withdraws from NAFTA I know this is all kind of hypothetical but how would you think about a significant step down in the Peso, I guess two different aspects, how it affects your competitive situation in Mexico versus truck? And also from the financials when you think about kind of locally generated income and you translate that in the Peso is weaker then that's the headwind but can you offer some thoughts on competitive impact, the weaker Peso, and then kind of financial impact as well?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Let me take a stab at answering that and then I'll ask Mike to talk about the financial impact. But as you know we've got kind of a natural hedge in terms of revenue and cost basically echoing each other and offsetting each other. So when the Peso declines we see a hit to revenue but we see also a reduction on the cost side that in the past has largely sort of offset each other. It's interesting if there's a withdrawal in NAFTA you could probably expect that the Peso is going to take a hit. As I mentioned if WTO tariffs apply they're actually higher for most of the export categories than they are for the import categories. But let's say there's an increase in tariffs on some of the NAFTA protected commodities. It wouldn't be surprising, I shouldn't say I would expect because my projections aren't worth that much but one would expect that maybe the reduction in the in the currency values would offset largely or maybe even more than offset the increase in tariffs. Don't forget when we were talking about a 20% border adjustment tax this time last year the Peso devalued by 25% so it was still cheaper to buy things in Mexico even if you assume that there was going to be a border adjustment tax. So capital markets and currencies have a lot of impact on what's going to happen with -- in the absence of a trade agreement or changes in the tariff structure. ","Michael W. Upchurch","Tom on the P&L impact, on slide 30 in our appendix we showed you the impacts of that. We do have a pretty natural hedge in the P&L. We benefited $2.4 million in the quarter on operating income, on reported operating income of 237.8 million. So it has a pretty negligible effect whether it's positive or negative in any quarter. I do find it interesting that as we look at our competitive situation in Mexico we did grow intermodal volumes in Mexico in the fourth quarter and our competitor did not. So I think we're doing a pretty good job holding our own. The other thing that I'll mention is not really covered on the slide that I talked about that another factor and probably maybe even the biggest factor is if there's a collapse in NAFTA, if there is a withdrawal the administration, the U.S. administration has said back from the very beginning that what they don't like multilateral agreements, they prefer bilateral agreements. ","So one would expect again that if there's a collapse or withdraw that the U.S. then begins to engage in or is open to bilateral agreements with Mexico. So the biggest kind of wild card and unknown here is how quickly is the U.S. and Mexico, are they able to get into a bilateral agreement that replaces NAFTA and what did the terms of that agreement look like, how does it differ than NAFTA. So we would expect that there will be some agreement between the U.S. and Mexico if NAFTA doesn\u2019t survive and the timing and the outcome and the impact of that agreement is obviously a bigger unknown than some of the other factors. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst ","Good morning, it is Dan Kegel [ph] on for Brandon, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask again about energy reform, it looks like after the significant development in 2Q last year to about 14 million a quarter run rate, how should we think about that going forward and be on the ramp of some of the storage in retail locations you talked about, could you talk about what markets in Mexico and open and closed today and if additional markets open there or when additional markets open, could we see another step function change in revenue in volume like we did last year? ","Brian Hancock","Sure Brandon, this is Brian. All of the markets in Mexico are open, all of the taxes have been taken off, all of the monopolistic type things that PEMEX had have been taken off. So, we are fully engaged in Mexico energy reform. So we are currently shipping to Mexico City to get [indiscernible] which is north of Mexico City. There's no market that we're not engaged in and trying to understand what the supply demand equation will look like.","Unidentified Analyst ","Appreciate that and then just as a quick follow-up, Mike could you clarify the comment on CAPEX side regarding locomotive purchases not being included in 2018? Are there leases there?","Michael W. Upchurch","We don't currently plan on purchasing any locomotives in 2018. If we do that will be a great story because we'll have exceeded our forecasted carload growth.","Unidentified Analyst ","Understood, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions. ","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning. I wanted to start with following up on the mix commentary earlier in the call, given the headwinds your expecting from intermodal and coal, is the message that consolidated mix will likely be negative in 2018 and RPU probably increases in that low single-digit range versus the mid single-digit range that we saw last year?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Justin I would say that the mix difference, I mean a significant piece of that will be the loss of that coal customer obviously. But when you think about intermodal, intermodal is going to impact us because we have more of a cross border freight. Now that has a lower RPU but we love that business. So it's a great business for us. So when you think about mix overall it potentially could have an impact on our RPU to the negative but it would be because the intermodal business is growing which would be a positive. So I don't want to -- I'm not sure exactly what your question was but we see very positive business mix, all of the markets growing except for that facility that we lost in Texas, that's all we are saying. ","Michael W. Upchurch","Justin, this is Mike. Just because we're going to lose the coal volume on that one customer and have some headline revenue per unit mix issues does not mean that's going to negatively impact our profitability. In fact the incremental margins on intermodal despite the much lower revenue per unit are quite good.","Justin Long","Okay, and maybe as my follow-up I can ask about incremental margins as well because I think historically you've talked about that number averaging somewhere in the mid 50's over time, is that still a good ballpark to be thinking about for 2018 or given the step up in PTC costs that you mentioned and depreciation and I guess a little bit lower number on the excise tax credit, could we be somewhat below that incremental margin framework? ","Michael W. Upchurch","No, our expectation are we will be above 50% on incremental margins. If you look at 2017 whether it's full year or the fourth quarter, I mean rising fuel prices have had a negative impact on the peer calculation of your incremental margin. If you look at it without fuel prices then we were well above 50%, I think 60% in the fourth quarter here. It's just you have 100% OR business when fuel prices grow that hurt your calculated operating ratio but our expectation is incremental margins above 50%.","Operator","Thank you, the next question today comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Ken Hoexter","Great, good morning. Mike or Pat, I guess you talked about CAPEX declines accelerating free cash flow given the earnings growth, you've got the buy back in place, I think Pat you mentioned you like where the leverage is now. What are the next steps for KSU as you start to generate incremental cash and is this a signal that maybe you expect slower growth if you're pulling back the CAPEX to down below four years in a row now or is there other steps that you can do with that incremental free cash?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Hey, I will chime in here because they can't help myself. No, the reduction in CAPEX does not reflect that we see lower growth. It's a function of completing some really major discrete capital projects and in the absence of new projects that come along that it certainly does not reflect that we feel different about the growth outlook or that the growth outlook is going to be weaker. ","Michael W. Upchurch","Ken remember we had $58 million spend related to Sasol in 2017 so if you pull that out you can actually conclude we've got a little bit of growth in our capital which is largely equipment to carry the incremental volumes that we think are going to be there in 2018","Ken Hoexter","And just to wrap up then on that same thing Mike, thoughts on what do you do with that cash, right you've got the buyback but -- and you mentioned leverage was good, is it all then focused on the buyback or where do you see the use of that cash? ","Michael W. Upchurch","Yeah, I think we fully intend to continue to execute our buyback program that the board approved in August. It was an $800 million program. We'll continue to execute that, we will continue to take a look at our dividend and see how the year plays out. I think it's -- in the 10 years I've been here absolute the best position that we've been and the most flexibility that we have. We have talked about potentially making some more investments in Mexico energy reform assets that would allow us to drive more revenue there. But we have a tremendous amount of flexibility. ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And I would say that we are more aggressive and more looking at different investments that could help drive growth on the railroad. The key ingredient I think is going to be things like these terminal projects in Mexico. Possibly transloads to support the plastics and petrochemicals business. We were looking at a lot of other alternatives including technology that could help drive growth of volume and revenues on the railroad. So we haven't included that in the CAPEX budget but I would say I would be disappointed over the course of the year if we don't have some things to talk about with you guys in terms of additional uses of capital that will help drive growth even further.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please proceed with your questions. ","Bascome Majors","Mike you talked about tax reform saving giving you an incremental 90 million in cash taxes over the next three years, but you also said that your cash tax rate was going to be 20% to 25% over that time frame and I think you've enjoyed something closer to the mid single-digits on a cash tax rate recently. Could you help us reconcile the absolute dollar savings with the rising cash tax rate and just maybe back up a little bit, give us a little better color on how your cash tax position changes over the next three years versus the last three? ","Michael W. Upchurch","Sure, yeah, great question and you're right we've had a nice low cash tax rate. We are paying cash taxes in Mexico. We have for the last couple years and we expect to pay higher cash taxes in Mexico. So that's the driver of the 20% to 25% range. As one of our Board Members has reminded me paying cash taxes is not necessarily a bad thing because it's a sign that we're making money. And you're going to just see a little bit of a step up in cash taxes paid in Mexico and that will be offset from a planning standpoint with a $90 million improvement over the next three years in the U.S. So net, net this is better for Kansas City Southern and we expect to pay lower cash taxes for the next three years.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks, good morning guys. So I don't know if anyone asked about COFECE can you just give an update on timing there if you still expect something in January and any expectation there and then just one more NAFTA question, can you just clarify that the total cross border exposure if you include business just moving on one side to the border?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","COFECE we now expect a final resolution in April. Apparently there were some delays in the process and now expect a decision in April instead of January. We don't have any new information or insight to share with you so not much of an update other than the deadline has been extended. I am not sure I understand your question about cross border. ","Scott Group","So, you guys talk about 30% of the businesses is cross border that only includes stuff where you're on both sides of the border. I'm just -- if you move something --?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I mean it could be 40% if you include the Union Pacific Interchange. ","Scott Group","Okay, perfect and then do you think -- do you view the COFECE delay as a good thing meaning it's taking longer, is it more likely than they're going to change their view? ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","No idea. We really -- it's just a process extension so we don't have any information from COFECE that would give us insight as to whether there -- the signal is any positive or negative sentiment. So, we really just don't have any new information other than the time line has been extended. ","Scott Group","Okay, makes sense and then Mike I want to just go back to the margin on -- ","Michael W. Upchurch","Go ahead and then we'll cut it off. ","Scott Group","Thank you, so you've talked about I think between depreciation in the fuel tax credit that's like 180 basis point headwind to margins and then fuel price is rising that had something, so call like a 2.0 plus margin headwind to overcome I'm struggling a little bit to get to margin improvement but you sound very confident that you get. So maybe what are some of the discrete tailwinds to overcome like that the 2.0 plus headwind? ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Well, I'll repeat what I said earlier which was labor productivity, fuel expenses, continued benefits from contracts that we've in sourced and renegotiated, equipment cycle times that have shown nice improvement over the year and then don't forget the fact that incremental margins on our carload growth will deliver nice improvement in operating ratio.","Okay, I think operator does that conclude our questions. ","Operator","Yes, please go ahead Mr. Ottensmeyer. ","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay, well thanks again for your attention and your questions. I will just recap some of the highlights, 23% earnings per share growth for the quarter, very solid performance across all four quarters of 2018 and I think most importantly we see 90% of our portfolio of commodities, of major business units seeing positive trends and results for 2018. So we are really very optimistic about the outlook for growth going forward. And I think on the operating ratio and performance side as well we're doing things. Jeff and the team are doing things that are very focused on producing productivity gains in an environment where we see volume growth, good pricing environment, and a very strong focus on productivity gains. There is absolutely no reason to expect that we won't see further improvement in operating ratio and good growth in earnings per share as well. So we're very positive on the outlook for 2018. Lot of factors obviously that we don't control that could be things that we have to deal with during the year. But as far as the core business and the position of the company right now we feel very good about where we're at and the outlook for the future. So thank you all for your participation and we'll see you in 90 days. ","Operator","Thank you. This will conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the Company which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of the Company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, filed with the SEC. The Company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, you may begin.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thank you very much and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 earnings call. Sorry for the brief delay here, but I will start on Page 4. You\u2019re familiar with the presenters, the same lineup that we\u2019ve had for the last several quarters, so I won\u2019t introduce everyone.","Moving on to Slide 5, you can see the results for the quarter in a very high-level summary. In spite of Mother Nature throwing us almost everything she had, we had a really terrific quarter with revenues increasing 9% on 3% volume growth, strength really in most of our business units. Operating ratio of 64.4%, which was a 250 basis point improvement from last year. I want to really talk about our performance during the quarter in spite of one of the strongest hurricanes and storms we\u2019ve seen in recent memory.","The performance of our operating team and Jeff will talk more about this in a couple of minutes. But the performance of the operating team to deal with the storm and put us in a position where we could recover very quickly. The resilience of our network, the condition of our infrastructure was also a factor in our ability to recover as quickly as you\u2019ll see in a minute. And also I want to mention the cooperation and the way the railroads work together during this situation was better than it has been in my memory.","Hurricane Harvey hit Corpus Christi on Friday. On Monday, I received a call from Lance Fritz, the CEO of Union Pacific, asking how we were doing, telling me what the condition of their network was and offering to help in anyway and encouraging us to stay in touch and work with each other, because at that point we didn\u2019t know how things were going to play out, because it was several more days before the rain actually stopped.","So, the level of communication and cooperation was just outstanding and it really helps not only with our recovery, but help keep our customers served well and made it possible for us to make the most of the situation. In fact, within a few days of that phone call, we were rerouting and detouring grain trains from Kansas City to Laredo to serve our Mexican customers.","So it kept us in business, kept our customer served and made it possible for us to recover much more quickly than we would otherwise. And finally, earnings per share of $1.23, on an adjusted basis $1.35, which on a comparable measure was 21% higher than last year.","Switching to Slide 6, it really shows the dramatic impact of the hurricane. You can see from the red line, excuse me, we were kind of checking along at 45,000 cars before the hurricane hit dropped off dramatically, and then bounced back really rather quickly, recovered some of the lost business, because while there was some modal shifting, as you may recall during this period, particularly around the immediate Houston, Beaumont-Port Arthur area, it wasn\u2019t just the railroads that were affected, it was the highways and the ports.","So there was limited ability for shippers to use other modes without significant additional mileage in longer reroutes. You can also see from the dotted line that we were moving along at about a 6% or 7% growth rate from the previous year. Before the hurricane hit in carloads, we obviously reported a 3% gain increase in volume, so we didn\u2019t get all of that back.","But the point is that, we were moving along at a very nice growth rate for the quarter until the hurricane hit and have recovered some of that, not all of it, Mike will talk more about the financial impact of the hurricane loss in a couple of minutes. But again a testament to the resilience of our network, the performance of our operating team, and the cooperation of the other railroads to help us minimize the impact of this on ourselves and on our customers.","So with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Songer, our Chief Operating Officer.","Jeffrey Songer","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. Reviewing the key operating metrics for the quarter on Slide, velocity has remained relatively consistent over the last several quarters, while Dwell for the quarter of 21.6 hours, improved 10% versus the same period last year.","Hurricane-related impacts to key operating metrics were minimized, as embargo and recovery activities kept our network from becoming overly congested. As experienced in other recent weather events, we partnered well with connecting railroads UP and BN to work through service interruptions that impacted the entire region.","Hurricane Harvey was different than prior events due to its longevity. The storm\u2019s initial landfall occurred on August 25 near Corpus Christi, at which time KSC outages were first reported. Over the next several days, multiple KCS, UP and BN routes were impacted as the storm traveled north, eventually stalling over Houston where some areas received more than 50 inches of rain.","As the storm progressed, tracks around Beaumont, Texas and into the Louisiana flooded on September 1, a full week after the storm\u2019s initial landfall. Once the rains and water levels subsided, we were able to assess and repair the damage. By September 9, all KCS tracks were restored to service.","Unrelated to Hurricane Harvey, other flooding impacts during the last week of September in Northern Mexico caused several days of impact to our cross-border traffic, which has been visible in early October operating metrics. We have now largely recovered from these events, and I would like to recognize our operating team for their tireless efforts during the quarter.","Aside from the weather impacts, Mexico terminals showed significant improvement over the prior year. As you recall last year, service disruptions in Mexico caused multiple days of outages across the network and inflated our dwell during that period. Overall improved operations, investments and capacity and cross-border initiatives continue to have positive impacts on our performance.","Turning to Slide 9, we continue our efforts to manage resources below volume, a 3% volume growth on 2% tinny headcount. I\u2019m pleased to announce that we have started PTC revenue service demonstration on the two subdivisions in the Louisiana. We have an aggressive PTC implementation scheduled for the rest of our U.S. network over the next several months, and are monitoring resources to minimize any disruption during this initiative.","Other highlights include the recent announcement of a new Health, Safety and Environmental group that will enhance our overall commitment to safety and will provide additional oversight for the safe movement of refined products as this opportunity grows.","Regarding the capital program, major track work at Sanchez is complete, and we have started to shift some operations from our Nuevo Laredo yard to the new Sanchez terminal. Additional investments in mechanical and fueling facilities at Sanchez will continue into 2018 and will continue to support our cross-border capacity.","The construction work at the new Sasol facility pictured here remains on schedule. We recently completed construction of the KCS terminal within the facility and the work at the adjacent Sasol tracks will be complete before the end of the year.","Other highlights include the opening of Unified Cargo Processing Center at Laredo. This joint effort by U.S. and Mexico customs allows for a single point of inspection for our northbound trains and is reducing the overall transit time it will reach. This month, we should also finalize an agreement for in-sourcing additional mechanical functions in Mexico. This initiative will reduce those costs by approximately $2 million annually ongoing.","Finally, I want to acknowledge those in Mexico who are affected by the recent earthquakes. While there was no damage to our infrastructure, we continue to support those families and businesses impacted by these events.","I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock.","Brian Hancock","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll start my comments on Page 11, where you can see third quarter year-over-year revenue was up 9% and volumes were up 3%.","As discussed by Pat, volume growth was negatively impacted by several weather events in Texas and Northern Mexico. Prior to these events, volumes were tracking at a growth rate of approximately 6%. For the quarter, same-store sales as well as in-quarter renewals pricing both came in at a solid 3%.","The Chemical & Petroleum business growth of 10% was primarily driven by, excuse me, by solid performance in our longer length of haul southbound LPG business, as well as our lubes and oils. This business was hardest hit by Hurricane Harvey, with the heaviest impacts being seen in the petroleum business, where customer facilities and refineries were shutdown several weeks due to flooding in Southeast Texas.","Our Industrial & Consumer business also showed improvement in the third quarter with revenue growth of 9% and an increase of volume of 4%. We continue to see strength in our military shipments and our metals business was also positive due to an increased need for pipe in the energy sector.","Once again this quarter, our energy line of business saw over 100% revenue growth in both frac sand and crude oil, driving an overall year-over-year revenue increase of 19% for the total energy business. We also saw an improved length of haul and attractive mix this quarter due to a larger percentage of the business having final destination in Texas.","The automotive business was up 19% over 2016, driven primarily by growth in the manufacturing capacity as new model launches began to take effect. Given the number of vehicles damaged in the hurricanes and the floods, lot of industry saw an increase in sales in September, but most of that demand were satisfied through existing dealer inventories.","As a result of this surge in demand, we are seeing a tightness in the automotive equipment across several regions of the North American rail network. Even with this tightness, we still expect to see solid performance in Q4 to fill this demand. We do not expect any impact from the storms outside of the third and fourth quarter of 2017.","Intermodal revenue and volume increases have improved to 4%, partly driven by new business and the new cross-border services. During the quarter, this business unit was definitely impacted by Hurricane Harvey, as well as the less publicized floods in Northern Mexico.","We continue to see a very competitive market due to low trucking rates in ocean shipping consolidation, but we\u2019re positioned very well to deal with the competition. There is also a tightening in the U.S. domestic intermodal business that has impacted some of our customers. We believe and are seeing we will continue to see solid in both \u2013 solid growth in both of our major cross-border service offerings, as well as freight coming into the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas as customers continue to look for alternative solutions for their supply chain.","The Agriculture & Minerals line of business revenue growth of 2% was primarily driven by grain demand. Our operating team did a fantastic job in conjunction with our partner carriers to due to much of the export grain shipments that were impacted by the flooding. The harvest looks strong for the fourth quarter and we expect to see continued strength in ag and minerals to close out the remainder of the year.","On Page 12, you can see an updated assessment of our fourth quarter 2017 volume outlook. As I mentioned, we expect to see our cross-border service offerings continue driving improvement in our intermodal business in the fourth quarter. We expect growth in our Chemical & Petroleum segment due to the additional refined product shipments and strengthening in the plastics market.","I want to remind everyone that the final transition date for the remaining regions impacted by Mexico Energy Reform will be November 30. We also announced during the third quarter, our planned investment in another storage and distribution terminal near Monterey that I\u2019ll discuss later in the presentation.","As I mentioned, the strong grain harvest will drive year-over-year fourth quarter Ag business, but at a slightly lower rate in 2016. This strength could be slightly tempered by volumes in our Food Products business through the end of the year. In Industrial & Consumer, we expect to see moderate year-over-year growth in both metals and paper.","Our outlook in military and cement moves remains uncertain, but if we continue to see the volumes similar to what we\u2019re seeing currently, then it\u2019s possible we\u2019ll have quarterly growth in this part of the business as well. Due to year-over-year change in plant shutdown schedules, our automated \u2013 our Automotive business will be facing tough year-over-year comps, but we\u2019re still expecting strong growth for the total year.","The challenge of the end of year plant schedules may be mitigated to some extent due to the heavy demand for replacement cars and trucks in the area impacted by hurricanes and earthquakes. Crude oil and frac sand shipments will remain strong in the fourth quarter, but year-over-year volumes in the utility coal market will create a difficult comp when compared to the second-half of 2016.","Moving to Slide 13, as I mentioned before, we announced the planned investment in refined products terminal in Salinas Victoria just north of Monterrey Mexico. This joint venture with Bulkmatic will continue to demonstrate our commitment to creating quality facilities in critical markets that allow us to provide rail service and growing refined products markets in Mexico.","This slide provides an update on our shipments in this important segment. Adjusted for the hurricane impact, we saw a 17% increase in volumes and refined fluids as well as LPG. LPGs continue to make up more than half the carload shift year-to-date. It\u2019s important to remember that growth in this business will come in stair steps. The first portion coming after all the facilities are open, and the second, a larger step will come after construction of the storage tanks is complete in the second-half of 2018.","On Slide 14, we have included a diagram that provides a visual of the KCS network, the important new terminals on our line and the existing pipeline systems for both refined products as well as LPG. As you can see, our investments are strategically located in to serve major population centers and growth areas that are not close to existing pipeline. The diagram also shows that almost the entire pipeline system is already running near capacity levels. Given the difficulty of acquiring land as well as topographical and security challenges of building new pipelines, we believe the strategic investments give us a significant foothold in this new and developing infrastructure.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Michael Upchurch","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m going to start my comments on Slide 16. Despite the Hurricane, third quarter volumes increased 3% and reported revenues increased 9%. Operating ratio improved from 66.9% to 64.4%, despite the loss of significant operating income due to the hurricane.","However, helping year-over-year comparisons was lower incentive compensation expense of $6 million, or about 90 basis points. Operating income improved $34 million, or 17%, and our incremental margin was approximately 65%, reflecting good expense management and productivity.","Reported EPS was $1.23, a 10% increase over third quarter 2016, while adjusted EPS was $1.35, a 21% increase over 3Q 2016. And our reconciliation from reported to adjusted EPS can be found on Slide 27 in the appendix. So overall, we were quite pleased with the third quarter results, which were achieved despite experiencing significant negative impact on the quarter from Hurricane Harvey.","Moving to Slide 17, let me briefly cover the estimated impacts from Hurricane Harvey. First, we believe the loss margin from traffic that is either permanently lost to customer production outages, or that moved under alternative modes of transportation is in the range of $19 million to $23 million.","As you saw in the slide that Pat reviewed, our traffic prior to the hurricane was increasing at approximately 6% over the prior year. And after getting our network and equipment back to normal operating levels, we are now growing carloads again at the same pre-hurricane level.","In addition to lost operating income from business interruption, we also incurred incremental operating expenses related to detour costs, property damage and other operational disruptions that totaled approximately $7 million. We will be filing a claim under our property insurance policy and accordingly are permitted under GAAP to record an offsetting receivable for those incremental expenses in the third quarter P&L.","While our third quarter estimated impact from Hurricane Harvey is a negative 140 to 160 basis points to operating ratio, or $0.12 to $0.14 per share, GAAP does preclude us from recording additional estimated insurance recoveries, which are in essence contingent gains until we have final resolution of the claim. And we would expect that to occur sometime in the back-half of 2018. Accordingly, we don\u2019t expect the net impact of the hurricane to be about $0.05 or less, once the claim is finalized.","Turning to Slide 18, operating expenses increased $18 million, or 4% over a year ago to $423 million, demonstrating good cost control. Key drivers of expense variances were fuel prices in Mexico in the U.S., which increased $6 million and $3 million, respectively, volume-related fuel increases of $3 million, reduced fuel excise tax credits of $5 million, depreciation increases of $5 million, wage inflation of $4 million and then reduced incentive compensation of $6 million.","I\u2019ll cover the key expense variances in the next few slides, but do want to point out several expense saving initiatives, such as favorable equipment expenses on a year-over-year basis, which were partly the result of reduced cycle times in Mexico and the mechanical in-sourcing and contract restructuring, which also saved $2 million in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 19, compensation and benefits expense increased $1 million, or approximately 1%, largely due to the year-over-year decline in incentive comp, the benefit of our year-over-year OR by about 90 basis points. Excluding the incentive comp benefit, expense would have increased approximately 5%; wage inflation added $4 million of expense; increased headcount, excluding the mechanical in-sourcing added $ million in expense; and mechanical in-sourcing also contributed $2 million in compensation expense.","And importantly, our overall headcount including the in-sourcing, excluding the in-sourcing of a mechanical vendor facility increased 2% below our volume growth, increased compensation expense of $6 million due to wage inflation and increased headcount was essentially offset by the $6 million year-over-year benefit in incentive compensation.","Turning to Slide 20, fuel expense increased $12 million, or 18%. Increasing fuel prices in both the U.S. and Mexico contributed $9 million to that increase. Higher consumption also increased fuel expense as we experienced a 3% carload increase and a 6% GTM increase. Our guidance for fuel tax credits in Mexico is being reduced from the $45 million to $50 million range to $42 million to $45 million as rising fuel prices have caused the Mexican government to reduce the fuel excise tax rate.","We do believe the fuel excise tax will continue to 2018 and beyond, and that that railroads in Mexico will continue to benefit as a wholesale user of fuel by being exempt from those excise taxes similar to the U.S. fuel excise tax system.","Turning to Slide 21, purchase service expenses declined mainly from savings we achieved from the mechanical in-sourcing and contract restructuring, which decreases expense by $10 million. And materials and other increased $5 million, primarily due to materials and supplies required for the mechanical in-sourcing.","Finally, as I discussed earlier, we recorded a $7 million receivable from our insurance carriers that offset $7 million in incremental expense due to property damage, detour costs and other operational disruptions.","And finally, on Slide 22, turning to our capital allocation priorities, we continue to be focused on growing our business faster than our competitors, something we have consistently achieved since 2007, growing our overall carload volumes by 22%, while the rest of the Class 1 railroads have declined by 3%.","As Jeff indicated earlier, our CapEx guidance continues to be in the $550 million to $560 million range for 2017, which will be the third year in a row of declining capital spend. In addition to the capital expenditures, we\u2019re projecting to invest approximately $37 million in 2017 and $24 million in 2018 by partnering with others to invest in rail served, refined liquid terminals in Mexico to capture the Mexican Energy Reform opportunity that Brian discussed. And these will be accounted for as equity method investments, not as capital expenditures.","Our management team and Board of Directors are committed to continuing our practice of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Accordingly, our Board approved an $800 million share repurchase program on August 15 at a 9% increase in our common stock dividend.","During the third quarter, we purchased 1.75 million shares of our common stock under an accelerated purchase program with two financial institutions at an average price of $105.70. And the remaining 150,000 shares under this program were settled in early October, thus completing the $200 million accelerated repurchase program.","And finally, from a capital structure, we\u2019re very comfortable with our credit profile and debt levels, having secured the lowest weighted average interest rate in the Class 1 space at 3.9%. And with a leverage ratio of 2.2, our credit metrics are as good as or better than most of our peers rated BBB+.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Pat.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll just make a couple of quick comments before we open it up. I want to go back to Slide 17 that Mike covered and just want to make sure and sort of reiterate what Mike emphasized on this slide.","This slide only shows the impact of the hurricane. Obviously, there are other factors positive and negative that took place during the quarter. So it would not be correct for you to extrapolate that our operating ratio would have been 140 or 160 basis points or better in the quarter without the hurricane. Again, there were other factors that were not reflected in these numbers on Slide 17.","And just really again, the past few quarters, I\u2019ve given you suggestions for the headline to your research updates, very strong quarter, amazing resilience and just outstanding performance. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased and proud of the operating team in the way we got support from the other railroads during Hurricane Harvey.","Harvey was the headline obviously and the biggest impact that both Jeff and Brian mentioned flooding in Northern Mexico that didn\u2019t get so much coverage in the press that occurred after Harvey that really did slow us down in terms of recovering and getting back in business, particularly for cross-border traffic. And some of that will impact our operating metrics on into the first week or so of the fourth quarter.","So in spite of \u2013 as I said at the beginning, in spite of Mother Nature throwing us almost everything she had, we just overcame that and had a very strong quarter, record operating income, record operating ratio for the third quarter.","I also know that NAFTA has been in the headlines this week, and I\u2019m sure there are a lot of questions about that. We still just don\u2019t have answers as to how this is all going to wrap up and conclude. There has been a delay in the process in the pace of the negotiations. We actually think that\u2019s a \u2013 not a bad thing.","And as I \u2013 I was in Washington for three days this week during \u2013 when the negotiations were taking place. And the explanation that I heard about the reason for the delay was not attributable to the negotiations deteriorating or collapsing, it was really this round included much more specific detailed proposals.","And it\u2019s just going to take longer for all sides to analyze and asses what the impact of those proposals are. And they felt that it was appropriate to delay the next \u2013 the timing of the next round, so that all parties could make those assessments and before they get together again.","So we don\u2019t have solid answers, but obviously, the process is continuing and all parties are still at the table, which is good. And we just don\u2019t know yet what the impact is going to be.","So with that, I will open the call up to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will be now conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Due to the number of participants on this morning\u2019s call, management will limit your question to one primary question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. Congrats on working around the hurricane and the performance.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Yes.","Ken Hoexter","Brian, you mentioned some low truck rates in your opening \u2013 in your prepared remarks. I presume that you were talking about Mexico intermodal given the decline of peso. So maybe you can kind of just fill us in on how business is trending given the decline of the peso on intermodal side and compare and contrast that with the strength you might be seeing in the U.S. given the tight truck market?","Brian Hancock","Yes, absolutely, Ken, thanks for the question. Definitely, I was talking about Mexico. The truck rates in Mexico continue to stay low, continued relatively cheap equipment and fuel, very competitive specifically into the Mexico City market, but we\u2019re positioned well. We\u2019re seeing great volumes off of the L\u00e1zaro terminal, also inter-Mexico, like I said, the cross-border is working very, very well.","As you mentioned, we are seeing significant price increases in the domestic space, which allows \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of things that happen there specifically for our market basically between Dallas and Atlanta, that\u2019s a fairly competitive market. And so as those truck rates go up and as intermodal rates go up, obviously it\u2019s positive for us, because we\u2019re able to get more freight on the railroad.","So we think intermodal is positioned well. We think it\u2019s maybe coming out of that pricing funk that it\u2019s been in for the last few years. And so we continue to believe, intermodal is going to be a great benefit going forward.","Ken Hoexter","Great. And then if I could have my highlight, Jose, if you\u2019re still on the line just to get his thoughts on the COFECE timing and the sustainability of the tax benefit on the Mexican side?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Jose, are you there?","Michael Upchurch","No.","Ken Hoexter","Okay.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Sorry, Jose is not there. No change on the COFECE process. There\u2019s really been no change. We\u2019re still expecting a conclusion in January. And there really hasn\u2019t been any dialogue or indication privately or publicly as to an update, so we just don\u2019t have anything to say there. And I think, Mike covered the \u2013 are you talking about the excise tax? We just don\u2019t see any evidence or any reason to think that that\u2019s not going to be a permanent benefit.","Michael Upchurch","Yes, Ken, this is Mike. I mean, at the end of the year, we\u2019ll know for sure about our ability to get the credit. But this excise tax has been in place for 30 years in Mexico. It\u2019s no different than the U.S., where we pay excise taxes on fuel, it\u2019s just the realization of that benefit, is slightly different in the U.S. We buy wholesale and don\u2019t have to incur it at the time of purchase.","In Mexico, we do have to pay it and then get a credit through our withholding taxes or income taxes. But net-net, the systems really aren\u2019t any different in Mexico than they are in the U.S.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Good morning, guys. I also want to say how heartening it was to hear about the two railroads really working together when times get tough, so that\u2019s a nice note. I wanted to focus a little bit on some of the revenue per carload numbers. I thought automotive was up a little bit more than we\u2019ve been modeling. Was that just a mix issue in the quarter, or did some business reprice?","Brian Hancock","No, I would say, it\u2019s a mix issue exactly, Jason. There\u2019s no repricing happened in the quarter.","Jason Seidl","Okay. And going forward, if we exclude Mexican intermodal, because obviously, the truck rates down there are different than what\u2019s going on in the U.S. Overall, you guys \u2013 would you say the pricing environment is improving for the roads as you look out?","Brian Hancock","Jason, I would say that the pricing environment right now is relatively positive and strong. We continue to believe it will be inflation plus on both sides of the border. There\u2019s really no change in that. We are seeing some change in some of the markets in the U.S.","I would tell you, I think that the pricing in the refined products market has kind of stabilized. And I think everybody kind of is seeing how that\u2019s going to play out. So we feel very comfortable that it\u2019s a good solid pricing environment and we\u2019ll continue to expect inflation plus.","Jason Seidl","All right. Those are my two. Thank you so much for the time.","Brian Hancock","Thanks.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thanks, Jason.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","Hi, good morning. So it sounds like the Intermodal partnership with BN has seen some good early success. I was wondering if you could help us size the volume opportunity here longer-term, if you\u2019re seeing any developments with IMC partners to build out density in the broader \u2013 cross-border franchise?","And then lastly, how quickly do you think you can move the needle in terms of rail market share versus truck at the border?","Brian Hancock","Thanks, Allison. Again, this is Brian. That\u2019s a great question. And what I would tell you is, from a market share perspective, we still have very little market share there as the number of containers coming across the border is around 3% to 4%. And so you think about upside, there\u2019s significant upside in converting that freight from the road to the rail.","What I would tell you is, we are extremely pleased with the business. We just had a review this week with our partners BNSF and both groups are very pleased with what\u2019s happened. We feel very comfortable that it\u2019s going to grow. There\u2019s a lot of interest. We also see the exact same thing with the UP, our partner in the automotive business and some of our other intermodal.","So the IMCs are focused. They understand the opportunity. It doesn\u2019t take much to understand it, just go stand at the border and look at the 16,000 trucks trying to cross every day, it\u2019s a great opportunity for us. And I think, as Jeff mentioned, he mentioned the kind of quietly in his comments, he mentioned the joint facility between Mexican and U.S. customs.","If we\u2019re able to get that time at the bridge down like he\u2019s really working hard on, that\u2019s going to be a great benefit to the intermodal as well as the carload customer. So we think it\u2019s going to be a good space.","Allison Landry","Okay. And then just as my follow-up question on Sasol. So, the terminal close to completion, how should we be thinking about the ramp in carloads in 2018? And do you have any incremental visibility into how much you could move single haul for exports through L\u00e1zaro? And then if you just had any other initial thoughts on the petrochemical volume opportunity in general as we look forward, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Sure. What I would tell you is, Jeff and his team, as he mentioned, are going to complete the Sasol yard here in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s a beautiful yard as the picture showed. What I would tell you is, I think Sasol has already announced that they will begin operations in the second-half of 2018, and we concur with them. We\u2019re working daily with them to make sure that they have proper support, how that will ramp up and how that will turn into carloads, you probably have to talk to Sasol about that, because obviously the facility is theirs.","What I would tell you is, we\u2019re very excited about the continued growth of the crackers on the Gulf Coast, not only for volume within the U.S., but volume through L\u00e1zaro. We don\u2019t really have projected volumes for those yet into 2018. But they\u2019re certainly going to ramp up next year and then it\u2019ll continue to grow as that \u2013 as those facilities get built out and the capacity comes online. So it\u2019s going to be a gradual ramp up, but we\u2019re focused on it and all of our partners are focused on it, it\u2019s a big opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Diane.Huang","Hi, this is Diane on Ravi\u2019s team. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is, you estimated about $0.12 to $0.14 of EPS impact from lost revenue due to the hurricane this quarter and the third quarter. Can you estimate how much of the $0.12 to $0.14, do you think you can recover in the fourth quarter, or was the majority of that announced permanent in nature? Thanks.","Michael Upchurch","This is Mike Upchurch. No, we can\u2019t do that. We haven\u2019t filed a claim with the insurance companies yet to establish the total loss. That will take probably another 30 days or so. You have to appreciate the amount of detail that we have to go through in terms invoices and customer carload lost. We do think we\u2019re going to get a recovery here that will be booked at a later date, but it\u2019s not going to be in the fourth quarter. I indicated that would be in the back-half of 2018, and just appreciate how many claims the insurance companies are dealing with right now, given the two major hurricanes and other issues around the world like the earthquake in Mexico. So it\u2019s going to take some time to work through that.","Diane.Huang","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And my follow-up is, in the call you guys said, there were other factors that were not reflected in Slide 17. And so can you talk about the other tailwinds or headwinds that you guys found in the quarter? And if any of these trends will continue going forward?","Michael Upchurch","On Slide 17 related to the hurricane?","Diane.Huang","Yes. You guys said there were also other factors?","Michael Upchurch","Well, we had things like detour costs that we had to incur. Pat mentioned that we were detouring a lot of trains over Union Pacific and still getting those into Mexico. There were car hire expenses that were incurred, because the equipment is sitting idle.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I think, what I was referring to in my kind of summary comments was things unrelated to the hurricane. So this slide only reflects the impact of the hurricane. It doesn\u2019t include other things like incentive comp and other things that occurred during the quarter. So my statement was that it would be incorrect to assume that, our operating ratio would have been 140 to 160 basis points better absent the hurricane.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, thanks. Good morning. So you mentioned earlier time on the bridge is going to go down with some of the cross-border initiatives that you\u2019re working on. To help the speed, but what about balancing out the network flow going north and south? And maybe you could just comment on the addition of APM terminal and BNSF service, if that\u2019s really affected it? And is there something you might have to add your own equipment or containers down the line to help rebalance and perhaps solve that challenge?","Jeffrey Songer","This is Jeff, Let me start, and then I\u2019ll probably turn it to Brian for APM comments. So the new cargo processing center is currently only working on northbound flow. The desire is that we pilot this for a period of time and then we do this same action on the southbound flow. And I think customs is very supportive of what we\u2019re trying to do here and certainly we\u2019re showing. I think Laredo was the only border in the country on the south border that truck rail airlines have this kind of unified cargo processing application.","So again, I would look for hopefully early into next year that we\u2019re able to execute the same activity on the southbound. So that being said, I don\u2019t view that this is a bad thing or a thing that\u2019s going to create some kind of an imbalance. I look at the overall time spent on the bridge and every minute we can shave on off the train would allow you to maybe shift the time.","We currently work under a window structure at the bridge. So maybe if the northbound is flowing more fluidly, you shorten the time for those windows and you expand the time for the southbound. So again, it\u2019s a positive, no matter how you look at it, and I think, we\u2019ll continue to see some benefit on southbound trains early in \u2013 into next year.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","This has \u2013 I\u2019ll chime in here as well. This has been one of the important elements of our discussion with lawmakers and policymakers on both sides of the border as a possible update modernization of NAFTA. If we\u2019re going to take advantage of the opportunities that we see in the next three, five-plus-years, specifically refined products and plastics for export growth from the U.S. to Mexico, we really need to change the process that the trains have to go through to cross the border. That\u2019s a lot better, easier, cheaper solution than building another bridge, which is probably $1 billion plus project in five to more years. So if we can change the process in this cargo inspection facility is one of the key elements of that. We feel that we can significantly improve and increase the capacity at the bridge from what\u2019s currently possible.","Michael Upchurch","Brian, I don\u2019t know if you want me to say anything more about the balance. Obviously, Maersk, all of our IMCs, all of the container operators, I mean we\u2019re all very focused on making sure we stay balanced. There is a lot of freight moving south, a lot of export volume and refined products and plastics come in. But there are many teams working on this across the transportation network. And so we\u2019re very focused on as well as Jeff. So nothing more to say on that.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay understood. Just a quick one for you, Brian, the follow-up on that LGP opportunity, you\u2019ve heard a lot about refined products and the lack of storage, a couple of days storage on hand in terms of demand in Mexico. But I haven\u2019t heard too much about LPGs, you can just give us an overview on maybe the relative market opportunity there, that\u2019s bigger in terms of your current volume base, is that expected to stay that way? Do you have to make more investments in other terminals to help that continue?","Brian Hancock","Yes, great question, Brian. What I would say is the LPGs have been surprising to us how quickly it picked up. And bringing those LPGs into Mexico obviously it\u2019s used in almost every home in Mexico. And so the storage facilities are being created in most of the major population centers. But what I would tell you is, we\u2019re going to continue to see that business grow as well.","I think refined products will probably grow a little bit faster now, because LPG has really got a quick start out of the gate. But it\u2019s going to continue to grow significantly as again that\u2019s one where they do not have enough from a national supply perspective and you\u2019re seeing already facility is being constructed in the San Luis Potos\u00ed area, obviously in Salinas, Monterey. So it\u2019s going to continue to grow as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with the question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, great. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to stick on the refined products for a minute. So you\u2019ve had, I guess a couple of quarters under your belt of sort of improvement and growth there. I just wanted to get a sense if you sort of look into 2018, you have sort of better sense of maybe what the opportunity could be like for next year?","I think you highlighted a couple of individual investment opportunities for you, as well as other folks down in Mexico on the storage side and we kind of have the timing of that beginning to take shape. I was wondering if you could kind of help us put some numbers and thoughts around what the opportunity could look like for you either in 2018 or 2019?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Chris, I think that\u2019s the million-dollar question obviously is how fast is this going to ramp up? I think the keys for is we watch are going to be primarily a couple of things.","First off, the instance of new retailers into the market, how quickly that happens, how quickly the infrastructure from a retail perspective occurs. Second is going to be the distributors that are currently in place, how do they play from a storage perspective, as well as distribution into these new retailers. And then third, what is the infrastructure off of the ports, off of other facilities coming out of Texas, right now it appears that the big Texas facilities are going to be around Beaumont area, around Corpus Christi and then into the center of the country across a number of different items.","So we expect it to ramp up significantly from a retail perspective. Starting in 2018, a number of firms have already announced their plans and how big that will be. How quickly that actually plays itself out? I don\u2019t know. If you look at the expectations from a storage perspective, you have about 10 years for the country to gain that that significant storage capacity they were looking at of adding 10, 15 days of supply.","But we think here in 2018, you\u2019re going to see some pretty significant volumes, not only in off of the ports, but also out of the rail line. Again, I think the pipelines are pretty full, they\u2019re almost at capacity. So I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be significant movement on that space. So we\u2019re very positive about how it will impact this in 2018 forward, but the ramp up is going to be really tied to the retail \u2013 the new retailers.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then maybe sticking on this topic and sort of bringing NAFTA into the discussion, I think, it\u2019s probably one of the more interesting sort of dynamics within the whole NAFTA sort of headline risk relative to investments are actually occurring for some of this cross-border opportunities.","So when you\u2019re talking to your partners and other people who are getting involved in this trade, even in just the last couple of weeks, I don\u2019t know, Pat, if you have some perspective on this? How is sort of this NAFTA sort of risk playing into the discussion? Is it slowing anything down? Is that something that people are talking about? I just want to get some perspective \u2013 some real-word perspective on that?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","It\u2019s really not slowing anything down. In terms of business, I think, I said this in the past, we don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. So, are there projects and investments that have been thought about by industrial companies that have been delayed, things that haven\u2019t been announced.","My sense is, yes, waiting to see kind of what the outcome is. But as far as refined products and other opportunities, even steel, we had a great meeting a few weeks ago, a couple of weeks ago with one of our large steel companies that forging ahead and building out a presence in Mexico based on what they see in terms of automotive growth.","So, we have to continue to build out the capacity and make the investments that we\u2019re making to support our customers. As you know, these types of investments take a long time to build and with permitting and land acquisition and just the size and scale of the types of projects we invest in.","So we\u2019re forging ahead to be ready for the growth and to serve our customers based on the best information that we have as to what\u2019s going to happen. So \u2013 and we\u2019re spending a lot of time. I mentioned, I was in Washington for three days this week, talking about and trying to make sure as many people as we can touch, understand that there\u2019s a huge opportunity right in front of us for export growth in the form of refined products and plastics in addition to ag and other commodities that we move that I think will be very helpful and significant in reducing the trade deficit, which is what the negotiating team seems to be primarily focused on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question, and likely congrats on operating through a pretty difficult period.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Thank you.","Brandon Oglenski","So, Pat, I mean, I want to come back to the question from Diane earlier, and you called attention to it as well in your closing remarks here. Are you inferring that there were some positive or negative offsets in the quarter in your comments about how it\u2019s not just the hurricane impact you need to look at for what our OR could have been?","Michael Upchurch","Hey, Brandon, this is Mike Upchurch. Imagine, once you get the script, you\u2019ll be able to see my comments. But I think a couple of times I referenced that we had a 90 basis point year-over-year benefit as a result of lower incentive compensation. So I think you would have to net that against 140 to 160 basis point impact of the hurricane.","So net-net, you\u2019re probably looking at 50 to 70 basis points that our OR could have been better in the third quarter, had we not have this hurricane event, hopefully that helps.","Brandon Oglenski","Yes, I\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re probably just at a slow speed here in Friday. So I want to ask \u2013 I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about coal over the years. But we\u2019ve gotten the indications that you\u2019re going to see another coal shutdown in your network or potentially. Can you guys talk through what that impact could conceptually be? And do you think that it\u2019s actually going to shutdown this time, or what\u2019s the outlook there?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","I\u2019ll take that one. The answer is, no. We\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve obviously done internal sensitivities and sort of scenarios looking at the possible \u2013 the range of possible outcomes. But we\u2019re not going to get into detail on those, because we don\u2019t want to get ahead of the process. This isn\u2019t the first time that we\u2019ve seen this. And until we know what ERCOT \u2013 what the outcome of the current process is, we really don\u2019t feel it\u2019s appropriate to comment and quantify what the impact could be.","We don\u2019t think it\u2019s material. And you\u2019ll see when we file our financial statements in 10-Qs later on the disclosure in the 10-Q. We don\u2019t think, it\u2019s material. And until we know what the facts are, we\u2019re just not going to spend a lot of time talking about the volume, revenue or earnings impact. It\u2019s not out of the question, and I don\u2019t want to sound naive and foolish here.","But it\u2019s not out of the question that ERCOT will step in and say, this is critical infrastructure and we will support you and that could actually be positive to volumes. So until we know what the outcome is going to be, we\u2019re just going to let the process work. And when we know what the facts are, we\u2019ll deal with it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group","So, Mike, I just wanted to go back to some of the math on the hurricane. So the $19 million to $23 million of operating margin impact, what\u2019s the revenue loss and then what\u2019s the assumed margin on that? And then are you trying to suggest that, if we take \u2013 add back the $0.13 and call it a core earnings maybe at $1.48, that that\u2019s sort of the starting point to use for, I guess fourth quarter, because fourth quarter is usually pretty similar with third. Is that sort of what we\u2019re trying to say here?","Michael Upchurch","Well, on the first question that you have related to the revenues, I indicated, we \u2013 we\u2019re still going through a lot of quantification and contacts with our customers what was permanently lost. We\u2019re not going to provide any additional color on it other than to say a lot of it was cross-border traffic. We were embargoed at the border for what just 10 days or thereabouts.","Jeffrey Songer","Well, and beyond that as we went into recovery.","Michael Upchurch","Yes.","Jeffrey Songer","So multiple weeks of it.","Michael Upchurch","So there\u2019s little better revenue per unit associated with that cross-border traffic there. And Scott, I don\u2019t recall your second question that was on operating ratio?","Scott Group","No, it\u2019s not about operating ratio. Just so, I guess, you\u2019re calling up $0.13 from the hurricane. So if we say, hey, then the quarter could have been $1.48, is that sort of how you would think about fourth quarter, which is typically pretty similar with third? Is that a good starting point, obviously, that\u2019s well above where the street is. I just wanted to understand if that\u2019s sort of the message here?","Michael Upchurch","No, we\u2019re not providing that guidance. All we\u2019re saying is, third quarter was off to a great start. We were really looking at a blowout quarter prior to the hurricane and had some negative impacts on that. So we\u2019re not necessarily guiding to fourth quarter.","Scott Group","No, I understand. But is that a reasonable way to think about this a starting point?","Michael Upchurch","We\u2019re not guiding to the fourth quarter.","Scott Group","Fair enough. Okay. And then just for you, Brian, on auto. So flat volumes in the fourth quarter, is that a timing issue or in any way a change in how you guys think about the auto growth opportunity right now? And then do you have any view, if there is a change in NAFTA that requires more U.S. parts? What the \u2013 I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a positive opportunity for your item of moving more parts down, but any thoughts there?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Scott, I would tell you that, we don\u2019t have really any idea where it will end up. We know that what the proposals have been from a part and content perspective, deal content. What I would tell you is, there are \u2013 there is a little bit of a change in the downtime scheduling around Christmas that impacts us and 2017 and that might be some of the changes, just a calendaring space and how the calendar work for those particular plants.","But overall, we\u2019re very positive in our automotive business. And we continue to believe that no matter what happens. Mexico is going to be a great place to build vehicles for the world, and that\u2019s going to have content from all over the world and we\u2019re going to be a part of it. So we\u2019re \u2013 we continue to be very positive on our automotive business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks, and good morning. So I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but could you talk about what core pricing was in the quarter? And as we think about this tightening truckload market that we\u2019ve seen since, call it June, how long does it typically take for a pickup like this to start driving in acceleration of pricing on your rail network?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Justin, this is Brian. Our core pricing was 3% that\u2019s both in renewals and in the what\u2019s\u2026.","Michael Upchurch","Same-store?","Brian Hancock","The same-store, I\u2019m sorry, I was thinking about the second part of your question. When you think about the intermodal space, obviously those bids go out for the large customers, they go out sometime in the first quarter. And so it takes a while to see that. What you\u2019re talking about is the spot market of intermodal that impacts both truck pricing and intermodal pricing in probably that spot market, let\u2019s say, the top 20% or that piece that\u2019s flexible during the search periods of the year. That\u2019s not going to impact us as much as it would our intermodal carriers.","And so, we\u2019re primarily into that bid season in the fourth quarter, first part of first quarter, and then that\u2019s when we would see the pricing improvements. But obviously, it\u2019s going to be a benefit to us as truck pricing continues to go up and gives us some pricing power, as well as intermodal becomes a better option for some of those people who had products on the road. So it usually takes a full cycle of bids from an intermodal perspective on that.","Justin Long","Okay great. That\u2019s really helpful. And maybe secondly, I was curious if you could comment on crude by rail. It seems like, there\u2019s a little bit more optimism in Canada recently. So I was wondering, if you\u2019re seeing any increased activity around moving Western Canadian crude down to the Gulf. And just from a capacity standpoint, could you talk about your ability to handle a pickup in this market if it materializes?","Brian Hancock","Yes. First off, we are seeing a little bit more movement. As I mentioned, we saw over 100% increase, but that\u2019s from a pretty low number, basically hardly anything in the third quarter last year. Our capacity to move the Canadian crude or crew coming from anywhere is, we have plenty of capacity. There\u2019s plenty of equipment, and Jeff is ready to move it when people are ready to move it. Obviously, the spreads create an environment where the market can change overnight.","But we\u2019re seeing some positive signs in crude by rail and we\u2019re going to continue to take advantage of it when possible. And but we\u2019re not going to say, boy, this is going to come on like gangbusters, but if it does, nobody would be happier than Jeff Songer, because he\u2019s ready to move with when they bring it to him.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. I was wondering if Pat or Brain, you could offer some thoughts on, you\u2019ve got, it seems like quite a few headwind, or excuse me, tailwinds when you look at volume growth over the next couple of quarters maybe into 2018. I guess there\u2019s some potential headwinds in terms of coal, maybe some other things. But do you think there\u2019s good chance that we see, or a better chance that we see acceleration volumes looking over the next couple of quarters when you consider some of those tailwinds, or would you say it, it\u2019s kind of more likely that we stay kind of stabilization as we think of single-digit volume growth? Just looking for some kind of broader perspective on that?","Brian Hancock","Yes, Tom, I \u2013 I\u2019ll take. This is Brian. Here\u2019s what I would tell you, we are very, very focused on doing this in a rational, competent way in building out infrastructure and building out the Sasol Yard, the Sanchez Yard, these two terminals, that\u2019s all infrastructure which allows us to take advantage of markets that are coming that we can see. That volume is going to come on in a ramp environment. We\u2019re going to continue to see it grow again as retail markets change, as NAFTA is renegotiated, that will have a big impact on steel.","We are focused on creating fluidity and capacity in Mexico across the border and in the U.S., both in intermodal terminals, track, everything else. And so we\u2019re going out in a very rational way in a way that allows us to take advantage of markets. We\u2019re not making big jumps into anything that might be a swing in the marketplace. But we do \u2013 we see great growth in Mexico, great growth in Southeast Texas and along the Gulf Coast with the crackers and others.","So it\u2019s going to take time. It\u2019s going to ramp up in a way that we think we can take advantage of it. But we are spending our infrastructure dollars to make sure we\u2019re fluid and we have the capacity to get it when it comes.","Tom Wadewitz","Do you want to offer a thought on that Pat, whether it accelerates or?","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Well, I think, I\u2019ll just say at this time. I think we are extremely well positioned for good growth for years ahead, whether it accelerates from current levels, again go back to what we said earlier, prior to Hurricane Harvey hitting, we were up about 6% during the quarter and we\u2019ve kind of gotten back to that level since we\u2019ve reopened. But if you just look at our network and you look at the investment, you look at the opportunities in refined products and we kind of stop talking about the other aspects of Mexican Energy Reform in terms of exploration production.","The Eagle Ford, South of the Rio Grande, we still think that\u2019s an opportunity that hasn\u2019t occurred yet because of pricing and other factors. But automotive, intermodal, plastics, those plants are $165 billion or $170 billion of capacity and more to come, all taking place in the U.S. Gulf Coast. And every one of those plants even those that we don\u2019t touch physically, we\u2019ll have opportunities either with intermodal or other ways to serve those plants. And we\u2019re just extremely well positioned for growth for years to come.","The infrastructure is in great condition. And I feel like \u2013 and they\u2019re obviously factors outside of our control that are going to be things we have to deal with and adjust, but we\u2019re very optimistic about the outlook for growth for years to come.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, that\u2019s great. I appreciate it. And just a follow on. It sounds like you\u2019ve made a lot of investments to handle the growth you expect to be coming from a, I guess, the train schedule perspective if I consider BN, it would seem like you\u2019re running probably pretty substantially shorter train, and you could see operating leverage on those. Just kind of broadly speaking, would you expect to see strong operating leverage on the areas where you expect growth in 2018 and beyond?","Jeffrey Songer","Yes, this is Jeff. From a train length capacity, certainly, that\u2019s something we have opportunities on. I know Brian speaks a lot about the cross-border intermodal service or certainly opportunities there. Refined products where as it forms certainly more unit trains, which I know Brian is driving towards. There\u2019s opportunities there. So, yes, I think it\u2019s a fair assessment to say, we have opportunities in existing capacity just from a train length perspective.","I think the capacities at Sanchez, the other just physical infrastructure capacities certainly in place. We spent \u2013 we\u2019ve invested a lot in the L\u00e1zaro corridor to boost that traffic, which we feel good about right now. Certainly, the cross-border we talk a lot about and we feel very good on the U.S. side from a capacity standpoint.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","So I\u2019ll chime in here a little bit as well. A couple of questions came up on the call about intermodal. I really think our intermodal position and the strategy that we have and the relationships we\u2019ve developed puts us in terrific position to grow that business. We literally have a solution now with every container company, every railroad, every market that you can think of.","So we\u2019re focused on improving the consistency and reliability of service, density and volume, I believe will occur. The intermodal thesis for cross-border traffic is very solid, and we\u2019re just in a great position to take advantage of that.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time for questions. I\u2019ll now turn the floor back to Mr. Ottensmeyer for final remarks.","Patrick Ottensmeyer","Okay. So as you\u2019re thinking about your headlines, very strong quarter, amazing resilience, things like that, so come to mind. I mean we really feel that this was an extremely strong quarter, could have been better and dealing with the elements of nature in about the best possible way. So \u2013 and the growth outlook is really strong. There clearly are things out there that we\u2019re paying close attention to and trying to influence not just reading about them in the paper like NAFTA. And I think all we can say about NAFTA is that, all three parties are still at the table, negotiations will continue.","We are still hopeful and confident that NAFTA will be modernized. And even if things don\u2019t turn out the way we would hope, North American trade will continue and we will continue to play a role in those supply chains. So thank you for your time and attention, and we will tee this up again in about three months. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC. The Company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you and good morning, everyone and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I will start the presentation; obviously, everyone saw the press release that came out earlier.","Slide 4, we just list the folks who are on the call today. I'll mention -- hopefully this won't be all that noticeable, but I'm actually not with the rest of the team in Kansas City calling in remotely from New York, and I'm very proud to have been accepting an award last night for Kansas City Southern for -- from The Latino Corporate Directors Association for Exceptional Diversity, specifically the number of Latinos on our Board of Directors here in New York. So, hopefully get through any -- not have any technical issues here, but I will -- in the room with the rest of the team. Jose Zozaya is also on the phone from New York.","So, let's move on to Slide 5, the punch line slide for our third quarter earnings and I think we feel like we had a really good quarter. Revenue is up 7%, Mike Naatz will talk about the revenue side of the business and the outlook, which -- not to steal Mike's thunder, but we still feel that about 70% of our business units looked there to be positive for the remainder of the year, in spite of lots of [Technical Difficulty] about state of the economy in the U.S. and Mexico and around the world, we still feel that there's a reason to be hopeful and see signs of strength in a number of our business units.","[Technical Difficulty] not a real number when we exclude the impact of impairment charges that we took in the quarter that Mike Upchurch will get into in great detail in a few minutes, put us at 60.7%, 270 basis points from last year. And then when we back out and adjust for the impact of the -- the loss of the IEPS credit in Mexico, we could take that down by another 80 basis point. So, you can do the math in your head and what that results in as an operating ratio that put us in the low 60 for the third quarter.","Earnings per share of $1.81 adjusted again for the impact of impairment charges of $1.94, which is a 24% increase versus previous year. And that's feel really, really very good about the operating metrics [Technical Difficulty] into this in much greater detail. But \u2013 it\u2019s known and I\u2019ll admit that year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter from the third quarter of last year the term easy comp would certainly apply to our performance a year ago. But we are just making exceptional progress in terms of service, suggestion, operating metrics and as I'll say in a couple of minutes, there is -- we feel equally confident that there is net income in the quarters ahead.","So moving on to slide 6. We're not changing any of our guidance at this point. So, we're sticking with same guidance that we had in the third quarter. We are in the process of updating. We're going through as you've heard -- some of you've heard us talked about previously this white-boarding exercise with respect to our transportation service plan. We're making great progress. Sameh will talk more about that in a few minutes and we certainly expect that when we finish that in the next few weeks or couple of months that we will get better visibility and clarity on what that is going to produce in terms of operational savings and perhaps further improvement in operating ratio.","Obviously, with the operating ratio that we just put up for the quarter, we know we're going to get a lot of questions about the guidance that we're giving here on this page. And yes, we do expect that to change and improve. But we're not prepared to give more specific or different guidance at this point until we get through that process. We complete our plan for 2020 and look beyond So, we will be updating that most likely on the fourth quarter call in January, possible that we will give some earlier indications at a couple of conferences that we're scheduled to speak at. But at this moment, we're not changing the guidance for any of these metrics that our shown on slide 6.","So with that, I will pass the presentation to Jeff Songer.","Jeff Songer","Okay. Thank you, Pat and good morning. Starting with a review of the key operating metrics for the quarter on slide 8, the gross velocity of 13.9 miles per hour improved 32% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Dwell of 20.3 hours improved 23% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We're continuing to see strong year-over-year improvements in our key metrics. Acknowledging the impact of 2018 congestions on year-over-year comps, we continue to execute sequential improvement, illustrating our PSR efforts on maturing, while KPIs are reaching historically high levels.","Resiliency has been another key outcome of our PSR efforts. September's record breaking floods in the South East Texas had relatively little impact on -- to our operations. Our ability to quickly adjust trained plans and provide adequate recourses, crews and equipments during these events, allowed us to remain more fluid versus other weather events and our recovery was timely.","Boarder initiatives continue to support oversized growth of 12% for the quarter in cross-border volumes. To-date, we have operated over 2,500 trains with international crews greatly improving transit times. As another benchmark of strong performance, we have grown our cross-border business, by 34% in the past two years, as compared to Q3, 2017.","Turning to slide nine, we continue to see positive trends in all key metrics. Year-to-date velocity has improved 17%. And we should achieve full year velocity close to 14 miles per hour. Further illustrating sequential improvement, October month-to-date velocity is over 15 miles per hour, as velocity remains a primary focus of our PSR transition.","As you can see, all of the metrics are tracking at or above goal for the year. And our improvement is accelerating into the fourth quarter. Of note, fuel efficiency has improved 3% year-to-date and 5% for the quarter, again illustrating continual improvement. As you will see in Mike's material, fuel is the largest category of PSR savings with $22 million projected annualized benefit.","Reduced train starts, technology, proper assignment of locomotives. And better enforcement of locomotive utilization, all contribute to the improvement. For the quarter, we've realized $3 million in labor efficiencies through a combination of TSP adjustments, train start reductions, improved crew cost and reduced over time.","Looking forward, we are actively working with our Mexican union to progress those work rules, not consistent with the other North American railroads. Access crew size and greater operational flexibility are the main areas that we intend to modernize.","I will now turn the presentation over to Sameh to provide detail on other PSR efforts.","Sameh Fahmy","Thank you, Jeff. As Jeff covered, the velocity and dwell improvements and they are significant. And they have been the result of the execution side of PSR, with a few waves of TSP changes, design changes to the train to schedule.","And when I talk about the execution, I mean, discipline, compliance, accountability, pealing the onion every morning, on low velocity trains and delays and failures. So these things have allowed us to move forward, with that velocity and dwell. And we still have room to go.","We get on some days now in the U.S. 18 miles per hour. In Mexico, we get 15 miles per hour. So a combination of the two is now beginning to get us into higher range of velocity and as well as dwell. These improvements allowed us to take assets out. So, you have a lot of numbers here on this slide. We took out 14% of our locomotives. So now we have an active fleet of 903, when we started the PSR exercise it was 1,046.","We also took out a lot of cars. When you look at the active car count, we now run at about 58,000 cars. We used to be at 64,000 cars online, this time last year. And clearly, the last cars we had in the network, the better up you are, because that's a sign of fluidity and less congestion.","The car mile, Jeff touched on it. We are getting -- actually in Mexico we got an improvement of about 41% in our car miles per day. But we still have a lot of room to go, like we went from 70 miles per day to 100 miles per day.","But if you look at the statistics, even on KCS and U.S., but also on other class ones, we know that we can get to 150 and even higher than that. So we still have room to go there. When you take out a lot of assets and typically we take out the worst least reliable assets, you improve reliability. So failures, mechanical failures have reduced by 31%. And also, when you have less cars online, especially foreign cars that costs us daily, car hire, you end up with significant improvement in significant savings in the equipment cost. So, our equipment cost have gone down by 24% in Q3.","At the same time, also, crew costs have come down and Jeff has touched on that. They have come down 9% in this quarter compared to the same quarter last year. And that's in spite, by the way, of a rate increase in Mexico of 5%. So essentially a flat 14% improvement in productivity and things like that adding have come down by about 40%.","Fuel efficiency, Jeff touched on that, we have improved by 5%. When you have long trains and heavy trains, they are beautiful for fuel efficiency. And we are monitoring every morning, now the HPT, which is the horsepower per ton.","So, that you don't have too many locomotives for the tonnage. And we take every train that has a high HPT and challenge people and question, why do we have that many locomotives like five locomotives for 800 tons as an example, a few days ago, and same way as we check the velocity on every train. So that's a lot of what we have done so far.","Now looking forward, the biggest thing coming up is going to be the white-boarding exercise. Brian Hancock and his team, Olivia Daily and her team, they have done a superb job. I attended a full day meeting yesterday with a commercial team to make sure that the changes are going to be very well communicated to the customer, so that everything will be smooth when we implement this TSP change.","Now the genesis of our white-boarding is that, we went to San Luis Potos\u00ed on a field visit and it became clear to us that people were not compliant with the current TSP. And part of running a good railroad is that you comply with the plan. You don't ad-hoc. You don't run extra trains. You don't just do things by the seat of the pants, because you can end up improving what's happening in your yard, but you generate a lot of problems downstream.","Now what became clear to us is that the guys were doing that because of deficiencies in the current TSP. So we wanted to improve the TSP and no need for ad hocking, but put that in the plan itself. I'll give two examples of the new TSP that illustrated that what we are doing.","Right now, we have an area very important in Mexico, it's called the Saltillo. We have Encantada, Santa Maria, Rojas, Saltillo these are small yards that our always in 50 miles. And they service a lot of customers. So we have two intermodal trains that each one of them every day was set out three blocks to these areas.","And one manifest train that also drops three blocks. So you have a total of about nine blocks that come out of these trains every day. That switching, which is one of the things that are targeted by PSR, is you want to reduce touching cars and you need to reduce switch, and you want to reduce work events online.","Now these three trains are going to be replaced by one train that would combine the intermodal and manifest going to that area and will set out the blocks that will be combined, so if it's Santa Maria, intermodal and manifest, it will all go together. Rojas the same way.","So you drop three or four actually, because you have four locations, so four set out instead of today nine set outs of blocks. So, a significant improvement in reducing the work events, reducing train delays, improving velocity and reducing car dwell. That's an example.","Another small example is Escobedo, where we had another field visit in July and we are instead of building 16 blocks in that small yard, which is very tiny, we are going to build 10 blocks by moving some of the work to Mexico City where there is a very huge yard that is already building these blocks.","So these are two examples that show that we'll tax the car less, which is one principle of PSR and around fewer another trains, which is also an example of a target of PSR. We will also move gradually to big yards like Sanchez and Mexico City and try to do less work in these small yards where they have trouble handling big long trains on a lot of switching.","Two last points on my slide, we've put in place trip plan compliance measurements, so that we know a car from the time we get it until we deliver it, the exact time and seeing if that matches the expectations of the customers. So this is doing it through the eyes of the customer. So that our commercial people when they settle the customer, they are -- showing numbers that match what the customer wants to see.","And right now we have about 68% trip plan compliance. We have room to grow. We have room for improvement. We should be at 85% or 90%. And thankfully there is a survey that was done by the commercial team that shows that 77% of our customers are seeing a significant or moderate improvement in our transit time and our service.","Last point, we want to leverage capacity. We are freeing capacity without spending money, which is another principle of PSR. And we want to use that to grow our business. And the best example of that is grain, our cycles for grain. Our trips per months went from 1.20 to 1.42. That means instead of doing a trip, a round-trip, complete round-trip in 28 days, we do it in 21 days. Every day means $9 million increase annually in our revenue. And we have seen that in grain.","The revenue in Q3 and Mike Naatz is going to talk about that went up by 15%. So this is a big demonstration of what PSR is all about we generate, we improve service, we grow the business, we improve the revenue and actually right now we have about 800 cars surplus grain harpers that we hopefully will get more business with or if -- partially we get more business than the rest I guess, we'll have to dispose off.","So on that, I will pass it to Mike Naatz.","Mike Naatz","Thank you very much, Sameh. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin my comments on page 13. You'll see our year-over-year third quarter revenue was up 7% on a slight increase in volumes. This established records for both revenue and volume.","Similar to our prior quarters, our cross-border business was a key contributor to our performance with revenue increasing 17% and volume increasing about 12% year-over-year. During the quarter, our revenue per unit grew 7%, which was led by our growth in our Chemical & Petroleum and Ag\/Min business units. You may recall that these segments tend to have longer lengths of haul and higher revenue per unit. In addition, our fuel program also benefited our revenue per unit and our pricing renewals overall were consistent with our year-to-date performance.","As has been the case all year, the Chemical & Petroleum segment was our primary growth driver. Year-over-year third quarter revenue was up 21% on a 12% volume increase. The Mexico Energy Reform revenue grew 71% and a year-over-year volume increase of 59%. We did note, sequential decline in this traffic which was driven primarily by a reduction in LPG shipments, which tend to be influenced by the seasonal and commodity base pricing fluctuations.","Our Refined Products business was relatively flat sequentially, as we saw some delays and storage permitting in some overall demand softness. However, we remain very optimistic about the growth opportunity in the long-term and frankly our year-over-year refined product growth remained strong at 67%.","Driven largely by cross-border grain and food product business, our Ag\/Min segment had a great quarter, seeing a 15% increase in revenue and a 10% increase in volume. During the quarter, we continue to see improved cycle time, as Sameh mentioned. Simply put, we handle more volume with less equipment, which helped us realize improvements in both revenue and costs. Again, a great case study for PSR.","On the energy side of things, volumes and revenues were down due to decreases in frac sand and Canadian crude, which was partially offset by year-over-year growth in utility coal volumes. Our industrial consumer business unit revenue was up slightly on flat volumes. In this segment, our metals business was up year-over-year due to sourcing shifts. But these gains were partially offset by declines in our paper business, which continue to see pressure from alternative packaging solutions and available truck capacity.","With respect to the Intermodal business, revenue was up slightly on a 3% decrease in volumes. Our cross-border franchise volumes grew at 8%, while revenues remain flat due to shorter length of haul.","Domestic Intermodal volumes decrease on the yields of weak demand and ample trucking availability in the U.S. and our Lazaro revenue was up 10% on lower volumes, primarily due to the impact of our fuel program. Revenues and volumes were down in our Automotive segment, primarily, due to an unplanned plant shutdown and year-over-year shift productions and I'll talk more about that in a moment.","I guess with that, I'll move onto slide 14, where you\u2019ll see our revenue outlook for the fourth quarter 2019. As Pat mentioned, we are maintaining our revenue growth guidance of 5% to 7% and flat to slightly lower volumes. We do remain very positive on the Chemical and Petroleum business unit and the Mexico Energy Reform story.","Additionally, we expect to see favorable year-over-year growth in the Ag\/Min, and Industrial and Consumer segment, and this is primarily due to the continuing service improvements we're experiencing. However, we are monitoring recent trends in the paper market which continues to be soft and we are monitoring available truck capacity.","We are adjusting our Automotive segment to neutral for the fourth quarter with the positive impact of a new plan opening being largely offset by lower production forecast and plant shut downs.","And very specifically, we're currently being impacted by the GM strike, which ideally be assembly and transmission plan since a -- and if you may remember it allow us one of three GM plants we served at Mexico. Suffice to say that we are pleased to see that UAW and GM have reached a tentative labor agreement. So, we'll see how that plays out at the end of the month here.","And finally our expectations for Energy and Intermodal segments remain below last year for reasons already mentioned. I guess in summary, we'll continue to monitor the overall economic environment, and I'm happy to reiterate Pat\u2019s comment earlier that, our outlook is favorable for 70% of our revenues.","And with that, thank you for your attention. I'll turn things over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks Mike. I'm going to start my comments on slide 16. As Mike indicated, third quarter of 2019 revenues increased 7% over the prior year on a 7% increase in revenue per unit.","Fuel revenues increased $13 million or 19%, primarily due to a loss of the fuel excise tax credit that resulted in higher fuel prices in Mexico. The reported third quarter 2019 operating ratio was 62.3%, slightly worse than the 62% in the quarter a year ago.","However, operating ratio on an adjusted basis excluding the $12 million PSR restructuring charge was a record 60.7%, and 270 basis points improvement over the third quarter of 2018 adjusted operating ratio.","Included in the 60.7% operating ratio was a negative 80 basis point impact from the loss of the fuel excise tax credit. Adjusted expenses increased only 2%, evidence of strong cost control across all of our expense categories. Adjusted operating income increased 15% leading to strong incremental margins in the quarter of 78%.","KCS associates delivered a unique blend of topline growth, improving service, and strong cost control that led to outsized EPS growth in the quarter. And I'll speak more to expense details in the next two slides.","Third quarter of 2019 reported EPS of $1.81 was a 6% increase over the third quarter last year. However, on an adjusted basis, our EPS of $1.94, was a 24% increase over third quarter of 2018 with the majority of that increase coming from real operating income. A more detailed P&L and adjusted EPS details are contained in the Appendix on Slides 22 and 24.","And finally, our third quarter 2019 adjusted effective tax rate was 28.2%, and for the full year we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 27% to 28%. You can find more details on our taxes in the Appendix on Slide 25.","So, turning to Slide 17, let me provide a little bit of detail on our PSR update relative to the expense savings. We now expect to generate $58 million of expense savings in 2019 that is up from the $40 million estimate we've provided in July on our second quarter earnings call. And on an annualized basis, we now expect $75 million of operating expense benefits from our implementation of PSR.","In the compensation and benefits area, we now expect about $8 million of savings in 2019 and $14 million on an annualized basis, due to a variety of actions, including a train consolidation resulting in crew start reductions, reductions in debt heads, mechanical labor savings from the reduction of locomotives and equipment, and some G&A savings from restructuring efforts.","In the depreciation expense line, we expect $5 million of savings in 2019 and $8 million on an annualized basis, the direct result of disposing idled and excess assets. In fuel expense, we now expect $19 million of fuel expense savings for 2019 and $22 million on an annualized basis.","Our year-to-date fuel efficiency has improved from 1.34 to 1.30 gallons per gross ton mile, thousand gross ton miles, but currently stands at 1.26. And we've seen improvements from various actions we have taken, including train consolidation and technology investments and the utilization of tools, such as Trip Optimizer and Smart HPT.","Equipment savings are expected to be $13 million in 2019 and $19 million on an annualized basis. Overall, we've seen a 15% year-to-date improvement in cycle times, meaning we're getting equipment off of our network much faster and paying less car hire. Overall, since the beginning of 2019, we have reduced cars online by 17% and more importantly, we have reduced the cars we pay car hire, on namely foreign and TTX cars, by 22% over the same period.","And finally, in purchase services and materials and other, expense savings are now expected to be $13 million in 2019, which includes a one-time $5 million contract settlement from a vendor. On an annualized basis, we expect an approximate $12 million in savings in these expenses, mainly from reduced repair incidence from disposing of equipment and contract restructuring.","Turning to slide 18. Adjusted operating expenses increased 2%; primary drivers of our expense increase were incentive compensation increase of $10 million and the $9 million third quarter year-over-year loss of the fuel excise tax credit. Fuel consumption was up $5 million, but efficiency gains offset the entire consumption increase.","I'll discuss comp and benefits and fuel expense more on the next slide, but let me comment on a few other expense items. First, we experienced higher year-over-year derailment in casualty expense of $4 million, largely due to one incident late in the quarter. Offsetting that derailment expense was a one-time credit from a vendor, resulting from poor performance.","Second, equipment expense declined 24%, and as I mentioned before, is the result of fewer cars online, particularly foreign and TTX card for which we pay car hire. In the third quarter, KCSM experienced a 25% improvement in cycle times.","Turning to slide 19. Comp and benefit expense increased largely due to higher incentive comp expense in the quarter. In 2018, we were recruited well below target in the third quarter, while in 2019, we are well above target. We recognized $6 million of incentive expense in the quarter to reflect the increased payout.","Wage inflation of $4 million was offset by a $3 million reduction in comp and benefits expense from lower headcount and fewer hours work. Headcount, excluding the in-sourcing of 91 FTE was down 1% and we continue to believe we will manage 2019 at reduced headcount levels from 2018.","And as a note, we're using average FTE for the quarter in the bar charts, but at September 30, 2019, we were down 2% year-over-year. Comp and benefit savings at this stage of our PSR implementation have resulted from train consolidation that has reduced crew starts, reduced hours worked, including overtime and mechanical reductions due to fewer locomotives and freight cars and finally in some G&A areas.","As Sameh talked about our white-boarding efforts and as we conclude those, we would expect to see some further reductions going forward. However, we will manage certain growth corridors, such as our cross-border network with more FTE.","And location such as Laredo, Texas and Sanchez, to support the strong double-digit volume and revenue growth, we have been experiencing for the past year. Simply put, we will continue to grow human resources in growth parts of our network, while rightsizing FTE, where traffic volumes do not support the level of human resources.","It's also important to remember that the formal process in Mexico is not as flexible as it is in the U.S. And unless we can agree to more flexible work rules with the union, we will continue to have a scenario where FTE reductions may not be as great.","However, our work hours will continue to decline, resulting in reduced compensation expense, as approximately 75% of pay is variable. And I might remind our analysts and investors that back in 2009, when we saw a 25% reduction in revenue and a 19% reduction in volume in Mexico, we've scaled comp and benefits expense extremely well showing a decline of 27%.","With respect to fuel expense, fuel expense declined 3%, as a result of efficiency improvements from our PSR implementation. We carried 6% more GTMs in the quarter, compared to a year ago, with essentially the same amount of fuel being burned. Lower prices in the U.S. also have help reduce fuel expense, but we did experience slightly higher fuel prices in Mexico.","And finally on slide 20, we have included our capital allocation priorities. We continue to believe investing in our network, particularly our cross-border network, to support the high-growth rates we are seeing, is the right priority. We expect capital expenditures of less than $600 million for the full year 2019. And on a longer-term basis, we would expect CapEx to revenue ratios at around 18%.","During the quarter, we have repurchased 816,000 shares of our stock, at an average price of $1.22. Year-to-date cash flow has increased 76%, for the nine months ending September 30, 2019. Despite paying cash for 50 new locomotives that we acquired in the first half of the year. Accordingly, we will continue to work in ways to return excess cash to investors through both dividends and stock buybacks.","And since we are on pace to complete the current $800 million stock buyback program by the end of this year, we are actively working with our board to develop a new capital allocation policy, that we intend to communicate to investors by the end of the year.","And now, I'll turn the call back to Pat.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you, Mike. I just want to circle back on \u2013 quickly on a couple of things before we get into the Q&A. Again, we feel terrific about the performance of the quarter. Top line growth, significant progress and sustainable PSR-related cost savings. I think there is certainly more to come. We have a pretty positive outlook, certainly for the rest of the year. And please don't ask too many questions about 2020 guidance, we're going to be pretty stubborn in our position of not talking about 2020 on this call. There'll be more to come over the course of the next few months and certainly on the fourth quarter call about our outlook for the coming year -- or for next year and beyond. But very pleased with the progress we're making on improving our service most importantly.","As Sameh talked about the -- we are seeing this -- everyone is familiar with my favorite phrase, service begets growth, but we're seeing that playing out as we improve our service, as we are able to relieve congestion in our yards and on our network. We're putting assets; they're freed-up to use to handle more business. We're confident that some of these oversized growth opportunities that we've been talking about for the last several quarters are real. And if we can do our part to provide the service that is required to handle that business, it's actually materializing.","Go back to a comment that Mike talked about. Look at the improvement in operating income that we had versus last year, 15% record operating income and if you sort of take that down through the income statement, about 70% of our EPS gain year-over-year for the quarter was due to actual improvement in operating income. So, I think that's a significant fact to keep in mind, if you -- as you look at our performance.","So, -- and again, we feel like that there is runway ahead of us, both on the cost and service improvement side and certainly on the revenue opportunity. So, with that, I will conclude our comments and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Pat, I just wanted to kind of ask question on Slide 6 you had mentioned earlier in the call that the guidance will change and improve. And I guess, I just want to make sure, I understood what you are kind of commenting there, I'm guessing it sort of the OR, EPS, and CapEx targets that our beyond 2019? But, just any thoughts you can give on that will be helpful?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yeah. I think, it'll be across the Board obviously as we finish our plan I think the key for us and why we're really going to we stubborn about talking about 2020 is this white-boarding exercise that Sameh and Jeff talked about; Brian, his team -- we're making great progress on that, but we aren't at point where we really feel like we know what that's going to result in terms of service improvements, cost profile, et cetera. So, -- but let us finish that.","So, certainly, the one number on Slide 6 that I'm sure everyone looks at with the quarter that we just produced and says that doesn't seem real is operating ratio. But we certainly expect to update that and I expect it to be certainly better than the guidance that we've given up to this point, but we'll certainly freshen the guidance on everything.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate it. And then just a follow-up on the Mexican work rules and the progress there, can you give us a little bit of sense of what the timing might look like as you go through that process? And maybe what a potential outcome might look like as well?","Jeff Songer","This is Jeff. I'll take that one. So we continue to have discussions with the Mexican Union regarding just modernization rules more than anything. I've talked numerous times about crew size in Mexico, significant amount of three and four personal crews. We know where we're heading in the U.S. and then for the rest of the North American trade systems. So there's ample room for a crew size. But probably an equally and maybe even more important are just our flexibility. The way the union sections are structured, we have a lot of division within the network.","You have a lot of overlap and a lot of restrictions. For example, coming into one of our yards, you have three sections that integrate into that same yard and when the train pulls in, we have to arbitrarily stop a train, swap out a crew and maybe do that multiple times by the time that train could run through the terminal. So those types of work rule improvements as significant as maybe some of the headcount initiatives.","We're simply pulling off a fourth brakeman and third brakeman who literally don't have a lot to do if anything to do on these trains; it's something we're working on. I would underscore what Mike said about the cost -- relatively if these road crews aren't working there's relatively little cost associated with it. So that's why I wanted to highlight the cost benefit of the labor without necessarily seeing all the headcount reductions at this point.","Timing wise, I think it will be -- we're continuing to discuss. There was meeting in Mexico City last week. We\u2019re continuing to facilitate this. I hope we have some breakthrough here before the end of the year. But it's something that we're still working very hard on.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Justin Long","Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. So as we think about the new run rate for PSR savings, can you talk about how dependent these savings are -- on how the top-line trends? I think it's pretty clear, we've seen some weakness in the broader freight market in the economy. So do you think these savings or maybe something higher or -- are still achievable if the demand backdrop just stays around where it is today?","Mike Naatz","Yeah. This is Mike. I certainly think so Justin. And we were really challenging ourselves here with access equipment as Sameh said. Our goal here is if we can deploy that access idle equipment in the marketplace and sell more product like we did in the third quarter with grain. We absolutely want to keep that equipment because the margin that you generate on that is certainly a lot better, but if we see a macro downturn that's more significant than where we're at today. We may have to adjust if the demand for those assets isn't out in the marketplace. ","Justin Long","Okay. And secondly, I wanted to ask about revenue per carload. It seems like you're continuing to benefit from positive mix with Chemical & Petroleum and the AG segment performing really well on the top line. Can you just talk about the sustainability of this positive mix going forward? And, should we also be thinking about the OR and incremental margin this quarter being impacted fairly significantly from that mix tailwind?","Mike Upchurch","Hi, good morning. This is Mike. I'll take a crack at that. So, yes we do anticipate that revenue per unit is going to continue to be healthy like you're seeing today. And that is because as you said the mix changes.","The Chemical & Petroleum units, definitely brings in more revenue per unit. And as long as that continues to grow disproportionately to some of the other business units like intermodal, that revenue per unit is going to continue to improve.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","Yeah. Good morning and Jeff congratulations on the strong results. It seems like you've got a lot of momentum. Wonder if -- I know Pat, you said, you're going to be pretty careful about 2020 commentary. Perhaps if I pose it little bit more narrowly, how are you thinking about the white-boarding process, and I guess what the outcome might be? Are you looking at -- should we expect a pretty significant reduction in train starts from that? If so, is it 10% reduction in train starts? What's kind of -- I don't know if they\u2019re broader framework for our expectations on the white-boarding? And also if you are on track, on timing to implement it at the end of the fourth quarter?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Hey Tom, see, I think I used the word stubborn, not careful when I talked about 2020 guidance. I'd like to have Sameh and Brian, since a lot of the work in the white-boarding is taking place with his group.","But to talk about, maybe some of the things we're focusing on the activities and the expected outcomes in terms of activities. And not financial results of the white-boarding results.","Sameh Fahmy","Yeah. Like I said, this is Sameh. Like I said earlier, we are very focused on the two things that are the pillars of PSR. One is, reduce switching, which is -- lot of people call it how many times you touch a car.","And the second one is, reducing trains with train consolidation. And that's where you'll reduce crew starts. The example I gave was really very illustrative of that. I said that, instead of three trains, you essentially go down to two.","One is going to do all the work, in these places around all deals [ph], the other one will go through without stopping. So you reduce the switching, you reduce delays, by the way these trains when they do that work, setting out locks, they block the mainline.","So, when you go down from line of these operations every day to four, you reduce obviously delays significantly. And that will help with the velocity of the network. What we need to understand is that on the Mexico network, yards are where we spent a lot of time; yard is where the big potential and the big opportunity is.","And the less work you do in these yards and the faster you can get trains through that yard, the faster the fluidity of the whole network is going to be. So, as an example and Jeff touched on that, if you have a train that doesn't do any work in that yard, don't make it go through that yard and that's part of the new white-boarding exercise.","Jeff was talking about this in particular, the train goes through the yard because of -- some of these labor rules and we hope to get that around the yard and not having to do -- not having to slowdown everything and slowing -- getting the train itself to be slowed down by the switching happening in the yard.","One of the biggest delays we have in the network is train held out of terminals, because they cannot get in because there is no space to get in. So these things -- the team has been very, very focused on. Like I said, I spend a day with them yesterday and the commercial people. A few days ago, I've spent a lot of time with Olivia, who's leading this effort under Brian Hancock's leadership, who is sitting right next to me here. And they are really doing a fantastic job.","And at the end of the day, we are going to reduce the number of blocks that we create. We'll do them more outsourced. We'll do them in the big yards like Sanchez, where there is a lot of room and it will be more efficient.","One thing that is contradictory between train consolidation and switching. When you have long trains, at the end of the day they go in yards. The yards have short tracks that are not necessarily -- they were not built for that kind of train. So, that sequence of doing these things and doing them in a smart way is very important, and that's what the team is focused on.","The implementation will start November 5, which was part of your question. That's going to be Phase 1. That is going to be three phases. The third phase will start towards the end of this quarter in December. So, we will hopefully complete this exercise around -- I would say, January, February at the latest. I don't know, Brian, if you want to add.","Brian Hancock","The only thing Tom that I would throw in as well is, I think one of the differences in our work that we're doing and Olivia\u2019s team is doing is, we're continuing to try to build the network that can hold more freight. So this white-boarding exercise is not only taking out these work events. This waste of time that Jeff talked about in the yard, but we\u2019re trying to make sure that these trains have capacity to be able to fill them with this additional freight, whether it is manifest freight, Intermodal freight, but there -- we continue to believe we can grow the network.","And so, it's a little bit different white-boarding exercise because we really feel good about not only the cost side, but the revenue upside. So, I think Sameh and Jeff hit the points very well. But very proud of the work that the team is doing and looking forward to what we see here in the backside of the fourth quarter and in the first quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Amit Mehrotra","Thank you, operator. Hi, everyone. Congrats again. So just cost -- I guess costs related to purchase services and equipment have never been lower relative to the size of the enterprise or the revenue base. So it does seem to be some further opportunity I guess in materials and other expenses.","So just related to the white-boarding exercise, if you could just help us think about how those cost can evolve maybe the right way to think about it or if you can express it in absolute dollar basis, because those buckets together are higher than total compensation and benefits on the annual basis. So if you could just -- do you think you can hold those costs flat to down as revenues continue to grow over the next few quarters? I think that would just be helpful on an absolute dollar basis, that hopefully\u2026.","Mike Upchurch","Amit, this is Mike. Yeah, I think we can continue to see this go down over the medium-term. I think going into fourth quarter, it may look a bit more like flattish because we included in other as casualty expense, and we had not so great quarter in the third quarter on casualties. But generally, the longer-term trend would be down on that. Fourth quarter, roughly flat maybe from third quarter, which implies some declines in the casualty expense.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just maybe pivoting a little bit to the capital deployment, I guess, disclosure in the slide in terms of the year-end, getting some more update on that. Well, certainly are we going to wait till year end, but I guess, Mike, if you could just help us think about the philosophy of that company with respect to balancing the risk as well as the return to shareholders on capital deployment.","Is it a debt-based metric? I know you talked about, kind of, leverage being a 2.2 times. Do you think -- if you could just talk about the philosophy? And then, do you think your leverage profile used to be any different than the larger class ones and just how you think about that on a relative basis?","Mike Upchurch","Yes. No. Good question. I mean, we're going to have some more concrete answers for you before the end of the year. As I mentioned, we're working with our board right now and ultimately that's a board decision. But, specific to your leverage question, we feel quite comfortable with where we're at with leverage.","And if we can continue to manage this at a low two range, which is our desire that would imply with earnings growth that there's some flexibility on the balance sheet that could be put to use. But we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves with the specific actions we may or may not take. So that would be my sense.","Only other comment I would make is, our credit metrics look as good as anybody's in the industry. But unfortunately, the rating agencies seem to think that smaller is not as good as being larger, but I have those debates with them probably twice a year. And I think our numbers speaks for themselves.","Operator","The next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good morning. I just wonder if you could comment on what you're seeing in the pricing environment, maybe first, just sort of broadly speaking. And then, whether you're starting to see incremental yield benefit resulting from the improved service levels and reliability?","Mike Upchurch","This is Mike. And in general, we feel good about our pricing environment, and going forward, we expect that we're going to perform at the levels that you've seen this year. And certainly, it makes it easier to do so when we're improving our service product. It gives us a little more confidence when we're going in there and we're having those discussions with our customer.","Allison Landry","Okay. And then, I also wanted to ask about the -- there was a recent change, I believe, at the border where the CBP from both the U.S. and Mexico are now sort of sitting in the same building and doing inspections with the common viewer.","Is this something, we should think about or view as meaningful? And how much of an impact perhaps longer-term do you think that this could have in terms of speeding up the time it takes for our trains to cross a bridge or just sort of overall bridge capacity in the future? Thank you.","Brian Hancock","Hi, Allison. This is Brian. I'll take that one. Actually, Jeff and I were at the bridge yesterday. We had an outstanding trip and we had not only the CBP from the U.S., but SAT from Mexico. We went through our entire strategy with them and they were in complete agreement.","And so, what I would say right now at the border, as you have four organizations ourselves in the UP, as well as our two border crossing regulatory bodies focused on really making that border seamless as we possibly can, making sure security is high.","But I would tell you, it's going to have an impact. We're trying to create -- like Sameh said before, we're trying to create capacity without needing to spend capital dollars. One way to do that is to take those pinch points like the bridge and make them more fluid, use technology to make that happen and absolutely, that's -- it's an enormous focus for us and we just spent two days down there making sure that everybody continues to be aligned. So, yes, you'll see more.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Pat you talked about on the guidance slide that the OR guidance, sort of, stands out now. I'm wondering with the white-boarding going on, if you think the supplies take CapEx as well?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yes. No doubt about that. I mean, we obviously took our guidance down on CapEx last quarter. Feel very confident that well come in well below -- below the $600 million that we talked about. We didn't take of our guidance down again. But I think we're very confident that we'll come in below that $600 million level.","And we're seeing areas, Sameh talked a little bit about some of the yard work that we're doing in Mexico, there maybe some CapEx required as we, sort of, rethink how we use the yards and how we use the network in Mexico, deemphasizing some of the smaller, more congested yards should require some capital in the larger kind of load centers that we're going to be focusing on. But we don't really have a real clear idea on what that might involve, probably not substantial enough to move the needle. So, yes, as we continue to operate more efficiently, do more for -- with less equipment, it's obviously going to have an impact on our CapEx going forward.","Scott Group","Okay, good to hear. And then just wanted to follow-up on the mix question again on Ag and Chems. So, I mean your Ag is growing -- I don't think anybody else's is. Do you think that piece on Ag is sustainable?","And then on the Chemical side, I know you don't want to get too much into 2020, but like -- are the pieces there to sustain double-digit volume growth in that business segment?","Mike Naatz","This is Mike. And yes, we do continue to see -- do expect to see continued strong growth on cross-border, whether that's coming from the Chemical & Petroleum business or the Ag\/Min or frankly other segments. Year-over-year comps may make it a little more challenging, but we feel very good about the cross-border franchise.","Operator","The next question comes from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Pat or Mike, can you just give us an update on the intermodal competitive situation post the fuel excise credit, is that stabilizing? And to what extent are you able to recover some of that pricing through field clusters?","Mike Upchurch","Well, as you know the fuel excise tax credit was taken away from all railroads at the end of April and has not been reinstituted. We continue to have ongoing conversations with leadership -- government leadership in Mexico to try to get that reinstated because it is somewhat of a competitive disadvantage against the trucking that we compete with predominantly in the intermodal business.","I don't think we can handicap that. I'm probably not as optimistic that we're going to get that reinstated, but there is a possibility that generally happens towards the end of the year. But one other option the government has would be to level of playing field and no longer provide the credit to trucking industry. So that would be a favorable outcome as well and eliminate that disadvantage that we have.","With respect to putting those costs into our fuel program in Mexico, we started out in May and it's had the intended consequences that we wanted to offsetting the higher fuel prices that we were presented with at the end of April.","Ravi Shanker","Got it. And if I can follow-up to that, would you want the excise credit to come back? Does having a fuel surcharge mechanism actually benefit you in that? There are certain times when you can actually be on the right side of the equation and maybe even make some money in terms of the fuel pass through mechanism?","Mike Upchurch","We do not make money on the fuel program. Trust me, we would prefer to have that credit back because we have a structural difference here with higher fuel costs in Mexico and when you gross that up in the fuel program, that's a 100% OR business. And as I indicated earlier, it had an 80 basis point negative impact to our operating ratio in the third quarter. So getting that credit back would certainly help us from that standpoint.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Seidl of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, operator. Hey, everyone. Appreciate the time. Just looking at some of the trade issues that's ongoing, both with China and USMCA. With China, I think you mentioned before that you guys might benefit with some trade moving towards Mexico. One, have you seen that? And two, do you think that's permanent? And on the USMCA, do you think once it is signed, you could see a boost in your business? And then I'll have a follow-up on your cross-border business.","Sameh Fahmy","Jason I think, we -- I can't give you a list of examples of companies who have made decisions and actually made investments moving business operations to Mexico as a result of the fallout with China. I was at a conference a couple of weeks ago in Mexico City that Graciela M\u00e1rquez, who is the Finance Minister in Mexico, was speaking. And she mentioned that they are seeing more activity of companies, who are interested in relocating operations from Asia. So, we\u2019re trying to engage with the Mexican government to help because logistic is consideration and how those companies can act to the rest of North America is certainly consideration for those decisions.","So, we believe that that is likely to happen. But I can't give you a list of specific companies that we're actually seeing do that. And I think largely because there are still a cloud of uncertainty about USMCA.","On the USMCA side, everything we hear in discussions, private, public, media, put it all together, everything that we hear is that speaker Pelosi is ready to bring it to the floor and believes that this is a good thing for America. So she is -- if you look at some of the comments that she has made publicly, she is kind of denying the fact that Democrats in Congress are trying to deny a victory for President Trump that this is a victory for the American people and it should be approved. It hasn't actually made it into the floor of the house yet. But everything we hear is that, it should be -- move forward. And we\u2019re certainly hopeful and doing everything we can to nudge it in that positive direction to try to get it done by the end of the year. Brian mentioned event that they were at the border yesterday and earlier this week, that was actually a group that was hosted by us and the Commerce Department, focused on trade facilitation, border crossing issues.","And so I think we have the full support and cooperation of everyone in Washington, in the White House, the West Wing, the Commerce Department seem to be pushing forward with approval in fairly -- quick approval on USMCA.","Jason Seidl","Now, that\u2019s some great color. And let's hope Washington gets up its buck still with some rail work. In terms of cross-border, obviously, I saw some nice growth in the quarter. There's a lot of opportunity at least I believe going forward to gain market share. What's the key going forward to have market share rate? Is it more your improved service reliability? Is it that along with increased visibility for the shippers? And where are you guys with sort of increases ability from origin to destination?","Mike Naatz","This is Mike. And I'll take that one. I think you hit the nail on the head. Key to our competitiveness on the cross-border side being able to move market share from other modes of transportation is going to be service related.","As we get in a more competitive product, as we have a more consistent reliable product, we believe we're much more efficient way, much more secure way to move freight across the border and that will help us.","To the extent that we can provide greater supply chain visibility for our shipments that is something that Brian and the IT team are working on. We're currently embarking on a rewrite of the Mi, KCS system, which should improve many capabilities for our customers, including visibility.","Pat Ottensmeyer","I think one thing I would add to this is if you go back to our script and think about our comments from a year ago, certainly third and fourth quarter of last year, we said things like we weren't happy with our own performance. We weren't satisfying our customer expectation. We believed that there was more business that we could handle than we were able to handle because of service issues.","Look at our service metrics. I mean, they have improved substantially from this time last year and they're sustainable. We've always felt very confident that if we did our part in terms of consistency, reliability of service and resiliency of our network that these oversized growth opportunities were real and that they were materialized.","So kind of the -- go back to my favorite quote, service begets growth, we're seeing it happen and if we sustain and improve and continue to improve the consistency and reliability, we feel very confident that these growth opportunities are real and we'll see it in volume and revenue growth going forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good morning, everyone. And thanks for taking my question here. I guess Mike, can you talk about, actually the balance sheet here, because you guys have at least given us outlook on capital to be about 18% of revenue looking forward. So at this margin levels, you guys are actually generating pretty decent cash flow. What's the priorities here below low CapEx, I guess?","Mike Upchurch","Return to shareholders and as I indicated earlier, we'll provide that guidance before the end of the year as we're currently working with our Board on a new capital allocation policy.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. But I think it looks like, you did say your target leverage ratio is about 2.2, is that the right way to think about it? Or with better conversion lower tax rate should we think that could be higher in the future?","Mike Upchurch","Yeah, I think, we're still low twos, but it could go up a little bit from where we're at.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter","Hey. Great update on PSR and the cost gains for the quarter. So thanks for that. Jeff, just a quick one, you noted quickly \u2013 you quickly adjusted to the weather. Is that because of new plan or were you saying the weather was not new to your network? And then I guess and the same thing with the Mexican Energy Reform deceleration is that because of the lag to tank to truck permission or is it seasonal? Or are you saying it's now becoming more cyclical?","Jeff Songer","I'll take the first part of that. So the weather now this \u2013 there is actually more rain in certain parts than we saw in Harvey impacting basically Houston and trackage, right? So there were multiple days of outages on our \u2013 on trackage right segments through Houston, but again as I said, so it certainly was not near as impact was something like Harvey, but there was outage time that because of how we've kind of regenerated the service plan down there.","Mike indicated earlier, we've actually added some resources in some quarters to be able to shelf-through these things a little better now than we probably have in the past. So I think it's a combination of TSP design, resource allocation and just execution.","Mike Upchurch","I'll take the portion of your question regarding the movements of refined products or Energy Reform. Again, our growth has been very strong there on a year-over-year basis. While we did see a little bit of sequential weakness LPGs was really the driver of that, as I mentioned in my comments that tend to be influenced by seasonal and pricing fluctuations.","The refined products demand softness is probably driving a little bit of what's going on in Mexico coupled with the storage permitting and retail permitting delays. As those delays \u2013 and we expect that we'll be moving more product into Mexico, particularly as it relates to towing up all the storage tanks that are going to be built over the next couple of years, and including our TCM facility, which we have approval to move products now in and out of those tanks, which is a plus.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. Mike, maybe if you can size the opportunity for when those permits come down the pipe in terms of additional payrolls, I think that was in your slide deck maybe last year. So, maybe if you can give us an update on some of those specific facilities as they stand out there's anything changed other than just waiting for the permitting?","Mike Upchurch","I'm flipping through my information here. I believe that, there is eight facilities that are opening up next year that will include storage. I don't have the barrel information in front of me. But we believe there's opening\u2019s in the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter of those eight facilities. We have direct access to five of those facilities and then we have secondary access into the remaining three.","So, again we're very, very optimistic about Mexico Energy Reform and our ability to drive revenue in that category.","Brian Ossenbeck","All right. Thanks Mike. Pat, may be one for you as we talked about crew size, I missed call for Mexico, but obviously, the crew size in the U.S. is going to be topic for discussion in the next couple of years.","Can you just give us some thoughts on how you see that rolling out? And to the extent that a positive change control have to play a big impact, a big factor in that rather, how is that working on -- excuse me, on your system, especially from an interoperability standpoint given the high-low of interchange you have at the other class 1s? So, appreciate some thoughts on crew size and impact of PTC.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Just basic comment on crew size, we're in the process, the collective bargaining process with the rest of the railroads. You probably saw an announcement a couple of weeks ago that involve the railroads actually filing a suit. That's really just part of the normal choreography to get the process started, so it was nothing unusual. It was really just sort of step that was required to kind of engage in the process for new collective bargaining agreement -- industry-wide agreement hopefully in the next few months.","As far as your other part of the question, I'll defer that one to Jeff.","Jeff Songer","So, I guess as far as PTC implementation, interoperability is moving along to schedule. I don't think we look at ourselves any different from the other railroads on any less or greater impact will PTC interoperability, something Brian and the team are working very hard against.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Pat Ottensmeyer for any closing remarks.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you all very much for your time and attention. I know there are a lot of KCS associates and colleagues on the call here and I just want to make a comment that we\u2019re very pleased and very proud with the performance that we've posted here in the quarter and the outlook and appreciate everyone's -- many members of the PSR, very cross functional deep into the organization effort here and appreciate all of your hard work and performance here.","So, for the analysts and investors on the call, I know you have found my suggestions about headlines very helpful in the past. A few phrases come to mind when we look at the quarter. We think this is really a quality quarter, a quality beat if you want to put it in those terms, with our performance driven by topline growth and sustainable PSR-related performance improvements and cost savings.","And perhaps most importantly, we believe that there is more to come. We're not done yet certainly with our transformation and we'll have more to say about that over the coming months and certainly on the fourth quarter call in January.","So, with that, I will conclude the call. Thank you very much for your attention.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"12210":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 19, 2013  8:45 AM ET","Executives","David L.

Welcome to the Kansas City Southern First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, filed with the SEC.

All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David L. Starling","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Kansas City Southern's first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me this morning on the call is Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, Dave Ebbrecht; Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Pat Ottensmeyer; and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Upchurch. And also Jos\u00e9 Zozaya, our President and Executive Representative from Mexico, is also on the call.","As always, we have quite a bit to cover this morning, so in the interest of time, I'll get right to it. We usually don't lead off our overview section with a refinancing bullet, but I think this time it's worthy of an exception. Attaining investing grade status has been one of the primary corporate goals of KCS for a number of years, certainly from the point we had to refinance some debt in December 2008 at 13%. With S&P's upgrade of KCS in March, KCS officially met the threshold to be classified as an investment-grade company. With Moody's upgrade this past Wednesday, KCSM is now rated investment grade by the 3 primary agencies, S&P, Moody's and Fitch. To come so far in a little over 5 years is an accomplishment, which we are quite proud of at KCS.","And being a company which never rests on its laurels, we are quickly investment-grade status to work, as we announced last week, to access the debt market with the intention of further reducing interest expense while also lengthening the maturity of our debt portfolio. Mike Upchurch will have more to say about that in his section.","KCS again enjoyed excellent growth in some of the most dynamic business sections like crude oil, which saw revenue growth by 369%; cross-border intermodal, which grew by 71%; and automotive revenues, which climbed 31%. Unfortunately, the fantastic growth we experienced in those areas was partially offset by the impact of last year's historic drought on our grain business, which was down 38%. The effects of the drought somewhat masked what was in fact a good quarter for most of the rest of our business segments. If you take grain out of the equation, our reported consolidated volumes were up 4% and revenues were up 6%.","Three things stand out related to our first quarter grain story. First, the problem is totally the result of the drought. Our customer base is solid, the demand is greater than ever and our service is excellent. While the demand is there, it's the product that is in short supply, and that's the reason for the fall-off in volumes.","Second, the good news is the U.S. has a more normal-sized harvest this year. KCS is in a position to have a very strong fourth quarter, with potentially a record number of shuttle trains moving between the U.S. and Mexico.","The third key point, despite the low volumes, is one of our principal commodities. KCS improved its operating ratio compared to a year ago. This could not have happened without the contribution of strong operations and excellent resource planning and deployment.","Going to our first quarter results for the quarter. Consolidated volumes were up 2%, and revenues were up 1%. I already discussed the impact of the drought on our first quarter.","Another factor which affected our first quarter was this year's early Easter and last year being a leap year. This impacted both our carloads and revenues by over 1%.","Now this is inconsequential in terms of full year outlook, but the reality is the last couple of weeks of the quarter provided us with some tough comps. Of course, this also means that the early April comps are easier and that's given us a nice start to the second quarter.","The KCS operating ratio improvement from 71.2% in the first quarter of 2012 to 70.5% in 2013. One other challenges we faced in maintaining a good operating ratio in the first quarter was that unlike the coal business, where we don't own the coal cars, the utilities do, we do own or lease the grain cars. That means we had considerably more idle assets than we normally do. In addition, because we're forecasting strong grain movements later in the year, we could not do any significant rationalization accrues. So all things considered, we are satisfied with our OR in the first quarter.","Finally, our reported diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.94 compared to $0.68 a year ago. As you remember, starting in the fourth quarter last year, we started to provide an adjusted diluted earnings per share number, which excludes the impact for foreign exchange below the line. For the first quarter of 2013, our adjusted diluted EPS was $0.89, which compared to $0.80 adjusted diluted EPS for the first quarter of 2012.","Go to the next slide, update for first quarter 2013. During our fourth quarter call, Pat and I emphasized that because of the poor corn harvest, the first half of 2013 would likely not be as strong as the second half. Well, I guess you can say we didn't disappoint, at least in so far as projecting early 2013. Our grain numbers ended up being somewhat worse than we anticipated, which, depending on this year's harvest, could marginally impact our final year's percentage revenue numbers.","Anyway, first quarter carloads were up 2%. We're still confident that barring another horrible drought, we'll end the year in the mid single-digit range in terms of volume. In other words, on guidance. First quarter revenue grew by 1%. Clearly, we have some ground to make up to hit our high single-digit revenue growth number for the year. Can we do it? Yes. But given there's still nearly 5 months before the new crop is harvested, we will continue to experience some pretty anemic grain volumes for a while. The initial word we're hearing is this year's crop should be better. In fact, it could be a record. But last year, at this time, we were hearing of a possible record harvest as well. And we all know how that turned out. So right now, it would be prudent to project KCS' full year revenue percentage increase in the mid-single-digit range, with the hopes that we might do some better.","Our core pricing is right where we said it would be for the year, in the mid-single-digit range. We feel good about staying in that range. Our 70.5% first quarter operating ratio looks good relative to our guidance. That we'll improve over last year's 69.9% adjusted OR number. And last but not least, our capital budget will probably take us somewhat higher than the 21% we guided to, probably more in the 24% range, primarily due to our decision to purchase more equipment and our projected carload growth in certain commodities. Mike Upchurch will have a bit more to say about our capital budget later.","I'll return at the end of the presentation with a couple of final thoughts. But right now, I'm turn it over to Dave Ebbrecht.","David R. Ebbrecht","Okay, thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. This chart clearly represents our consistent ability to control cost and scale expenses. Even when facing such a significant decline in our grain business, it really bodes well for our operating team on both sides of the border to react so quickly to market fluctuations. We also had a very challenging comp to overcome as Holy Week and Easter fell in the first quarter instead of the second. On a daily basis, we pay very close attention to leading indicators and inbound volumes to quickly and efficiently adjust our operating plan to ensure we contain our operating cost. We remain very confident that we will continue this trend and remain very flat for the foreseeable future as we accommodate the increased volumes projected for the remainder of the year.","On Slide 10, you can see the continued positive results for our headcount controls. We will see occasional dips in this efficiency metric due to seasonal variations in carloads shipped from quarter-to-quarter, but the overall trend will continue to remain very positive. We also made the decision to not cut back forces in areas where we know the grain volumes will return in order to avoid future hiring and training costs. The most recent dip in efficiency is part due to in-sourcing of contracted services in Mexico upon expiration of the service term. All this -- although this in-sourcing shows a slight inefficiency on the chart, it saves us $5 million a year in contracted expense. We will also continue to evaluate other contracted services and may increase our headcount further by taking some more work in-house, where it clearly makes sense financially.","On Slide 11, you can see that all of our operating metrics continue to remain in a very good range for the first quarter. Velocity continues to set new records, averaging well above 28 miles per hour. And some days, we're seeing numbers in the 30s. Dwell and car efficiency are well positioned in the range we need them for the execution of our transportation service plan. The maintenance sway [ph] and slow order miles are also in a very good sustainable range.","It is also important to mention that while we keep our productivity metrics at record levels, our safety performance continues to improve and remains best-in-class. Operations will continue to scale costs well below the solid growth projections throughout 2013, and we look forward to having a great year. Now I'll turn it over to Pat for the sales and marketing update.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments on Slide 13. As you saw earlier, total revenue in the quarter grew by 1% from last year, while carloads increased by 2%. As Dave Starling previously mentioned, the first quarter revenue and volume growth were lower than the guidance we gave you for the full year back in January.","There are a few important things to consider before you look at the first quarter and draw conclusions for the rest of 2013. First, last year was a leap year, so we had an extra day of revenue in carloadings in 2012.","Second, as Dave Ebbrecht mentioned, Easter was in the first quarter this year -- and the second quarter of 2012, which also contributed to the negative comps. We estimate the impact of these 2 factors was a negative swing in revenue of about $13 million and approximately 17,000 carloads. Excluding those negative factors, revenue and carload growth would have been 2.5% and 3.5%, respectively.","Third, as you can see quite clearly on this slide, our Ag & Minerals business was down significantly from the first quarter of 2012, which was due, as Dave Starling mentioned, to the lingering effect of the drought conditions and the impact on our grain business in the United States last year. Had grain been flat the last year, we would've added another 5% to revenue growth and 2% to carloads. So adding the impact of cross-border grain to the leap year and Easter effect, we would have been in the area of our full year guidance that we gave you in January.","Finally, we had a new administration take office in Mexico in December of 2012. And is normally the case, new budgets are not approved until March of the following year, and government spending is adversely affected. It's not possible to quantify the impact of this on the economy or on our business, but we clearly saw an impact in our some of our business units.","So the point of all this is that we feel the quarter was heavily impacted by timing of certain events and not necessarily a reflection of what we expect for the full year. However, the weakness in grain was definitely more pronounced than we expected, and we now feel that it will be difficult to recover as the year goes on. So that is why we're taking our full year revenue guidance down a notch from what we expected in January. As I'll show you in a few moments, Ag & Minerals is the only business unit where we have reduced our full year revenue guidance.","Revenue per unit increased in 5 of the 6 business units that fell overall due to mix. The main driver here is the shift in mix of our business away from Ag & Minerals, specifically cross-border grain, and growth in intermodal. As I've mentioned in the past, this does not mean that yields, as in contribution or margin, are declining or getting weaker. It simply means that our portfolio mix is shifting and more of our growth came in lower RPU businesses.","Revenue in our Petroleum and Chemical business was flat due to lower volumes, offset by higher RPU. One thing that is probably worth mentioning is that unlike some of the other railroads, we do not have crude oil in our Petroleum and Chemical business unit, so our comps to some of the other railroads are not as bad as they appear on the surface. That said, we did experience some general weakness, as well as some plant maintenance outages in this group during the quarter. We are not seeing trends that would suggest a cyclical turning point, nor are we hearing that from our customer base. We have seen some strengthening in this business in the first 18 days in April, with revenues and volumes higher by 10% and 4%, respectively from last year.","Industrial & Consumer business revenues were up 4% on a similar increase in RPU. Volumes were essentially flat to last year. We had a negative impact of maintenance outages of some of our larger customers during the quarter, which did not occur in the first quarter of 2012. We believe the impact of this was a negative swing of about 1% on revenues and 2% on volume.","I've already spoken about Ag & Minerals, but the story behind the number is that it gives clearly cross-border grain, where we saw revenues fall by 38% and carloads by 31% from last year. We're all well aware of the drought conditions in the U.S. last year. It hit us hard in the last 2 quarters, and we don't expect this situation to improve until possibly September of 2013.","You'll also notice that our results were worse in this business than most of the other rails, and that is because KCS is more heavily concentrated in export corn than the rest of the Class 1s. To put this in perspective, according to USDA data, total U.S. exports of all grains was about 12% lower in the 2012 crop year than 2011. However, export corn was 45% lower than the previous year. So clearly, the corn crop, which is our main staple, was affected worse than other grains.","With that in mind, I will reiterate a comment that I made in the past, and that is our cross-border export corn franchise is very strong and getting stronger and strategically well positioned. There's absolutely nothing wrong or broken with our export corn network. We just didn't have a crop last year. We connect the most productive grain growing region in the world, which is just north of Kansas City, to one of the largest importing regions in the world, which is in Central Mexico. Assuming that we have a decent crop in the U.S. this year, our grain comps should be good in the last 3 to 4 months. But we now expect that Ag & Minerals business unit to be down for the full year, which is the change in the guidance that we gave you in January.","Moving on to Energy. During the first quarter, we did see growth in crude oil, and frac sand more than offset the declines in utility coal. Revenue volume -- the revenue and volumes in utility coal were lower by 7% and 9%, respectively. Overall, our intermodal growth continued at high levels, with revenues increasing by 17% on volume increases of 9%. Our cross-border business represents almost half of our total intermodal growth, and revenues were 70% higher than last year and volumes grew by 81%.","Finally, our Automotive business unit continues to be very strong, with revenues growing by 31% and volumes by 18% over last year. What's exceptional here is that we are still experiencing this kind of growth in automotive in a year that we consider to be a bridge year to the new plants opening in later in 2013 and 2014. I'll provide an update on those plants in a few minutes.","Moving on to Slide 14, cross-border revenues were 10% lower than in the first quarter of last year, and more than all of that decline was attributable to cross-border grain. You may remember that cross-border grain was very strong in the first quarter of last year, which makes our comps this year look even worse. Excluding the impact of grain, our cross-border revenue would've been 11% higher than last year. Cross-border intermodal and automotive continue their strong performance, increasing by 71% and 53%, respectively. As I mentioned last quarter, assuming we have a decent corn crop this year, we should see growth and certainly stronger comps returning in the second half of this year.","Moving on to Slide 15. You can see that our top 5 strategic growth areas continue their strong performance with combined year-over-year revenue growth of 36% versus last year. Together, these businesses represent 19% of our total revenue, and these will be the main drivers of our growth for the next several years. Crude oil, intermodal and automotive were the leaders of the group, with growth rates comparable to what you've seen in prior periods. L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas growth improved from last quarter, as some of the factors we explained to you in January improved or reversed.","Moving on to the market outlook slide, we have updated our revenue guidance from that which we gave you in January. As you can see, our full year guidance is the same in every business unit except for Ag & Minerals. And again, the headline there is cross-border grain. In addition, this guidance is generally consistent with the results we showed for the first quarter back on Slide 13. We have a little bit of catching up to do in Chemical & Petroleum. But for the full year, we still believe we will be in plus territory. As I mentioned earlier, we have seen some strengthening in that group so far in April.","For Ag & Minerals, which I think I have covered pretty completely, we have moved our outlook to low double-digit decline from a single-digit increase that we expected in January. Leaving the outlook for everything else exactly as it was in January, this will take our company -- total company revenue guidance down from high-single to mid-single digits for the full year.","On Slide 16, you can see the year-over-year volume and revenue growth through April 17, which spreads out the impact of Easter and leap year, and we've also adjusted on this slide to remove the impact of cross-border grain. What you can see is that we would have been in the range of full year guidance had it not been for these factors.","Moving on to Slide 18. I put this slide in with the belief that a picture tells a thousand words. We've talked a lot about the new auto plants in Mexico, and this is a very recent photograph of the major new plants. As you can see, with the exception of Audi, which has not yet broken ground, these are all very well along the way to completion. The Nissan plant will begin producing cars this year, and Honda and Mazda will open in the first quarter of 2014. Production from these 4 plants alone will represent a 30% increase in Mexico auto manufacturing.","In addition to these plants, we believe there will be even more auto facilities coming into Mexico over the next few years. And as we've talked in the past, this is a very exciting opportunity for KCS.","Slide 19. I wanted to take a moment to bring everyone up to date on the status of our negotiations regarding the development of a crude oil terminal in Port Arthur, Texas. We've seen heightened discussion in the analyst community, and we just want to make sure everyone understands what we are up to. We are currently in negotiations with a potential partner to develop a unit train unloading and storage terminal on property that KCS owns in Port Arthur. That property is highlighted in red on this map. We are not in a position to identify our partner or discuss details regarding timing, volumes or revenues, so please don't ask questions. What we will discuss are the reasons we are so optimistic about this potential opportunity, and what gives KCS a seat at the crude oil table.","As you can see on this slide, Port Arthur refineries import about 1.7 million barrels of crude oil each day. Because many of the refineries have also invested in coking capacity, there's a natural draw for heavy crude like that produced in Western Canada. Even if or when the Keystone pipeline is completed, we believe it will be able to handle only about half of this demand. The current rail terminal unloading capacity can handle less than 3% of this demand. As I said earlier, we are in negotiations with a potential partner, and we hope to be able to announce the transaction very soon. However, if for whatever reason we don't come to terms with this group, we are confident that other options would be available for us to capitalize on this market opportunity.","Finally, I'll finish with some summary comments about our market outlook. Again, I think I've covered the situation in Ag pretty completely. Our franchise is very strong. But we need a crop, and that is going to take some time. So don't -- we won't see things improve until later in the fall and in the third quarter.","Utility coal comps will begin to look better over the course of the year. We've sort of reached a new normal level in our utility coal business, so the worst is behind us. And growth in the new energy markets will offset the weakness -- any weakness in utility coal going forward.","The pricing environment continues to be good, and we will still see pricing gains in the mid-single-digit range. I think we've covered the auto plants, that are coming on stream in the next 12 months. And we continue to be very excited about the health and growth of our new business pipeline.","With that, I'll turn it over to Mike Upchurch.","Michael W. Upchurch","Thanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 22. Our reported EPS for the quarter was $0.94, and on an adjusted basis is $0.89. And as you know, we began reporting adjusted EPS to exclude the impacts of foreign currency.","During the quarter, we had a net $0.05 benefit due to foreign currency that was comprised of really 2 items. First, the improvement in the peso during the quarter contributed to higher income taxes of approximately $0.03 per share. And I'll provide more information on that impact on the next slide. And then second, during the quarter, we began to hedge this foreign currency risk, and based on the improvement in the peso, had an $0.08 after tax gain primarily related to our hedge.","And I might just comment, as you work through the math on this slide, in Mexico our tax rate is lower; it's 30%. So despite a 38% drop in our grain revenues, our adjusted EPS still grew at a double-digit rate, which we think is impressive earnings growth.","On Slide 23, with respect to our tax rate during the quarter, you can see on the left-hand side of the slide the reconciliation solution from the U.S. statutory rate of 35% to our first quarter effective rate of 34.3%. And I might just comment on a couple of items there. We did in the quarter have some benefits from tax credits, short line tax credits that were signed into law in early January that lowered our effective tax rate by 1.2%. And then, because of the strengthening peso, since December 31, that actually had the impact of increasing our tax expense by 2.3%, as you can see in that red block.","As you probably remember, we are required to revalue, for tax purposes, our U.S. dollar debt that we have in Mexico. So when the peso strengthens, it creates taxable income. And conversely, when the peso declines, it creates at tax deduction. So during the quarter, in the table on the right, you see the peso improved by 40 basis points. And we've given you over kind of a rule of thumb that every 10-basis-point change in the exchange rate usually impacts income taxes by approximately 50 basis points. And you can see that, that relationship held fairly true to form by increasing our effective tax rate by 230 basis points. Historically, this change in income taxes hasn't impacted our cash tax taxes since we haven't been a cash taxpayer. However, that changes in 2013, and we believe hedging that cash tax risk associated with foreign currency swings is in fact a prudent strategy.","And for the year, you can see our guidance in the table in the right, fairly consistent with what we gave you in January, with FX, 36%; without FX, 34%.","On Slide 24, let me give you a little bit more detail on the hedge. What we're trying to show here is the foreign currency hedge helped to offset our higher income tax expense due to the improving peso. In the first quarter column, you can see our first quarter increase in the income tax expense resulting from the revaluation of our U.S. dollar-denominated debt in Mexico. I would note that, that $1 million increase excludes the first quarter impact of retiring the 12.5% notes, also excludes some other differences related to some intercompany debt. And then we had a $3 million after-tax gain on our Mexican peso exposure, which relates to our net monetary assets that we're required to revalue at the balance sheet date.","So our unhedged position in the first quarter would've resulted in about a $2 million income statement gain. However, we did hedge that foreign currency risk, and in the quarter, had an after-tax $6 million gain, so we had a total of $8 million positive benefit to the P&L in the first quarter.","And then in the far right-hand column, what we've tried to illustrate is that given the current exchange rates, we would expect our income tax expense to go up for the year by $8 million. After the peso exposure, it would be an unhedged $6 million loss. And having put the hedge in place essentially mitigates all of that increasing cash taxes. So I think a simple way to think about this is we would've had higher tax expense in the quarter if not for the hedge, and we think that was a prudent strategy to execute.","On Slide 25, let's review our overall expense trends. You can see that we really were flat year-over-year, $390 million a year ago. $390 million in this current quarter. So I think we did a remarkable job managing the expense side of the equation. And we had higher fuel prices in the quarter. We had some negative impact on FX, but that's largely offset from a revenue perspective. We did have the increased depreciation expense due to our higher asset base. And then those were offset by a reduction in compensation expense of $2 million; a $4 million decline in Materials & Other, primarily the result of lower casualty expenses; and $6 million in other declines as a result of cost efficiencies, commodity mix of traffic, and a favorable legal settlement in the first quarter. To give you a little bit of guidance, we do expect depreciation cost to be around $220 million for the full year, that's up slightly from the $215 million we've guided in January as a result of some incremental CapEx spending.","So overall, we think our expense management was exceptionally strong during the quarter, considering that we had a fairly material decline in our grain revenues and did incur some fixed expenses in the quarter around equipment and crude costs that we estimate to be in the neighborhood of $4 million.","On Slide 26, our overall compensation cost declined $2 million year-over-year, largely due to a reduction in the incentive expense. And as Dave has already communicated to you, our average headcount went up 37 employees, but that's less than 1%. And on an average quarterly calculation, about 21 of that increase was the result of the in-sourcing of the track maintenance agreement that will increase compensation but deliver an overall net $5 million a year reduction in our expenses; that offset reduction being in purchased services.","On Slide 27, a couple of points on our fuel expense. You can see our fuel expense went up from $88 million to $91 million. That was largely price driven. You can see in the bar charts that we were at $3.02 in the first quarter compared to $2.84 a year ago. We were relatively flat in our fuel expense on a price per gallon in the U.S. But we did see an increase from $2.54 in the first quarter of 2012 in Mexico to $2.88. So we're still paying less per gallon in Mexico but generally moving closer towards global prices.","On Slide 28, I'll give you a quick update on the use of our cash. As we've communicated previously, our first priority is to continue to invest in our business, to capture our growth opportunity. And in that regard, we have increased our CapEx, the revenue planned spend for the year, to 24%. This increase is largely the result of the incremental spend on equipment to capture the automotive growth that Pat discussed and equipment needs to support our grain franchise.","In terms of optimizing our capital structure, Dave already mentioned that we received the upgrades from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. And we also, during the quarter, retired the 12.5% KCSM notes, partly with cash and partly by drawing down on our credit facility. And we also just last week announced the tender offer for a variety of different issues at our KCSM subsidiary, which I'll review in more detail on the next 2 slides. And then lastly, we announced an increase in our dividend for the first quarter to $0.215.","Finally, on Slides 29 and 30, I wanted to review the key elements of our recapitalization plan that was recently approved by our Board of Directors. First, we currently have a tender offer outstanding, which I'm sure many of you have seen. We're up to $650 million of our KCSM bonds, which currently have coupons of 8%, 6 5\/8% and 6 1\/8%. We have 2 key goals in mind in refinancing this debt. Now that we're investment grade by all the rating agencies, we believe we will be able to access the markets for longer maturities. And our goal would be to extend overall maturities to closely match industry average.","Second, we do expect the lower interest rates and reduce our 2013 interest expense to between $84 million and $88 million. And that's just going to be dependent on the amount of current notes that are tendered, market conditions and specific maturities that we may choose to issue for any new debt. Additionally, depending on market conditions, we may choose to refinance some of our KCSR term loans, which would allow us to extend the maturity. This may actually slightly increase our interest expense because those notes are at less than 2% today, but given the current debt markets, we believe provide us extremely attractive rates. And we think that's a prudent capital management decision.","We may also purchase certain leased equipment and convert those assets to owned assets, continuing a strategy we outlined 2 years ago to take advantage of reducing our exposure to leased assets. But generally, we're at less attractive terms than owning those assets outright.","Overall, we expect to lower our interest expense significantly from peak levels in '09 and would expect the cumulative benefit to be somewhere between $0.10 and $0.15 when compared to 2012 earnings.","And then lastly, on Slide 30, I thought I might take a quick opportunity to provide some additional details. What we've outlined here are various components of the recapitalization. And when you look at the first column, our GAAP debt could actually increase depending on the success of purchasing equipment under lease. While those assets don't really create any incremental financial obligations, we will fund those current off-balance sheet leases with debt, thereby increasing our GAAP debt. However, the rating agencies do include those off-balance sheet leases in their debt calculation, so there's potentially no overall increase in our rating agency debt.","And then finally, in the last column, we have tried to illustrate that while paying off the 12.5% note and refinancing various other notes, we'll provide overall interest expense savings. We could see some slight incremental interest expense by refinancing the term loan, financing assets purchased under lease and any financing of tender premiums and transaction fees. And again, we expect our interest expense to be somewhere in the $84 million to $88 million range. We will get some offsetting benefits in OR because of the reduced leases. We'll provide some further updates on guidance once we complete these transactions.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Dave Starling.","David L. Starling","Thanks, Mike. Before opening up for questions, I'd just like to emphasize that KCS management remains very positive about 2013 and even more bullish than ever about the next few years. Our major growth areas of crude oil, automotive and cross-border intermodal will continue to ramp up. As Pat said, we hope to have more announcements related to crude very soon. Regardless of any announcements, KCS crude business will continue to expand at a high rate. This all-new profitable business should continue to grow.","I'd also mention the new automotive plants. The kind of growth we'll experience with Honda, Nissan and Mazda opening new plants, followed by Audi and then others in 2015 is unprecedented. No railroad has ever before experienced the opening of multiple new plants over a 5-year period, to say nothing of the expansion of the existing ones.","I could go on and on, but I'll end up by saying when you combine the new and expanded business coming online with the opportunity to significantly restructure the company's debt profile and strengthen our balance sheet, it's pretty easy to understand why we at KCS are very bullish about the future.","Now, with that, I'll open it up for questions. I'd like everyone to stay to 2 questions. We've had complaints that some of the analysts don't get their questions in, so we're going to be a little more strict and hold everybody to 2. And as sweet as Ashley is, she's going to cut you off after 2. So with that, let's begin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe your first question, just on the grain side. I see the comps and they do get a little bit easier, I guess, as against the back half of the year. But, Pat, maybe can you give us a little bit of guidance on how we should be thinking about kind of the severity of the declines, at least in the shorter term, call it second quarter or so? Is there anything the changes the dynamic now that you have a new contract I think that started earlier this year. Does anything change the dynamic in the near-term or we're just going to have to wait for September before we see these volumes moving?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","We're going to have to wait till September, Chris, maybe August, with some of the new facilities that's openings further south, where the harvest might be a little earlier. But I think you're going to see a little bit. And if you look at the first quarter revenues, second quarter should be a little bit better, just seasonally. Third quarter will probably be very close to the first quarter. And then we're expecting the fourth quarter to kind of return to historical normals. So the next 2 quarters are going to be weak.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question would just be kind of on the run rate of kind of operating expenses that you have as it stands right now. I think, Dave, you mentioned that you were unable to cut back crews as much as you would have like because you're anticipate better harvest in the back half of the year. Can you give us a sense of kind of how that impacted, I guess, the first quarter or so and maybe how that plays out over the next quarter or 2? I don't know if you have kind of a sense or granular on the number there, but just trying to get a rough sense what it might have done to the OR in the quarter.","David R. Ebbrecht","We're confident that we're going to be able to continue to control the expenses at the rates we have and keep them relatively flat. We're just choosing to hold on to employees to make sure we do training, like putting them in engineered training, and cut them back, different ways that we can keep them engaged, preparing for the third and fourth quarter volumes surges. But it takes us about 3 months to hire employees and then another 4 months to train them. And we think it would be fruitless to go ahead and furlough these employees only then to have to rehire others.","David L. Starling","And, Chris, with the new millennia, if you lay somebody off 30 days after they come out of training and then you call them back in 3 months, they may not come back. They may have said, \"This wasn't the kind of industry I thought it was going to be, I'm going to good move on.\" So Dave and I talked about it. We think it's a prudent decision. And then when the harvest does come and volumes are there, we'll have ample crews to move them. This could be a great fourth quarter on grain if the weather cooperates.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with JP Morgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, Pat, I'm going to ask you something. I'm not sure if you can you give any directional color on it and you can probably guess where it's going. But the crude by rail, is there a time frame where you, say, you've got this discussion with one kind of unidentified party, is there a time frame that you put on that and if it doesn't kind of come to fruition, then you move onto the next? Or is there any kind of time frame you have in mind that's reasonable for getting an agreement? Is this kind of a 1-year process and that shouldn't be longer than that? Or just any kind of commentary you can provide on how we should think about the timing for a potential agreement.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I think it's a matter of a few weeks. Let me say it this way. And again, we are in good negotiations. It's been very high-level participation, Dave and the CEO on the other side. And I don't -- we really don't expect that there are any major differences in terms of wrapping this up. But I think we'll know with this party in a matter of a few weeks.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And so that's -- that could -- it could work or it could be the case, you have to move on, but at least that resolution with the current party would be just a couple of weeks?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Correct.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, let's see. And the second question, you showed us some pictures on the auto plants, which is very helpful. It looks like there's a lot of work that's been done on 3 of those. How would you view the -- I guess there's some noise recently in terms of the yen weakening and how that might affect the outsourcing strategy for some of the Japanese manufacturers. 3 of the 4 plants are Japanese manufacturers. Do you think there's any risk at all related to the yen weakness on those 3 plants? Or do you think in the future that would affect at all the opportunity in Mexico?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I don't see it, Tom. I was in Mexico visiting with a couple of our automotive customers, including visiting the Nissan site at Aguascalientes. We did not hear any reversal, any indication that they are weakening their view of Mexico. There are a lot of other reasons why the auto companies are choosing Mexico just other than currency: labor costs, which is impacted by currency; the fact that Mexico has more free trade agreements than any other country in the world. So they're looking at Mexico primarily to serve the U.S. market, but they're looking at Mexico more and more to serve other markets in South America, other markets in the world; transit costs, et cetera. So there are more factors than just currency, but the direct answer to your question, Are we seeing or hearing anything that would suggest a weakening of the enthusiasm or interest in putting plants in Mexico? No. I've mentioned this in the past as well. But in addition to the big auto plants, there are a large number of Tier 1, Tier 2 suppliers going in to support these plants. I drove -- several weeks ago, Dave and I were in Mexico. We drove past an industrial park in the Salaya area, which is near the Honda and Mazda facility. There were 8 or 9 buildings going up in that facility simultaneously. And eventually, Honda told us there will be 19 Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers locating in that facility. So the ripple effect is pretty big with finished vehicles, and we just aren't seeing any indications that the enthusiasm for Mexico is waning.","David L. Starling","Tom, this is Dave. One thing I might add, the other thing we're learning about the plants is they have additional capacity, additional expansion property, so they are already -- when they built this, it's almost like it's in phases. So they all have bigger footprints to expand into at a later time; so, very encouraging for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","While we're on the topic of automotive, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the Port of Veracruz and the expected build-out of infrastructure? I know in the past you talked about a targeted completion sometime in mid-2013, so I was wondering if that's still on track. And at this point, do you have a better sense of what share you might be able to capture there?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Allison, the rail project is under way at Veracruz will be finished by the end of this year and operational when the new plants open. So the rail access for us in and out of the Port of Veracruz is going to be improved. The one thing that we aren't seeing and so far we haven't seen any movement is announcements about additional terminal capacity being built at Veracruz. So the rail access will improve our ability to serve Veracruz, but for finished vehicles, the Port of Veracruz is pretty congested. They're going to need to do more than just improve the rail access to add capacity there. And we just haven't seen any announcements. We know they have plans at the Port of Veracruz to add both finished vehicle terminals as well as intermodal terminals, but their plan is to finance that with private capital through concessions. And at this moment, they do not have even a bid package out in the market for a concession for intermodal or automotive. So we're struggling to kind of understand how this is going to change the landscape at Veracruz. The rail access will be better, but the bottleneck will still be the terminal capacity for finished vehicles and intermodal.","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe this is a question for Jos\u00e9. There's been a lot of talk recently about energy reform in Mexico and the potential liberalization of PEMEX under the new administration. I was wondering if you could divide any perspective on what you're hearing in this regard, and what it could potentially mean for KSU over the longer term.","Jos\u00e9 L. Zozaya","Yes, the lobbyists [ph] just last night, they finalized that -- they have submitted [ph] the reforms on the telecommunications law. They are working one by one, and it is expected that the next one to start working on will be the energy reform. There is a lot of expectation on that. They say they have an agreement between the different parties. And we think that after that reform is approved, there's going to be a lot of new investments and growing in that business and mainly a lot of foreign investments coming in to do some certain kind of contracts. It's not that PEMEX is going to be privatized, but a lot of the works that PEMEX is doing internally now is going to be shared in a different ways, or as in fact what I've been hearing, are for different companies. And that could be providing certain and different kind of services for the company. And especially they will be looking also for more drilling in deep waters also. I don't know if that answered your question or you want to ...","Allison M. Landry - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The increased foreign investment with, say, its U.S. companies or that sort of thing. That does answer my question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Pat, maybe you can just start off on the grain crop a bit. It seems like you kind of gave guidance in January, but if the crop runs from kind of August to July or somewhere thereabouts, what got much worse that you have to go back here in April and change the outlook? I guess, just what changed within the last 3 months, given that we're still within that same crop year?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","What changed was really in Mexico. What we expected to happen was that the U.S. side of our business would be weak because we knew and understood fairly well, pretty well, the growing conditions and the inventory, et cetera, in our origination territory. What we expected was more movement in Mexico coming from other carriers and pulling grain off of their regions. So that didn't happen. In other words, we expected more grain could be coming to us at the border that we would move in Mexico. And so we underestimated the severity of the drought and the crop -- and the impact on the crop in other parts of the U.S. So that was the surprise for us.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I appreciate the insight. Quite clear. Then, Michael, you talked about kind of the sourcing contract opportunities over time. Is there -- as you look to continue to improve that operating ratio, are there other opportunities or sizable ones that are -- we're going to see step functions? Or is this more kind of rolling additional ones in? I'm just wondering if there's some large opportunities left on the table here.","Michael W. Upchurch","Yes, there are still a number of equipment maintenance related contracts that we continue to believe we can pursue better rates on, either with the outsourced provider or in-sourcing that. So, but plenty of opportunity ahead of us.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Anything, I guess, near term?","David L. Starling","Let me answer that one. The date to these contracts, the companies we deal with know the dates. It's much better for us to tell you after it's done than talk about it before or in the middle of the negotiations.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess for variety, maybe return to the auto franchise story, strong auto growth even in the period, with volume up 18%. I guess as we think about the 4 sort of unprecedented plants coming out in such a quick pace, can you comment on the rail's position relative to other alternative modes or railroads as far as capturing most or all of this volume? Can you give us some direction on maybe the magnitude of what annual increases these might represent to the franchise? Like within the next 3 or 4 years, is this 5% or 10% gain for the auto franchise? Or what sort of order of magnitude do you think, given the likely share?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Well, I'll talk in terms of the impact of the overall market and kind of stick to some of the guidance that we've given in the past. But if you look at the 4 plants and then we know there are more coming on, but just look at the 4 plants that I highlighted in the slide. The finished vehicle production at those plants alone will represent about a 35% increase in auto production in Mexico. We have, at the plants that we serve today, we have anywhere from 25% to 80% of the market on a plant-by-plant basis. We don't know in the case of these 4 because the awards are not complete. We don't know yet what our market share is going to be, but if you look at our network, we are very well positioned to serve these plants and move vehicles to the population centers in the Eastern half of the country. Laredo is the best gateway to move these vehicles to where they ultimately want to go, which is the big population centers in the Southeast, in the Midwest and the East Coast. So again, putting that in perspective, these 4 plants will increase finished vehicle production by 35% over the next 3 or 4 years. Now, if you look at our Automotive business, what we call automotive is just finished vehicles and some auto parts moving in boxcars. When you look at the ripple effect and look at what is auto related in our revenue base, we have estimated and said previously that it's about 16% to 18% of our total revenues are auto related. So that would be finished vehicles. That would be intermodal auto parts that show up in our intermodal business unit. It would be steel, plastics, all kinds of other components that are related to finished vehicle production. So the punchline is, the market that we serve in Mexico, the production of finished vehicles is increasing by 35% over the next 3 to 4 years. And our auto-related businesses is 16% to 18% of our total revenue.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. If it could switch to a quick operations question. In the last couple of quarters, it would seem operations is really hitting on all cylinders, with velocity in '12, 28 miles an hour in 17 or 18 hours. Can you see further improvement from these excellent rates or what would this require?","David R. Ebbrecht","I would say that our operating metrics are operating at peak efficiency right now, with the current volumes that we're seeing. We look at velocity as a range that we want to stay in to be able to execute our service plans. And it really depends where we're looking at, but as we accommodate higher and higher growth, what we'd like to do is make sure we keep in that range. And we should see slight dips from -- every now and then, but if we're in the 27 to 28 range of velocity numbers, we're very satisfied that, that enables us to be able to make our connection plans from terminal to terminal.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to ask a question on efficiency and the impact on the operating ratio. With the lower outlook for Ag volume and Ag revenue, does that impact the level of efficiency gains and operating ratio gains you can get this year? Does that just make it a little bit tougher now?","David R. Ebbrecht","I would say that we have a lot of opportunities out there to reduce cost across multiple areas of our expense controls. And we're continuing to refine our operations and look for those areas such as fuel, equipment turn time, utilization and other areas in the network that we can take out costs from, not to mention some of the maintenance contracts that Mike just referred to. So there are still opportunities out there. But grain, as we know, with us owning the equipment and as it does not move, we will absorb some increased expenses that we have to overcome in other areas.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just shift gears a little bit. Pat, intermodal growth was pretty good in the quarter. But sequentially, we've been down on absolute terms 2 quarters in a row now. Obviously, that's a lot of seasonality. But should we expect you guys to be exceeding peak volume levels as we had through the second and third quarter in the intermodal business?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Exceed peak volume levels?","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, from the last third quarter?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes. I mean, you look quarter -- year-over-year, we're still seeing nice increases. The cross-border is still the smaller bucket of our main pieces of business in the intermodal business unit, but it's growing faster, and so we would expect those growth rates to come down at some point. But I think overall, we'll see our intermodal business grow on a year-over-year basis.","David L. Starling","I think what you -- as the base gets bigger, we're very happy with double digit.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Pat, some of this we were talking about a lot last year was with the whole coal issue and, obviously, with that, gas prices up, I'm curious, number one, if you're seeing any reaction in the utilities. So do you feel like the stockpiles at a point where we're pretty good on the forward outlook for coal for you? But also, can you update us on -- there were some talk that you might have some plant closures? And I'd just love the update there as well?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes. Our stockpiles are probably a little higher than normal across the network. But we are seeing and hearing from our coal customers that the outlook is brighter, with gas prices being where they are today that the mood among our utility customers seems to be brighter. And the talk of plant closures also seems to be diminishing a bit. We have one plant that announced that they were shutting down a couple of their generating units until the peak summer season. They are still indicating that they're going to open that -- those units up for the summer, and so we're still somewhat dependent on the weather in that case. But the overall mood and the outlook that we're hearing from our utility customers is better, certainly better than it was a year ago. You'll see our comps recently are very strong because we were sort of at the depth of the depression this time last year. So our coal comps are going to be decent for the rest of the year.","David Berge - Moody's Corporation, Research Division","Okay, great. And, Mike, just one quick question on materials. Is this a good run rate? Because this was down quite a bit from last year, as well as where we were modeling. So I think you mentioned a casualty adjustment. Is this a good run rate to you going forward?","Michael W. Upchurch","Yes, it's priced slightly higher than what we saw in the first quarter, but there are a lot of different items that run through materials and other, but we did have a true-up in the first quarter on small casualties.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the lease-to-own strategy on locomotives. You mentioned that briefly in the remarks. But I'm wondering if this is something that kicks in more during 2014 and beyond, just given your somewhat elevated CapEx levels this year. And if you could just walk through how you see that playing out in terms of timing and how that 80-20 split could change over time and the cost savings associated with that.","Michael W. Upchurch","Yes, this is Mike. We've talked about this for the last 2 years. And clearly, over time we have leased more equipment than we've gone out to acquire and own. And generally, that's done at not as favorable of a term. And as our balance sheet's improved, it gives us the ability, I think, to go in as these leases roll off and begin to acquire those assets, and we should see some nice improvement, both from an NPV perspective and in the P&L, particularly in operating ratio. It's a situation where some of these leases are longer-term leases. They could go out 8, 10 years. So it may take us a little while to go from 80-20 lease-to-own to 50-50, which is closer to what the industry average is. But when you look at our equipment rents as a percent of revenue, they're about 300 basis points higher than the rest of the industry. And so over the next few years, we think there is an opportunity to maybe pick up a couple hundred -- 200 basis points, somewhere in that range, in operating ratio improvement. And we've done some of that, as we've announced, and we have the potential to do some others. But I wouldn't want to say too much more because we are actively looking at some of those transactions right now. But it will definitely help us close the gap in operating ratio.","David L. Starling","Justin, this is Dave. I'd might add to that, that this is not a 1- or a 2-year strategy. This is a multiyear strategy because we don't want to pay penalties to these leasing companies. We're just going to be opportunistic when the leases come up. And also, instead of leasing equipment now, we're purchasing. So I think that's, again, something that we couldn't or wouldn't do on in the past. So that moves the needle very slightly, but it's going to be multiple years before we get to that 50-50.","Justin Long - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. I appreciate that. That's helpful, helpful detail. I was also wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing at L\u00e1zaro and your expectations there going forward. I know fourth quarter was a little bit of a disappointment and there were some onetime items. We saw modest volume gains in the first quarter. But do you still have confidence that volume growth in -- from that port will re-accelerate closer to the double-digit levels or so that we've seen historically?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Well, yes, they will recover. Keep in mind that for the better part of 4 years, L\u00e1zaro was growing faster than any port in North America. And as is usually the case when you have that kind of performance versus the same period of time. Sooner or later, it's going to converge back to a more normal level. And I think we're seeing a little bit of that. But I mean, the outlook for L\u00e1zaro is extremely positive. Hutchison is investing and adding capacity at their terminal. I think I told you back in January that they're adding 6 ship-to-shore cranes before -- sometime in the second quarter. APM just had their groundbreaking. They've announced they're going to spend $900 million dollars over the next few years building a second concession container terminal. So the outlook at L\u00e1zaro is very positive. It's going to be a great growth area for us for many years to come. There's a new auto facility going on there, but we should probably get used to and expect that growth rates are going to decline just because they have been so high for several years. There is nothing wrong about L\u00e1zaro. It's everything we've said in the past. There's just an abundance of land, it's natural deep water. The port authority has done a terrific job building out infrastructure, rail infrastructure that we benefit from but haven't had to pay for, highways, bypasses, bridges. It's just a phenomenal place.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I kind of wanted to ask on a grain side whether we might see any changes to trade patterns. And maybe more explicitly, could you give us an idea of what percent of your grain moves are from Canadian producers that go cross border to Mexico, and could we see greater opportunities to diversifying your grain business?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","For us to diversify? Is that what you're asking? Is there opportunities for us to diversify our grain business?","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Correct, yes.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Well, it's one of those things where we are kind of -- what's the phrase? -- we are where we are, and so we can only draw from certain territory. In a commodity market, you're not going to move grain a lot of distance out of route from its normal pattern. So we are primarily a corn railroad. Some of the things that are happening and we -- some of the things are happening this year that we've talked about that will improve our origination capability are the 2 new elevators that are opening this year in time for harvest, one in Western Missouri and one in Western Illinois. So those are very important strategic investments that our customers and partners are making, and they will improve our ability to control originations on our network. And this is obviously a ridiculous thing to say, but had those facilities been open last year, we would have been in a much different place right now with our origination capability. But as far as expanding, we haven't seen -- we don't draw a lot of grain out of Canada. There's some talk with the change in the Canadian Wheat Board that maybe moving wheat down into Mexico from Western Canada would be possible. We'd certainly like to do that if things develop a certain way, but we haven't seen it yet.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. If I could switch topics and ask Mike with regards to the depreciation rate. Could we assume that what we -- that what we had seen in the first quarter could continue? Is that the sort of the pace in terms of your overall run rate [indiscernible] incremental increase of depreciation like revenue, as an example?","Michael W. Upchurch","Yes, it's really a function of our capital spend for these growth opportunities. I did make a comment to give some guidance on depreciation, and I stated it was $220 million for the year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Assuming that Port Arthur is built out something like the discussions that are taking place now, what do you think your mix of Canadian versus, say, Bakken crude is going to be over the next couple of years? And then my follow-up question is, what are some of the dynamics we need to think about with the Canadian crude coming South? And I'm thinking about it as, CN, for example, can come pretty far south. So where did they need to come onto your network? Where don't they have to? And maybe if you could put some color on that, that would be appreciated.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay, if you look at our mix of crude oil right now, it's about -- it's well balanced, actually, between Canadian, Bakken and West Texas. So we would expect to see going forward for the next 2 to 3 years, probably a good mix, maybe something like 40% Canada, 40% Bakken and 20% West Texas. Longer term, we think the business that's probably more sustainable over the long haul is Western Canada, because the Port Arthur market is a little more biased towards heavy Canadian -- heavy crude because of the coking facilities that the refiners have there. We're working with both CN and CP. The CP can originate Western Canada and Bakken over Kansas City. And CN can originate Western Canada over Jackson, Mississippi, which is our main interchange point with CN. But certainly, CN gets down into to the Gulf Coast, so they will be delivering crude oil to their own termination facilities, but they don't get to Port Arthur. And Port Arthur wants the crude. So we would expect to take Western Canadian crude to Port Arthur over Kansas City and Jackson.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So a couple for Pat first. In terms of the new auto plants coming online over the next year or so, can you -- when do we get a sense on if you guys are going to be moving those volumes North to the border? How do we think about that? And just one other thing on Mexico for you, Pat. How does your network align if we start to see a shale and oil development down in Mexico?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay, on the autos, Scott, I think as I said, our network is very well positioned, if you look at where these vehicles are made and where they want to go, which is the population centers in the U.S. About 80% of the vehicles generally at these new plants are going to go for export, and most of that will be U.S., some Canadian, Eastern Canada, where, again, we've got -- our network is very well oriented to move into Eastern Canada and some to South America. So we will move some of these vehicles to L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. In fact, one of the manufacturers we're looking at using L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, moving onto vessels to go to the West Coast of the United States. So the distribution pattern is different for each plant. But again -- and the awards have not been made, so we can't be very specific about market shares and routings and all of that at this point. But our network really is the main attraction and just very well oriented to move these vehicles from where they're made to where they're going to be sold. Same thing, though, for our parts. We move a lot of auto parts down into these plants, both from the U.S., the Great Lakes region, as well as from Asia coming in through L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas. Second, on crude oil, in Mexico, we get pretty frothy when we think about the opportunities here. And I don't know if you've seen this. In some of the presentations I've given recently, I show a photograph, a Google Earth shot, that I saw a few months ago flying down to Mexico. Then if you look down on a clear day in South Texas, you see just dozens or hundreds of little white dots on the landscape which are all the drill pads in South Texas. Then you cross the Rio Grande and there's nothing. So you know there's oil and gas in that part of Mexico. In fact, some of the geological estimates say that Northern Mexico has more significant, more substantial reserves than the Eagle Ford region in Texas. We're very well positioned to serve that, both with crude oil and frac sand and other materials going in. So as Dave mentioned, the current administration is very interested in opening that market and exploring that opportunity with private capital. We don't know exactly what that's going to involve or the timing, but if they do open up, and you see northern Mexico develop anywhere near where the Eagle Ford region is today, that will be a big opportunity for us. We've already started talking to potential partners, transload operators, who are very interested and eager to get into that market. But the timing of that is uncertain at this point. It could be big.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","Yes, that's great color, Pat. Just to follow up real quickly on the auto question, because there are new plants, do you feel like you can have better...","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Scott, you've had your 2. It's gone long. The next caller.","Operator","At this time, we've reached the end of our allotted time for Q&A. We have time for one final question, which should be coming from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","A quick question, and it's more regarding on the capital spending side. One, with all these auto plants coming online, are we going to see a slight uptick in some of the spending for you guys? And if so, where?","David L. Starling","This is Dave. I think you're going to see it. We're already starting to accumulate AutoMax cars. That's the preferred car for the Mexico auto manufacturers that provides a lot of protection. It's got a very high utilization. We've been able to run that car in closed loops between some of the plants down to L\u00e1zaro for export and bring imports back in. So we've added substantial cars this year. You'll see us continue to do that. We're also relooking at our grain fleet. We have a lot of older leased cars. We may start to roll out of that. That may be one group that we want to perhaps own 50% of the cars. Fortunately for us, on the crude side, all we have to do is provide locomotives, so we're well positioned at the locomotive side. We've got pre-approval from our board to upsize our local fleet based on opportunities or revenue. So it's going to be a moving target, but it's all going to be justified by growth.","Jason H. Seidl - Cowen Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the next question is actually one -- is an incoming one that I just got. With the auto plants relocating, I mean, is it going to shift the supply chain around for where the parts are going? And do think that you might lose some of your parts traffic anywhere or are you going to potentially pick up some parts traffic?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I think we will pick up some parts traffic. And initially, I think you'll see it coming from Asia to the port of L\u00e1zaro. But we don't see anything in the distribution, the flow of parts to the plant that we're serving that are going to be negatively affected by the new plants. We think we're going to get growth in parts, in steel. We're already seeing it. I think I showed 2 or 3 quarters ago an update on the steel plants that are being built in Mexico to serve the new plants, the new auto plants. So at this point, we kind of see that whole ripple effect as being a positive for us.","Operator","Mr. Starling, I turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","David L. Starling","I know the call has gone long. And I appreciate everyone's patience. And I appreciate you keeping it down to 2 questions. I think it's helped everyone participate. We hope that the length of the call is because everyone has a lot of interest in our company and our growth, but we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K of the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS Web site, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Thank you. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","David L. Starling","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Kansas City Southern's first quarter 2016 earnings call. Joining me today are KCS President, Pat Ottensmeyer; Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Songer; Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Upchurch. And joining us by phone President and Executive Representative of KCSM, Jose Zozaya.","A quick look at our overview of first quarter. KCS revenues declined by 7% from a year ago. Of course a weak peso and lower U.S. fuel prices had significant impact on the top line. When you exclude those factors, our revenues were down 1% from first quarter 2015. In addition to these factors, we were hit with serious flooding on parts of our network in Texas and Louisiana beginning in mid-March, which had a noticeable negative impact on the revenues for the quarter.","Despite all of these challenges, as well as the 5% reduction in carloads, KCS posted an adjusted operating ratio for the quarter of 66.6, a 2.3 point improvement over the prior year. A few comments on the flood and impacts of three critical corridors of our railroads being out of service for over three weeks. We were very pleased with our ability to keep a lot of the trains moving during those three weeks and get our system up and running as quickly as it did. It\u2019s a testament to Jeff Songer and his operating team and to the exceptional coordination between operations, marketing and sales personnel keeping our customers impacted on their cargo movement.","It also speaks to a high degree of cooperation between KCS and other railroads, particularly the Union Pacific and BNSF who were battling their own flood-related problems as well. We detoured trains on our own respective networks to minimize the effect to our customers. We were also assisted by Canadian National. We may be fierce competitors on most days but when hit with financial disasters, railroads work together to keep the freight moving to the greatest extent possible. It was a great effort.","My final thought is that to be able to improve your operating ratio by over 2 points while losing an important part of your rail system for nearly a month and without the benefits for incremental volume growth is a real noteworthy achievement and should give you all confidence in KCS organization and particularly our operating team going forward.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat Ottensmeyer.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 7. Dave gave you a summary of our first quarter results. Jeff, Brian and Mike will get into a lot more detail on the following slides. What I would like to do in the next few slides is provide more of an assessment or evaluation of our performance during the quarter and talk briefly about our longer term outlook.","Sticking with the general theme from our fourth quarter earnings presentation, we will focus our comments this morning more on those factors that we can manage to drive performance in an uncertain and volatile economic environment; things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure.","Overall, we feel that our performance in the first quarter was very good in spite of continued headwinds from energy markets, specifically coal and crude oil, fuel prices and foreign exchange, as Dave mentioned, all of which had a negative impact on volumes and\/or revenues during the quarter.","In addition, KCS revenues and volumes were negatively impacted by heavy rain, flooding and service interruptions that essentially shutdown parts of our Southern region and our cross-border route in March. Jeff will have to say about that in a few minutes.","Returning to the first quarter assessment, until about March 9, we were all feeling pretty good about the pace of business this year although I would say the phrase we were using to describe our first quarter at that point was worse than last year but better than expected. Then the rain started and we experienced severe and in some regions record-breaking flooding in Louisiana and Texas.","As you will see on the following slide, our year-to-date volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9 where they were up 1% versus last year. Then we went underwater. The reduction in volumes during the last 22 days of the quarter took our volumes for the full quarter from a 1% increase at March 9 to a 5% decline by the end of the quarter. Not all of that decline was due to the flooding. There were other factors including the timing of the Easter holiday, which contributed to the weak 2016 comps.","In spite of that dramatic flood impact, our operations team demonstrated excellent performance of the things we did control such as service, cost, finance utilization to drive the 230 basis point improvement in operating ratio from last year. Again, as Dave mentioned, the other positive factor that allowed us to manage our network and keep customer service and asset utilization at reasonable levels was the degree of cooperation we saw from our railroad partners, many of whom are also affected by flooding on their network.","I don\u2019t think it would be an overstatement to say that the level of coordination and cooperation we saw from our rail partners in Texas and Louisiana was better than at any time we can remember in the last 10 years. All of us were in the same situation and we used each other\u2019s networks in a way that was purely focused on taking care of customers and keeping our collective networks running in the most efficient manner possible.","Before I leave this slide, I want to acknowledge the announcement we made on March 10 appointing Jeff Songer to Chief Operating Officer. I feel this organizational change whereby we aligned all of the key operation function; transportation, engineering and mechanical under a single functional unit will allow KCS to drive further improvement in customer service, cost control and asset utilization and ultimately help us achieve our long-term operating ratio and ROIC target.","I\u2019ll come back to this theme of organizational development in a couple of minutes. Slide 8 illustrates the point I made earlier that our volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9. This chart further illustrates the significant impact that the flood and service interruption among other factors had on our quarterly volumes, which finished 5% lower than last year. I\u2019m happy to report that this business recovery has continued. Volumes for the second quarter have returned to positive territories. You can see here, as of last Friday we were up about 3% versus last year.","I\u2019ll wrap up with Slide 9. You may remember this graphic from our fourth quarter 2015 earnings presentation in January. At that time, which was the first time we introduced this slide, we told you that this was going to be our primary guidance statement going forward. Given the uncertainty that we continued to see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive driven by growth in several key market areas, positive pricing trends and sustainable improvement in service, cost control and asset utilization.","And as we see in the center of this slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. The short-term outlook continues to be very uncertain and as a result we\u2019re just not in a position to provide more definitive or specific guidance regarding volume, revenues or operating ratio. Growth will return. Investments in chemical plant, auto production, port terminals and now refined product facilities that has taken place in our service area is quite remarkable. Brian will highlight some very recent announcements on new business opportunities in a few minutes.","In 2016, we continue to forecast a reduction in overall capital spending but we will spend on those key projects to support the industrial development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When those new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities that we know are coming over the longer term horizon.","Earlier I said I would come back to the organizational development theme. In addition to the personnel and organizational changes that we have made publicly, there have been several other internal organizational changes involving lead or department head positions in PTC, purchasing, network design, internal audit, financial planning and tax.","I\u2019m extremely pleased to report that each of these positions involving Vice President or Assistant Vice President level jobs was made with individuals who were already at KCS. This is a phenomenon that hasn\u2019t always been the case here in the past as many of you have followed us for some time are aware. It is a testament not only to the quality of our people but our management commitment to develop and promote high performers to become the leaders for the next generation.","Our people at all levels of the organization match up very well with our larger industry peers and most importantly they are a talented and dedicated group and that is the critical ingredient to delivering the high performance expectations to which our customers and shareowners hold us.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the presentation over to Jeff.","Jeffrey M. Songer","Thank you, Pat, and good morning. Beginning with Slide 11, strong operating performance in the quarter allowed for improvements in key operating metrics. Velocity for the quarter was 28 miles per hour, a 3.2% improvement over prior year and a 3.5% improvement over Q4 2015.","Overall dwell for the quarter of 21.1 hours was a 7.8% improvement over prior year. Despite significant impacts during the flood in March, we were able to achieve substantial improvements in both the operating metrics and cost control, as we will discuss. The organizational changes discussed last quarter are fully in place and we are seeing the results.","Moving to Slide 12, efforts in resource management and cost control are showing results. In Mexico, our workforce is stable and operating metrics have largely returned to expected levels. Furthermore, improved cycle times have led to reduced car hire expense. In U.S., we continue our focus on resource management. Currently, 12% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status and 12% of our locomotives are in storage.","Highlighting other cost initiatives, we have started to fuel optimization technology program and have accelerated capital funding to allow us to install this technology in approximately 20% of our road fleet by the end of 2016. We continue to improve Mexico workload allowing for crew efficiencies. Ongoing projects such as reducing crew change points in areas such as Leal, which will improve run times between Monterrey and the border and modifying operations in the Escobedo area will ease congestion and prove fluidity in this area.","In the U.S., crew management efforts such as eliminating the Jackson, Mississippi crew change and another ongoing initiatives have allowed us to reduce our year-over-year number of re-crews by 37% across the network. Additionally, we continue to improve our mechanical maintenance agreement. You will see the financial benefit of our work today in Mike\u2019s portion of the presentation and we are working on additional opportunities notably with our Mexico car shop operations that we look to benefit from for the latter part of the year.","Looking at our major capital projects, all are progressing to plan. Our work at Sanchez continues and will complement the work completed in 2015 by adding classification tracks and more efficient maintenance facilities. The Sasol support yard project is on schedule. We have finalized the bid process. Our contract has been selected and construction is underway.","Construction of additional receiving and departing tracks in L\u00e1zaro will support improved departures, run times and length of trains originating from the yard. This additional capacity will also support APMT terminal opening later this year.","San Luis Potosi has become an additional area of focus driven by new commercial opportunities. We are in the design process for capacity improvements in this area to support recently announced facilities, which Brian will discuss.","Turning to Slide 13, I will close out my comments by providing a quick overview of the flood event in March. As you can see from the map we incurred multiple days of outages across our major East West and North South routes in between Shreveport and New Orleans, essentially the lower half of our U.S. system including cross-border operation.","I would like to recognize the coordination efforts during the flood between KCS and our connecting carriers, most notably, the Union Pacific and BNSF but also CN and CSX. I\u2019m proud of the industry response for this event. We were able to route other carriers\u2019 traffic on our network as we routed our trains across their networks, all in efforts of maintaining the most efficient operation for our customers.","Finally, I want to thank our operating team for the extra effort working multiple days and nights on end to restore our network after this event and for delivering strong operating performance for the quarter.","I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock.","Brian Hancock","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the Southeastern U.S. primarily impacted our intermodal, industrial and consumer and chemical and petroleum business segment. In spite of this disruption, our year-over-year revenue was down 1% excluding currency and fuel while our carloads for the quarter were down 5%.","In Q1, we also continued to turn to solid performance with our core pricing results coming in at 3.8%. The commercial team also expressed our appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of our operating and customer service organization for providing real-time options for our customers and closely working with our other rail partners during these extraordinary weather events.","I\u2019ll now provide a little more detail by line of business using Slide 15 as a reference. Our chemicals and petroleum business continues to show steady growth with a 3% volume increase and 2% revenue increase driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business partially offset by the impact of the flood.","Industrial and consumer while also negatively impacted by flooding still showed a 1% increase in volume but had a 3% decline in revenue primarily due to the impact of currency and fuel. Softness in both our metals and paper segment had a significant impact in Q1 but we\u2019re seeing some improvements as our customers are finding new markets for their products. Additionally, we saw strength in our other carload segment.","During Q1, our ag and mineral business saw increases of 4% in both volume and revenue driven by strength in grain particularly in the cross-border business. Our energy line of business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in coal and crude. Overall carloads were down 16% and revenue down 37% versus first quarter of 2015 with coal making up about 52% of the miss.","Intermodal volumes were down 7% with revenue decreasing 10% in the quarter. While our intermodal trains are now running at expected service levels, the volume has been slow and ramping back up. As expected, intermodal was negatively impacted by the retooling and shutdowns at a number of the automotive assembly plants, and as Pat mentioned we were also impacted by more competitive truck pricing in several markets as well as the flooding in the Southeast. These items combined with differences in holiday timing in China and North America also impacted our Q1 intermodal as well.","While the automotive segment had a number of positive events early in the quarter due to specific customer needs and unplanned movement, the planned temporary plant shutdowns were primary drivers of declines of 12% in volume and 11% in adjusted revenue, respectively. We continue to be on track with our expectations for the downtime at the automotive plant and both of these projects are proceeding as planned.","We expect that all of our customers\u2019 facilities will be back on line in May. I want to reiterate that these outages had impacted both our intermodal and automotive business segments. After the retooling is complete, there will be a gradual ramp-up period before all of the quality and new model issues are resolved, but we continue to be optimistic about our automotive business.","On Slide 16, we have provided details on several announcements that were made during the first quarter. As we have previously discussed, the 2013 Mexico Energy Reform legislation allows companies to import refined products into Mexico beginning in 2017 under private brands other than Pemex. KCS along with several of our partners in the industry have been working towards those implementation dates.","On February 22, 2016, the President of Mexico announced the acceleration of these reforms which should allow import to begin on April 1, 2016. As a result of this announcement, WTC industrial and Watco companies announced that they will be building a liquid fuels terminal in San Luis Potosi on the KCS line. Shipments for this terminal are expected to begin in 2017.","Just a few weeks later, Rangeland Energy announced that it is developing an integrated hydrocarbon logistics facility to store and ship LPG gasses into Mexico. This facility will also begin shipping in 2017. Finally, as a follow up to our last call, Ford announced that it will be investing $1.6 billion in a new assembly plant in San Luis Potosi just across from the new BMW facility. Ford has announced that this plant will primarily focus on the North American small vehicle market and is expected to open in 2018.","We also continue our plans and investments for the opening of the new APM terminal in Lazaro Cardenas later in 2016. As you can see the business development pipeline continues to provide numerous opportunities for growth in several of our key industry segments. We will continue to work with our customers and other organizations to provide quality, supply chain solutions in the markets that they serve.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Michael W. Upchurch","Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I\u2019m going to begin my comments on Slide 18. First quarter volumes declined 5% and revenue declined by 7%. Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices. Excluding those impacts, revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter.","The significant peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on revenues during the quarter. Declining U.S. fuel prices contributed an additional $17 million decline in revenue. These declines were partially offset by positive pricing impacts.","Moving to adjusted operating ratio, we saw a decline by 230 basis points to 66.6%. Despite the revenue decline, adjusted operating income was flat reflecting foreign exchange benefits, lower fuel costs and good expense controls during the quarter particularly in our operating group.","Reported EPS was $0.99 per share and adjusting for FX benefit or impacts adjusted EPS was $1.03 flat to 2015. And we have provided more P&L details in the Appendix including foreign exchange, income taxes, interest expense and share count.","Moving to Slide 19, to provide some insight into future revenue trends, which we expect will continue to be pressured as a result of year-over-year peso depreciation and lower fuel prices, Slide 19 shows first quarter actual and 2Q through 4Q forecast for peso depreciation and U.S. fuel price.","With respect to the peso, projections for the year would indicate an average exchange rate of approximately 17.5, which would represent a 15%, 7% and 5%, respectively, decline in the peso for the remaining quarters of the year.","As shown in the Appendix on Slide 29, approximately 16% of our first quarter revenues were denominated in pesos and therefore subject to revaluation resulting in a 3 percentage point revenue decline.","Also depicted on Slide 29, I would remind everyone that peso denominated expenses largely offset peso denominated revenues and therefore our impact to operating income was insignificant.","With respect to U.S. fuel prices, based on the Energy Information Administration projections do expect additional pressure on revenues throughout the year as their forecast calls for highway diesel prices to be down 26%, 20% and 12% during the remaining three quarters.","Moving to Slide 20, adjusted operating expenses declined $40 million or 10% in the quarter. Key drivers of the declines included the impacts of the peso depreciation, which contributed to $18 million of declining expense and fuel prices, which contributed another 12 million to declining expenses.","Other business drivers behind our expense trends are lower U.S. headcount, fuel efficiency, savings for maintenance contract restructuring, legal settlements and other cost saving initiatives including lower employee expenses, lower car hire due to improved cycle times in Mexico and a temporary freeze on management salary increases.","Offsetting those declines were higher depreciation expenses and washout expenses from the flooding that Jeff discussed earlier. Our estimated washout expense for the quarter is $3.9 million but we did see offsetting favorability in other casualties during the quarter.","Moving to Slide 21, compensation expense declined to $8 million, foreign exchange contributed 6 million to that decline while lower U.S. headcount contributed 4 million resulting from furloughing 12% of our U.S. workforce as Jeff discussed earlier.","Wage inflation contributed to a $3 million increase in compensation expense and while headcount is up 1% year-over-year, we did reduce headcount 1.4% from the fourth quarter to right-size our staffing to align with the volume environment we\u2019re faced with.","Moving to Slide 22, fuel expense declined 24 million primarily due to 12 million in fuel price and an $8 million impact from foreign exchange. We also saw savings in fuel efficiency and lower consumption of 2 million each.","Finally, moving to Slide 23, I\u2019d like to cover our cash flow and capital structure progress. We continue to focus first and foremost with reinvesting operating cash flows back into capital projects to capitalize on our growth opportunities.","Our CapEx guidance continues to be between 580 million and 590 million for the year, about 10% below levels in 2015. However, we continue to acknowledge the importance of balancing investing in our business with returning capital to shareholders.","Accordingly, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share paid on April 6. Additionally, we continue to execute the Board approved share repurchase program and repurchased 646,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of about $79 per share.","Cumulatively, we have completed 50% of our program and have repurchased $245 million of stock representing approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $88 per share. Finally, we will continue to purchase leased equipment and now own approximately 65% of our total equipment approximating industry averages.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments.","David L. Starling","Thanks, Mike. Just a couple of brief remarks on our very interesting quarter. We were very pleased with our overall performance and I would like to echo Pat\u2019s conviction that KCS is well positioned with a very talented and dedicated team to respond to all of the business growth opportunities we have in the coming years.","With that, I\u2019m going to open it up to questions. We have a lot of people on the list this morning, so we would like to respect everyone\u2019s time and have it down to one question please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Allison Landry","Good morning and thank you. So you guys gave some good color on how much the flooding impacted carloads during the first quarter, and Mike I think you provided what the washout expense was. But I was wondering if you could quantify how much weather impacted the top line and expenses in aggregate, and how much volume you think will be pushed into the second quarter?","Michael W. Upchurch","Allison, good question. We did disclose the 3.9 million of incremental expense during the quarter. We also had some property damage, which is capitalized which was about $8 million. But understand that it\u2019s extremely difficult for us to forecast what was lost revenue and deferred revenue and we\u2019re still working through all of those details and at this point in time aren\u2019t really in a position to disclose that. It certainly had a big impact on our quarter but we\u2019re not prepared at this point to give a specific number on revenue loss.","Allison Landry","Okay. So we should think about it in terms of the 3.9 million you called out as the expense and then the 8 million which was capitalized?","Michael W. Upchurch","Correct.","Allison Landry","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Good morning. Wanted to ask you a little bit about the volume side? I know you don\u2019t want to give specific forecast but in terms of your best read on the economy, which I know is quite difficult in your market, it sounded like you\u2019re more optimistic going into March before you got hit with the flooding. I think Pat you said something about \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s April to-date up 3%. What do you think is the way we ought to look at volumes here, your kind of best look going forward? Is it that 3% that\u2019s kind of reasonable or I think we\u2019re having difficulty parsing out the flooding impact broader for the industry and the current weak volumes versus what might be a little more optimistic run rate? Any thoughts on that would be appreciated.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Okay, I\u2019ll try to cover that but I would not extrapolate the 3% for 15 days in April. Again, there are a lot of factors; the flood which I\u2019ll echo Mike\u2019s comments. We really aren\u2019t going to quantify what we think the flood impact on the revenue and volume was. But again we also had Easter holiday occurring in first quarter of this year, it was second quarter last year. So there were other factors that contributed to the decline at the end of March. And we\u2019re going to be steadfast in our position of staying away from volume and revenue guidance just because there are a lot of unknowns out there. The timing and magnitude and potential difficulties that might occur when the auto plants ramp up, some of these other factors that we just are going to stick to our position of saying, volume and revenues are going to be whatever they are and the impact to the economy and foreign exchange, other factors are going to weigh in there and we\u2019re going to focus on things that we can control and will manage to respond to those changing circumstances as they occur. So realize that it\u2019s probably not a really satisfying answer to yours and others questions but that\u2019s really what we\u2019re going to stick with.","Tom Wadewitz","That\u2019s fine. I understand that and I appreciate the discipline not talking about markets where it\u2019s tough to tell, but in aggregate do you feel a little better about volumes or would you say \u2013 about your overall markets or would you say it feels like it\u2019s pretty weak out there and there\u2019s not much visibility?","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Again, I\u2019ll stick with what I said in my comments that we felt that things were proceeding worse than last year but better than expected. So I think that\u2019s kind of a phase that we still feel when we sort out the impact of the flood and other factors at the end of March. We do feel \u2013 I feel that things are a little bit better than we expected. But certainly for the foreseeable future there are going to worse than last year because of some of the factors that we talked about such as the auto plant shutdowns. So yes, I think we feel pretty positive about things given that our overall outlook at the beginning of the year was that 2016 was going to be down in volumes and revenues.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay, that\u2019s great. I appreciate it and nice job getting the railroad back up and running in the tough condition.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Thank you.","David L. Starling","Thanks, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes","Hi. Thanks. On the projects around the refined product imports into Mexico, what I understand you got the curveball thrown at you in terms of accelerating that timeline to April 1 and it certainly sounded like most of the participants in that business were not prepared for an April 1 kickoff. But do you anticipate seeing any of that volume materialize in the second half of 2016 given now that it\u2019s legal to move those volumes in? And then do you have feel on magnitude this year where you might start 2017 from a run rate perspective?","Brian Hancock","Hi, John. Thanks. This is Brian. I\u2019ll take that one. What I would tell you is there are a number of companies that are often working on these projects as we discussed in the comments, both the WTC\/Watco facility as well as the Rangeland facility. There are a number of other companies that are looking at that. We really don\u2019t see a lot of that occurring in 2016. If it does ramp it, it will be very slow and sporadic. We do feel comfortable that people have identified that market, identified the opportunity and we\u2019ll continue to work with each one of those but there are so many different projects and the investment is significant as you might imagine that people are kind of holding that closer to the vest. And so we\u2019ll work with them as we get the opportunity. As they develop their business case and find the right answer within that mix for Energy Reform legislation, but it\u2019s going to take a while to bring that up. So 2016 will be very sparse and sporadic. And then as the 2017 market where everybody was kind of focused, we believe there will be a potential impact and we\u2019ll make sure that we quantify that when we have the ability to do it.","John Barnes","All right. And is there any necessary investment by KSU to exploit these opportunities or is what\u2019s being done fully funded by the participant, the couple of the projects you highlighted?","David L. Starling","John, this is Dave Starling. This project is a little unique and that the landowner is the same partner that we had on the intermodal facility at San Luis Potosi. So generally one of our issues in Mexico is getting all of the land together because you got a lot of the [indiscernible] that you have to buy a lot of individual parcels and then put them altogether. In this particular case, the [indiscernible] family owns his property. They\u2019ve already done drawings. We\u2019ve already met with Watco, so we\u2019ve already got track layouts. And you\u2019ve got Watco involved who operates these kind of terminals in the U.S., so the land is secured. Watco is there with the expertise to run it and it\u2019s right on our mainline right across from our intermodal facility. So we\u2019re there to build the lead in. So it\u2019s all going to be about permitting and getting a customer. So this one \u2013 when the opportunity is there, it should move faster than if we were just going out to some greenfield site with an idea of what we would like to do. And I think he in Mexico who builds this terminal first should be a big winner because the demand is there and right now you just don\u2019t have the receiving facilities in Mexico to make that happen. So again, we don\u2019t want to throw any dates out there because we don\u2019t have them yet, but a lot of obstacles that you would generally have building something like this in Mexico are going to be easier for us to --","John Barnes","That\u2019s good to hear. That keeps reminding us about the amount of money you\u2019re spending on Sasol before any revenue shows up, so this certainly feels like a better kind of investment near term. Thanks for your time today. I appreciate it.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","I\u2019ll just add one thing here in addition to what Dave and Brian said. If you go back to Jeff\u2019s comments and his slides, he talked about San Luis Potosi and capital investment in that area. So we are looking at and kind of assessing the overall need for capacity in the San Luis area driven by the WTC\/Watco project, the Ford plant, the BMW plant and General Motors expansion. All of those things are taking place in an area of about 5 miles. So we\u2019ll probably have more detail on that as we evolve and develop our plans, but we do think that there is going to be capital required to support the growth in that region.","David L. Starling","Which is a good thing.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A question on orders. There was a news article I think last month that cited potential delays in a Kia plant opening because the government wanted to renegotiate some of the incentives. Do you have any more color on that? And is that an issue that could potentially snowball into some of the other projects as well? And also what are your current views on the auto cycle as we see it? I think some investors are concerned about potential peaking in the cycle there given the last couple of star data points haven\u2019t been great. What are you hearing from the auto EMs on that front?","Brian Hancock","This is Brian, Ravi. Thanks for the questions. Really we are working daily with Kia. We know that production will begin in May, so we\u2019re literally 30 or 45 days out from beginning production. So we believe we will start to see the business in June as we plan. I read the article that you speak of but there\u2019s been no notice on our side or from Kia and we\u2019re continuing to work daily with them to bring that business to pass and it starts in a month. So we really don\u2019t see a delay in that production. From an order perspective, I\u2019m going to let the automotive company speak for themselves on that. But we continue to see strong volumes from the company that we support in Mexico and in the U.S. and that automotive volume continues to be a key part of the process moving forward. So we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re very close to our automotive customers that each one of them has given us good projection and they feel comfortable in those projections. And the Kia plant is set to open next month and we\u2019re ready to open with them.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","And then just a couple of additional comments. As far as the Kia dispute with the government rippling into other plants, no. We think this is an isolated case and they\u2019ll work it out. As Brian said, the plant is being built and almost finished. So they\u2019re going to ship autos. And as far as the industry outlook, again you guys have resources and insights into just the general level of auto sales. We\u2019re just going to try to be as nimble as we can. We should be a little bit different than the market in general because of the plant shutdowns and ramp up we\u2019re going to be experiencing this year. But the auto industry has always been cyclical and so we\u2019re just going to be as nimble as we can and respond accordingly if it does turn down.","Ravi Shanker","Great. Just one quick follow up on the weather. Is the weather event over, because I read a news article this morning that said \u2013 spoke of record flooding in Houston. So, is it done and completely back to normal or is that an ongoing situation?","David L. Starling","Yes, this is a new and a separate event here in Houston from yesterday. We are completely restored from the prior event in early March. Right now we\u2019re still above water everywhere. This event was centralized really around Houston. We\u2019re watching our Rosenberg sub, cautiously optimistic that we won\u2019t have a problem. Certainly, we don\u2019t anticipate anything much at all, certainly not to the extent of the last impact. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re watching but right now no impact.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","You got to remember, last time that weather front in Louisiana just sat there for three days. So this one moves through, there may be another weather front behind it but you\u2019re kind of getting a break. That\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s the same one I had when I got here this morning.","Ravi Shanker","All right. Thanks for the color guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Wetherbee","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to ask a question about the competitive dynamic in Mexico both from a truck perspective but also from a rail perspective. We\u2019ve heard some anecdotes about service from competitors of yours in Mexico maybe not being quite as what it was a year or two ago. Just want to get a sense kind of how you\u2019re seeing that play out. Have there been incremental wins? And then on the truck side how the peso dynamic, obviously a weakening U.S. dollar recently probably helps you but how that\u2019s played out?","Brian Hancock","Chris, thanks. This is Brian again. I\u2019ll take that one. Certainly, we have seen additional competition from truck in certain markets primarily in the intermodal market. There is a lot of capacity out there, much the same as there is in the U.S. and it continues to have an impact on us. But we feel very comfortable. We work with our customers. We\u2019re providing a great value for them. We see this primarily in some of the shorter haul activities but in reality we believe that we have our share and we\u2019re continuing to grow that share and that\u2019s our desire and most of our plans are focused around that. When you think about our competitors, I\u2019ll let them speak for themselves but we feel like we have a great competitive product and we\u2019re going to continue to do the best we can to provide great service to our customers and we think we\u2019re winning in those markets where we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re doing those things. Regarding the \u2013 it is absolutely competitive between rail and truck. It is absolutely between rail and rail and we believe that we have great value and we\u2019re winning in certain spaces within our markets.","Chris Wetherbee","That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it. And then just a quick follow up sort of big picture taking a step back when you think about Mexico in the second half of '16 and then '17, as we\u2019ve seen some of these projects come on line and maybe some of the Energy Reform getting pulled forward. Does it seem like the opportunity in the next 18 months or so is maybe better than what you thought it might have been six months ago or nine months ago? Just trying to get a rough sense on maybe how you think about the timing dynamics and whether or not that\u2019s a little bit upside to what you originally thought?","David L. Starling","The only thing that\u2019s really changed, Chris, in terms of our view from say 90 days ago or six months ago, the timing of the Energy Reform but as Brian mentioned I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a real significant change because no one\u2019s prepared to move as quickly. The acceleration of the date came with almost no notice, so people weren\u2019t prepared to move and actually take advantage of that accelerated timeframe. We always thought that it would be here in a 2017, 2018 timeframe. But as we said that the long-term outlook continues to be very bright, new announcements. We know there\u2019s likely to be more even in the automotive space. We know that there are other people looking for plants, so we still feel very good about the longer term outlook. It\u2019s just getting through 2016 is going to be a challenge.","Chris Wetherbee","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","David L. Starling","Hi, Scott. Good morning.","Scott Group","Brian, I think you mentioned that you had some strength in export grain. Can you just put some numbers around that and give us your view on how you think export grain plays out the next few quarters just because I always think about export grain as one of the things that has a positive mix for you guys? And then just secondly, can you clarify maybe Mike if there\u2019s any opportunity given the changes with the refined products in Mexico, for you guys to be bringing U.S. fuel into Mexico and getting cheaper fuel costs for yourself?","Brian Hancock","Scott, I\u2019ll start with the grain because I would say there\u2019s strength in grain overall. We continue to have great relationships in our ag and mineral division and we continue to see strength from that. But I would tell you it\u2019s just been one of those quarters where volume has stayed fairly steady. We feel very comfortable that the service continues to improve for those customers and they have more confidence. I would also say we have significantly more cars than we had last year and that has a big impact. We\u2019re able to get at other markets where we potentially weren\u2019t able to do within the last 18 months. And so the additional cars coupled with a good, strong, steady grain market going down to some of the facilities down in Mexico has been the driver of that. So that drives kind of the 4% volume, 4% revenue gain that you saw. It\u2019s primarily cars and setting volume.","David L. Starling","And I think the one thing that\u2019s better this year, we have more cars, we\u2019ve improved cycle times so we\u2019re turning the assets quicker. And grain was probably one of the highlight areas during the quarter where we were able to keep our cross border grain trains moving in spite of the fact that our own network was out of service, because of the support and cooperation we got from our connecting carriers.","Michael W. Upchurch","Scott, this is Mike. On your question around benefiting from refined products moving into Mexico for our own fuel. As you probably remember, we do try to take advantage of cross border operations by essentially fueling up in Laredo full on southbound moves and on northbound moves trying to wait until we get across the border. So I think we\u2019ve done a pretty effective job of taking advantage of that. As the markets are opening up, we have filed for permits to bring our own fuel down into Mexico. We do expect to get approval for that fairly quickly. But also would just caution that while there might be the appearance of significantly cheaper fuel in the U.S., there are taxes being assessed by the government that effectively eliminate a lot of that arbitrage. So we\u2019ll take advantage of it where it makes sense and we\u2019ll try to maximize that benefit but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be anything significant or material at this point.","Scott Group","Can you just say net of the taxes or including the taxes what that cost savings might be per gallon right now?","Michael W. Upchurch","No, I cannot do that at this point.","Scott Group","Okay. All right, thank you guys.","David L. Starling","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Hi. Thanks, guys. Good morning. And I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s very heartening to see the railroads work together. It\u2019s been many years since I\u2019ve seen that as well, maybe since UP had their washouts in the LA Basin. Wanted to talk a little bit about headcount. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen your volumes pick up here early in 2Q. And if that trend continues, could we see you guys start calling back the furlough? I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to model this going forward.","Jeffrey M. Songer","This is Jeff. Yes, certainly we are in a good position in the U.S. with the crew, so the furlough based \u2013 as we exercised last year, you saw that volatility we were able to furlough and quickly restore crews. So we maintain that ability in the U.S. On the Mexico side, as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m comfortable with where we\u2019re at. Your year-over-year comps, because if you recall we hired and 250 was the number last year in Mexico, your year-over-year comps look a little inflated. But we\u2019re in the right position and you\u2019re seeing that in the performance metrics and as you recall the length of time it takes to hire in Mexico, we certainly want to be in a position to accommodate any of these new opportunities that Brian described.","Jason Seidl","So we should look for headcount in the U.S. to potentially go up if some of these opportunities arise?","Jeffrey M. Songer","Yes. We\u2019ll scale the headcount with volume as appropriate.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Gentlemen, thank you for your time as always.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Hi. Good morning. Great job in cutting costs and working around the floods but a question for Mike and I guess following on Jason\u2019s question there or perhaps on the operations. You scaled your furloughed employees 12% in locomotives and volumes were down 5%. Is that because you\u2019re structurally operating better and you don\u2019t need the workforce in locomotives, or is this just economic related? I want to understand if maybe on the flipside of bringing it back you can permanently cut out additional resources? And I guess Mike on that same thing you mentioned some conversion opportunities. You\u2019re now at industry average. Is there even more room to go on the equipment side?","Jeffrey M. Songer","Ken, this is Jeff. I think you hit it with the volume versus kind of the furlough and locomotive storage numbers. That variance, a lot of that do attribute to more fluid operations, the management structure, kind of the renewed focus if you will on managing the resources. So yes, I would say definitely over and above this volume decline we saw, we are achieving those benefits and reductions and those should hold for the most part. And when we refer to volume up-ticking a bit, again I think we\u2019re at a good number right now and as volume continues to grow or modify from where it\u2019s been today, I think you\u2019d see continued movement. But all-in-all, I think some of those resources have been based on the productivity improvements you\u2019ve seen.","Michael W. Upchurch","And Ken --","Ken Hoexter","Sorry, Mike.","Michael W. Upchurch","Go ahead.","Ken Hoexter","I was going to understand. So, Jeff, are they going to \u2013 again, I just want to understand. Do they permanently \u2013 do you keep reducing that structurally or do just save them in case the volumes start growing and you want to use all of that?","Jeffrey M. Songer","We\u2019ll manage both. So we\u2019ve been able to cut out I think I reference a recrew number. That\u2019s certainly efficiencies that we\u2019ve cut out because of the improvements in the car activity. Managing to volume is a delicate thing to whereas as the volume drops or rises. We\u2019re able to manage that furlough crew relatively rapidly to meet that volume demand. But I would say we\u2019re really managing both. You\u2019ve seen some good reductions that you\u2019d hold and you\u2019re seeing those numbers in the velocity, the cycle times. That just requires fewer resources and I look for those to hold and I look to continue to expand upon those opportunities.","Michael W. Upchurch","Ken, this is Mike. On your question with respect to leased assets, as you know back in 2011 we were at 18% ownership of our equipment. We\u2019re now at 65%. We own 88% of our locomotives. The remaining locomotives on lease were done in 2007 and are just not economic for us to pursue at this point. On the freight cars, we own 63% of that and there are some incremental opportunities that I\u2019d also acknowledge. We\u2019re probably in the eighth inning on that effort. And when we started this program we said we thought we had 200 to 250 basis point improvement, opportunity to reduce our equipment costs and right now we\u2019re right in the middle of that at about 225 basis points. So some opportunity left, but nothing material.","Ken Hoexter","Jeff, Mike, thanks a lot for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call.","David L. Starling","Good morning. You\u2019re welcome.","Brian Ossenbeck","Just had one question for Brian. Now that the volume structure has changed in Mexico for the refined by rail products, when do you think the pricing would move that is associated with that? Last I remember that was still fixed until I think the end of 2017 or perhaps the beginning of '18?","Brian Hancock","Brian, thanks for the question. What is going to happen is you\u2019ll start to see pricing in the LPG space in 2017 and then the refined products is the first of 2018. And we don\u2019t see any signs or anything that that\u2019s going to move forward and so we\u2019re going under the assumption that you\u2019ll have pre-pricing at those times.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And do you think that impairs the pace of investment at all? Will there be any arbitrage opportunities that appear in certain pockets of the market that might force the government\u2019s hand to loosen that restriction as well?","Brian Hancock","I\u2019m not going to speculate as to what the government will do. My assumption is I don\u2019t believe it will impair the investment. People are already very, very focused on the market. They realized the opportunity. Mexico is a growing and vibrant economy and we feel very comfortable that there\u2019s going to be plenty of investments and we\u2019ll be able to service that market as it continues to grow. So, no, we don\u2019t see that.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks for your time, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks. Good morning.","David L. Starling","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Long","So after a solid margin performance in the first quarter with year-over-year improvement in the OR and a tough volume environment, I wanted to ask if you think the long-term target for a low 60s OR is something you can achieve without volume growth? Obviously in that scenario it would take a lot longer. But I just wanted to understand if you think some of the operational or productivity improvements you\u2019re implementing could get you to that target?","Jeffrey M. Songer","This is Jeff. I\u2019m certainly proud of what we\u2019ve done this quarter and I think you\u2019re seeing some of these benefits and reduction of expenses. I think a lot of this will hold and I think you\u2019ve got again a new team in place focused on the right things. And we look to continue the focus and continue the opportunity. Do I think there\u2019s additional opportunity? Yes. Am I prepared to quantify that? No.","Patrick J. Ottensmeyer","We also feel very optimistic and certainly committed to getting to the low 60s, but as we said in the past the timing in the absence of volume growth is going to be tougher. But I\u2019ll just echo and amplify some things that Jeff said that the level of creativity and the things we\u2019re doing to improve our operational performance is very promising.","Justin Long","Okay, great. I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Good morning, everyone, and congrats on a pretty darned good quarter, especially given March.","David L. Starling","Thank you.","Brandon Oglenski","I think some of the Wall Street analysts get too negative sometimes, especially the one speaking right now.","David L. Starling","They can improve that, you know.","Brandon Oglenski","Well, let\u2019s work on that. I\u2019m going to ask a critical question, which I guess I always do, but your ROIC has come in a little bit lower as is for every railroad. But you guys kind of rank lowest amongst your big peers. Now I know you\u2019re making a lot of investments for the future. So can we talk about \u2013 and I want to come back to the earlier question about the potential for capital investments in some of these customer projects that you highlighted earlier. But how do you guys pursue these CapEx projects given that a lot of other railroads would rather see their customers invest in some of these terminals? Do you view the contracting process differently? What do you do to protect returns in the out years such that you can get the ROIC closer to your peer levels?","David L. Starling","I\u2019ll take a first stab at that and then Mike might provide some color. If we go back and I don\u2019t know if this is what you\u2019re specifically referring to, but the Sasol project, keep in mind we\u2019re investing something like 150 million, 160 million over two years; they\u2019re investing 8 billion. And this model of the support [ph] yards and that type of capital investment on the railroads part is pretty common. We have done in other cases and the other rails have done it as well. Things like the refined product projects that we\u2019ve talked about, we would be very interested in supporting those investments where we can with our own support yards. We see that as really an opportunity to help ourselves in the long run by investing in projects or co-investing that are going to drive line-haul revenue growth for years to come. What we generally have done in the past and prefer to do is we\u2019re making substantial capital investments like those. We would have revenue and commercial agreements in place that would assure us of some level of return on those investments looking at our time horizons and return thresholds. So we haven\u2019t done a lot of those type of projects on spec in the past, so we\u2019re looking for some degree of comfort and commitment that we\u2019re going to be able to get a return. I think we\u2019ll continue to look at those. And I think like Sanchez, things like the San Luis Potosi, complex projects that we talked about, those aren\u2019t necessarily tied to a single commercial or business opportunity but in those cases we would look at operational improvements and just growth in general to support the returns.","Michael W. Upchurch","Brandon, this is Mike. Just one additional comment on Sasol. We\u2019re also building a new yard there which will not only support Sasol but there are a number of other chemical customers very close to that facility that I\u2019m sure Brian will be very eager to try to win their business. But in general on the return on invested capital, we target high teens to make sure we\u2019re continuing to make incremental progress. Obviously in a down volume environment that\u2019s been a bit more challenging and the longer term nature of our assets tend to get you to eight, nine, 10 years on discounted cash flow break even. So I think all of that said, if you look over the last 10 years we\u2019ve roughly doubled our return on invested capital and this entire team on the call here is incented on return on invested capital at 75% of our performance-based stock award. So we\u2019re pretty laser focused on making sure we continue to improve that. And just over the last 18 months obviously have been a very difficult volume environment to get those incremental revenues and margin.","Brandon Oglenski","I completely understand. It\u2019s been difficult for the industry in the past year, year and a half, so appreciate the feedback on that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Thanks for the time this morning. One for Dave. You recently commissioned a big survey of both buy-side and sell-side analysts about your corporate strategy and your communication with investors. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve gotten the results by now. Can you share with us a little bit? What surprised you and what did you learn that might change the way you manage the company going forward?","David L. Starling","Actually we just got it yesterday, so we haven\u2019t digested all of the data yet. But I think a common theme that we heard, that we\u2019ve been hearing for a couple of years is don\u2019t overcommit. Tell us what you can do and tell us what you know. And then be laser focused on getting that done. And I think by us doing what we\u2019re doing today with guidance and sticking with this and while some people are saying we might be sandbagging a bit, I think it\u2019s like Joe Friday, just tell it like it is. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do and trying to give you all the facts that we have without embellishing those facts. So that\u2019s probably number one. The service problems we have in 2015 in Mexico, there were certainly some displeasure with that not only externally but also internally. So we think that we have addressed that head on and we\u2019ve got the organization in place that that would not happen again. In fact, you\u2019ll see us turn that survey out probably pretty quickly to see the reaction again. But I think it was healthy. I think it was good for us. But one thing that we really heard from the shareholders were they have a lot of faith in our growth potential. They want us to invest in our network. That was overwhelmingly the right decision versus share repurchase and stock buyback. They wanted us to reinvest in our own company, which was very encouraging. So a lot of good stuff came out of it. But a few big takeaways for us was don\u2019t have another service interruption like you did in Mexico and make sure that you\u2019re being cautious on the guidance that you\u2019re giving and don\u2019t wear rose-colored glasses. Tell it like it is.","Bascome Majors","I appreciate the color there. Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in and congratulations in a tough quarter.","David L. Starling","Thank you.","Jeff Kauffman","Most of my questions have been answered. So let me just ask this quick one. You talked a little bit about what you were doing with headcount, but you noted that 12% of your locomotives were in storage. What\u2019s the normal number and how much could you grow volume without having to make significant locomotive adds at this point?","Michael W. Upchurch","So if you recall over the last, it\u2019ll be two years now, not for six months, we added I think it was 10% to our locomotive fleet on the anticipation of the energy. So most of that is in store. Half the new locomotives what we\u2019ve been able to do is obviously store the older, more maintenance-intensive units. So you\u2019re seeing some benefit out of that. With the improved cycle times, with the improved performance, improved velocity, certainly there is room to continue to grow volume without matching that on one-for-one with locomotives or crews. So as we continue to manage the resources with the volume, I think there\u2019s opportunities to continue to outpace the resources that we might have to put back with the additional volume, but that\u2019s something we\u2019re certainly working hard and every day on.","Jeff Kauffman","In a perfect world, what percentage of your locomotive fleet is in storage?","David L. Starling","I think in a perfect \u2013 well, that\u2019d be a tough question. I\u2019d say zero. I want them all working. I want them all pulling freight. But a company our size if we\u2019ve got 50 or 75 older locomotives in storage as a surge fleet and if we got an opportunity we would be able to get those in service fairly quickly. But our high horsepower fuel conservative locomotives, we want them all operating and we really scrutinized the process when we order locomotives. We don\u2019t have a standard order every year. We justify every locomotive we order, but you do have replenishment. I mean they\u2019ll run for 30 years but you do have to replace them at some point. If you look at the numbers that we have stored compared to other railroads, we are extremely conservative.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay. Guys, congratulations and thank you.","David L. Starling","Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Starling, I would like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.","David L. Starling","Okay. Thank you for joining us on the call and we look forward to the second quarter call in July. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

And welcome to the Kansas City Southern Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2018 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company which could materially differ from the events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Ottensmeyer, you may begin.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and Happy New Year. I will start on Slide five or Slide four, I am sorry, with the presenters. And you will see one change in our line-up this quarter. Mike Naatz is going to be speaking to the sales and marketing and revenue side of the business in the presentation. We also have Jos\u00e9 Zozaya on the phone in Mexico; and Brian Hancock is here in the room with us for Q&A.","Moving to Slide five, fourth quarter results, revenue increased 5% to a record for the fourth quarter, $694 million led by strength in crude oil and refined products into Mexico. Volumes were flat from the previous year. Fourth quarter operating ratio was 63.1%, adjusted operating ratio is 64.3%. Mike Upchurch will get into details about the adjustment, but basically it relates to insurance recoveries from the Hurricane Harvey flooding in 2017. Fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.59, adjusted earnings per share of $1.56, which was a record for the fourth quarter and 13% improvement over last year.","Slide six, we are going to talk about the full year results. Revenue increased 5% from 2017 to a record $2.714 billion, 2% volume growth. Full year operating ratio reported as 63.7%. Again, the adjustment takes that to 64.3%, with the adjustment primarily being the insurance recovery that I mentioned a minute ago. Full year EPS of $6.13, adjusted to $5.97, which was also a record and a 14% increase from 2017.","Slide seven, probably the most interesting slide in the presentation today. We have finished our full year 2019 plan and long-range plan update, and keeping with our commitment that we made in November of sharing -- being a little more forthcoming with guidance, this is where we ended up when we finished our planning process.","For 2019, we are looking at volume growth in the 3% to 4% range, revenue growth of 5% to 7% for 2019 and we are putting a longer term operating ratio target out there of 60% to 61% by 2021. Jeff will talk more about that.","We mentioned -- and you saw in the press release, we mentioned a heightened focus on operational excellence and operational performance, and implementation of some of the principles of Precision Scheduled Railroading. Jeff will get into that in more detail in a few minutes.","I will just say that we are in the very early stages of our work and understanding how PSR principles will apply and we will, probably, not be completing in terms of answering some questions about timing and magnitude of some of the details. Again, we are very early in our thinking here.","So further guidance here, earnings per share over the next three years low to mid-teen compound annual growth rate and EPS. And CapEx for 2019, we are looking at the $640 million to $660 million range -- $660 million, which includes some locomotive purchases that we have talked about in previous reports. And then beyond 2019, we are looking to CapEx migrating down to something in the high-teens but below 20%.","So, with that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff.","Jeff Songer","Thanks, Pat. Good morning. Starting with review of operating metrics for the quarter on slide nine, overall dwell on velocity showed general improvement over Q3. Peak third quarter congestion eased in December and January year-to-date metrics continued to show improvement. Coming out of our normal holiday slowdown period, last week\u2019s reported dwell has returned to normal levels at 22.5 hours.","Expanding on the current state of operations on slide 10, other key metrics showing substantial improvement are the terminal performance at Monterrey and Sanchez. Inventory and dwell at these terminals have significantly improved since peak levels in the third quarter. We continue to work with customers to right-size equipment and optimize service in this region.","Cross-border initiatives continue to support fluidity in the region and Q4 was another strong quarter for cross-border volume that increased by 16%. We continue to progress our international crew initiatives and are seeing a reduction in overall transit time across the bridge as more trains operate with this crew base.","Turning to Slide 11, I will provide a quick update on capital spend. 2018 capital was 19% of revenue or 5% below guidance, reductions attributed primarily to cost savings in PTC and other capacity projects coming in below budget.","Highlights for 2019 capital include continued investment in cross-border line of road capacity and infrastructure improvements to support the growth in this region. Segments between Houston and the border, as well as Monterrey to Matamoros continue to be a priority to support cross -- strong cross-border demand and new refined products terminal coming online in Houston and Gulf regions.","Additionally, we are on track to receive the first of 50 new higher horsepower locomotives units late in January. As mentioned last quarter, we are selling 33 lower horsepower units as part of this transaction. I will provide additional color on our locomotive fleet momentarily.","Turning to slide 12, I would like to provide some insight into our plans for PSR. Entering 2019 we are focused on implementing the PSR operating principles that are most relevant to our network. To assist in this process we have entered into a consulting agreement with Sammy Fanny [ph]. Mr. Fanny is a former Canadian National Executive with 27 years of experience at CN, 12 of those years spent working as part of Hunter Harrison\u2019s Executive Management team.","In addition to his experience with CN, Mr. Fanny has done work with other railroads in similar PSR roles. He also brings a wealth of locomotive knowledge as he worked with GE for three years.","The initial areas of focus include improved labor and asset utilization, trains start rationalization and fueling efficiency among several others. Mr. Fanny\u2019s compensation structure is in line with that of our executive management team and we are all working toward shared financial goals.","Providing some real life examples of recent initiatives, we have redesigned our Intermodal and manifest product between Kansas City and St. Louis, and have reduced eight train starts per week in this segment.","Initial rationalization of our Mexico network has provided an additional 28 train start per week reduction. Combined, these two initiatives will save over $2 million per year in labor cost alone in addition to locomotive, fuel and equipment savings.","Turning back to our locomotive strategy, PSR initiatives will allow us to reduce the overall locomotive fleet. While we have not identified a total number for reduction at this time, as compared to the peak number of active locomotives in 2018, we have returned 25 leased units and are in process of [storing] [ph] an additional 20 units.","Acquisition of the 15 new units is in line with another of our PSR initiatives of reducing locomotive failures. New reliable units will allow for increased fleet utilization by reducing unplanned failures. At the same time, this acquisition provides additional high horsepower units to support the growth in our refined products unit train segment. We will continue to target other yard, local and poor performing road units for disposition.","Nothing about our networks should prevent implementing parts of PSR that will help drive efficiencies and we will continue to work closely with interchange partners who are also at work on PSR initiatives. In the end, we look to see more efficient interchanges from overall rail network improvements.","I will now turn the presentation over to Mike Naatz.","Mike Naatz","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments on page 14. You will see the fourth quarter year-over-year revenue was up 5% on flat volumes. If you were to look at the appendix, you\u2019d see full year revenue and volume growth were at 5% and 2%, respectively.","In the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong growth in cross-border carloads and revenue, most notably from refined products and cross, excuse me, cross-border Intermodal business. However, as Jeff discussed, during the first half of Q4, we were challenged by congestion in Northern Mexico and this did have an impact on our business.","During the quarter, our revenue per unit grew consistently with what we experienced in Q3, despite mixed pressure from the loss of some long-haul utility coal business and unfavorable FX. Core pricing environment remains healthy and we expect pricing to outpace inflation.","The Chemical and Petroleum business unit reported revenue growth of 19%. This growth was primarily driven by strong southbound volumes of refined products moving into Mexico. For the full year, Mexican energy reform business contributed nearly $100 million of revenue with carloads and revenue growing at 156% and 120%, respectively. We included a full year recap on this topic in the appendix. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that plastics grew at 14%.","Revenue from our Industrial and Consumer business unit was down 5% year-over-year. This decrease was primarily attributable to timing of military moves, a shift in a customer sourcing location within our metals business, which in turn significantly reduced the length of haul in those moves and then the previously mentioned congestion at the border.","Revenue in our Ag and Min business grew at 8% in the fourth quarter. This growth was driven primarily by our grain business due to improvements in cycle times and we did see positive pricing gains.","The energy unit\u2019s revenue decline of 7% was driven by a previously announced closure of a power generation facility in Texas and by continuing declines in frac sand. These declines were partially offset by higher volume and pricing in our crude oil business, driven largely by Canadian crude shipments.","Intermodal revenue increased slightly year-over-year with mixed performance by lane. The cross-border franchise revenue growth was solid at 8%, driven by truck-to-rail conversions. Other domestic lanes were challenged by congestion and tougher year-over-year comps.","Additionally, while L\u00e1zaro Intermodal volumes declined 5% year-over-year, we did see meaningful sequential improvement in this lane driven by our actions taken to restore our L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas volumes.","Revenue from the Automotive business was down slightly over the prior year. Border congestion, unplanned plant shutdowns and continued equipment availability issues in North America impacted this business unit.","And now I\u2019d like to move on to slide 15, where we provide a business segment outlook for 2019. As Pat mentioned, our full year volume outlook is approximately 3% to 4%, with a 5% to 7% year-over-year revenue growth projection.","Starting with the Chemical and Petroleum business, the Mexico energy reform continues to be a significant focus and unique opportunity for KCS. We expect volume growth from refined products to continue next year, as demand increases and storage capacity comes online. We expect Plastics to grow in 2019 with increased demand.","Additionally, heavy fuel oil shipments in Mexico are also expected to grow along with higher production. We expect to see solid performance in the Automotive business, even though certain plant closures were unexpectedly elongated following the holidays. We expect volume to grow slightly ahead of most third-party estimates for Mexico production.","In addition to increasing production to Mexico, volume growth may benefit from market share gains, easing congestion and additional equipment. We expect to see continued but moderated growth in our intermodal business at cross-border and U.S. domestic businesses started slowly, but we expect to benefit from truck-to-rail conversions, tight truck capacity and expanding capacity at some key Intermodal terminals.","As mentioned earlier, we expect to see positive sequential trends in our L\u00e1zaro business as additional trucking regulations are implemented in Mexico and as our customers continue to evaluate and take advantage of our short-term volume-based pricing strategy.","However, we are taking a pragmatic approach to the business focusing on strong service product and rational pricing. We believe that this focus will help us deliver future drive volume growth that is both sustainable and in the best interest of our customers and shareholders.","As for Energy, our coal business should grow with higher natural gas prices and increased demand in the Texas market. On the crude side of things, we are monitoring developments around mandatory production cuts by the Canadian Government and the corresponding potential implications on our Canadian crude business. Additionally, we expect continued declines in frac sand due to sourcing pattern changes.","And lastly, our outlook for Industrial and Consumer and the Ag and Min business is neutral to slightly positive, although our metals business should improve in 2019 due to capacity expansions and improved cycle times. We are watching the impact of changes to the global trading patterns and tariffs very closely.","And with that, I will turn things over to CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Let me start my remarks with a summary overview of fourth quarter 2018 results. Revenues of $694 million were up 5% primarily due to higher fuel surcharge revenues.","Reported operating ratio improved to 63.1%, predominantly due to an $8.5 million insurance recovery related to Hurricane Harvey. On an adjusted basis, excluding the positive impact from the insurance recovery, our operating ratio was 64.3% slightly worse than 2017.","Reported diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 was a $1.59 down from $5.33 in the fourth quarter of 2017, due to the one-time benefits we recorded as a result of Tax Reform. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of a $1.56 was 13% better than fourth quarter of 2017.","Our adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 28.3% and for the full year 2018, 28.9% in line with our guidance of 29%. For 2019 through 2021 we are estimating an adjusted effective tax rate of 29% to 30%, and from a cash tax standpoint we would expect 2019 to be approximately 17% and for 2020 and 2021, 23%. And you will find more details on our tax rates have been included in the appendix on page 31.","Turning to operating expenses. Operating expenses in the quarter adjusted for the insurance recovery from our Hurricane Harvey claim increased 6%. Depreciation expense increased $10 million, the result of in-servicing PTC assets and from a general increase in our asset base.","Fuel prices increased both in the U.S. and in Mexico driving up fuel expense by $10 million. Equipment costs were down $6 million, driven by lower lease payments from owning more of our equipment and lower car hire.","Purchase services were up $4 million due to slightly higher IT, joint facility, dredging and security costs. We also experienced higher personal injury costs in the quarter due to changes in estimates from an actuarial study and experienced the large derailment early in the quarter in Mexico.","Wage and benefit inflation and higher headcount of $4 million and $3 million, respectively, was partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs of $3 million. Finally FX lowered overall expense by $5 million.","I\u2019d also like to provide you a few thoughts around 2019 expense levels. First, we expect compensation and benefits to increase about 5% due to wage and benefit inflation and slightly higher headcount. But as Jeff mentioned earlier, we also expect to produce labor efficiencies based on our early PSR work. Excluding the credit for insurance settlement, continued materials and other, we would expect M&O expense and purchase services have normal inflationary type expense increases in 2019. ","We have also included estimated fuel prices for 2019 in the appendix on slide 25 and we currently believe fuel prices will moderate in the U.S., but increase in Mexico and we do expect to continue to be eligible for the fuel excise tax credit in 2019, which we estimate to be $35 million to $40 million.","We expect our equipment expenses to be down slightly, as a result of owning more of our equipment and from better cycle times. Depreciation is expected to increase approximately 9% and is inclusive of PTC depreciation headwinds of $13 million. In total, we will see PTC expense increases of approximately $17 million for the full year 2019.","Finally, let me cover some of our capital structure and capital allocation priorities. As Jeff mentioned earlier, CapEx is $512 million for 2018, did come in substantially below our original and revised third quarter guidance. We will continue to ensure capital spent in a prudent manner to support our growth. While 2019 capital will increase due to purchasing 50 new locomotives, we would expect capital expenditures to decline both in 2020 and 2021 to levels slightly below 20% of revenue.","We continue to repurchase our stock under the $800 million stock repurchase plan approved by our Board in August of 2017. In the quarter, we repurchased $80 million of our common stock, which was approximately 50% ahead of our prior quarterly pace. Cumulatively, we have now repurchased approximately $1 billion of our stock. And finally in October, S&P recognized our improvement in the capital structure and upgraded our credit rating to BBB flat.","And with that, I will turn the call back to Pat.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. I think that maybe a record in terms of finishing our formal comments. I will just make a couple of closing remarks before we open it up to questions. I will refer to the statement quote actually in the press release about the results, the quarter, the year. Obviously, not a bad quarter, not a bad year in record performance on a number of levels, but as I said in the press release, while we delivered record revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted EPS, 2018 did not meet our own expectations for financial and operational performance.","In addition, we did not meet the expectations of our customers or share owners particularly in the areas of customer service and growth. So while we feel good about performance and we know we are not altogether pleased, because we know we could have done better.","The key points I think from the presentation, I am happy to get into the Q&A, are the service recovery, particularly around the border, where we have experienced the worst congestion over the past few quarters is well underway and we feel good about the performance of the railroad as we head into the new year.","The growth opportunities, the oversized growth opportunities that we have been talking about for several of the last few quarters are real and we feel that we have got pretty good transparency on a number of those opportunities and still feel very positive about the growth outlook.","And the precision railroading initiative, I think, is off to a good start, I have been very pleased with the engagement of the team, both in the U.S. and Mexico, and with the help of Sammy, I think, we can prioritize some things that will give us pretty quick performance improvement areas and then help us deliver the kind of service that we want to on a sustained basis.","So, with that, I will open the microphone for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. The first question today is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Justin.","Justin Long","So I wanted to start with a question on the OR guidance for 2021 and I wanted to see if there was any color you could provide on the cadence of margin improvement that you are expecting over the next three years. Is it going to be a consistent pace, are more front-end loaded and then you know along those lines, how much of this improvement is a function of PSR implementation versus operating leverage in the business with volume growth?","Mike Upchurch","Yeah. Justin, this is Mike. Let me take a quick stab at that, obviously, the guidance implies somewhere around 100 to 150 basis point improvement in OR. We think we still have one major headwind going into 2019 and those are the incremental PTC expenses, which are about $17 million.","We are very early in the process here of identifying initiatives to reduce expenses. So I would probably guide you to maybe an acceleration as we get into \u201820 and \u201821, and you get the full year benefit of some of those initiatives. So hopefully that helps.","Justin Long","That does. And also wanted to ask about the headcount assumption that\u2019s embedded in that long-term guidance, I think, you said this year up slightly, but how do you expect headcount to trend in 2020 in 2021?","Mike Upchurch","Well, I think, with volume growth that we are expecting this year you know we would typically see a little bit of increase in variable headcount to move that traffic. But again, I think, Jeff mentioned it, and I made a comment on it, we would expect to continue to gain labor efficiencies. Jeff gave some pretty good examples and we are just so early in the process that we are not really fully baking in all of those potential opportunities, we will continue to do that as we move throughout the process, but expect us to try to manage headcount as judiciously as we can.","Justin Long","Okay. I will leave it at that. Thanks for the time.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning. I wanted to sort of pick up where we left off there, just sort of coming down to the EPS line, so obviously a CAGR issue in 2021. [Indiscernible] some of the things you are talking about there should we assume that maybe we are on the lower end sort of early in the process so maybe 2019 is on the lower end of that CAGR. Just wanted to get a sense of maybe how you are thinking about it as it drop down to the bottomline, because it sounds like there\u2019s some incremental expenses that need to think about for this year?","Mike Upchurch","Yeah. Chris, this is Mike again. I think that\u2019s a safe assumption. Again I\u2019d point to the step up in PTC expenses as we are now in service on our entire network. So you are going to have a little bit of a further benefit as you get into \u201820 and \u201821. So I think it\u2019s probably reasonable for you to model it that way.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess, I wanted to maybe get a sense of the CapEx profile. So elevated year in 2019 as you are bringing some new locomotive on to the network and that sort of step-down below 20%. As we are seeing PSR implemented for some of the other railroads, there\u2019s been a really meaningful draw down in capital spending as a lot of assets gets [hard] [ph]. How should we think about, is it the potential for a little bit further of a step-down or what is the dynamic that might keep you from seeing mid-teens to an upper teens on a percent of revenue for CapEx?","Jeff Songer","Yeah. This is Jeff. I will talk about that. Maybe the locomotive purchase, I think, I can explain kind of the rationale around that and promoting more high horse power units as we transition all that we will look to continue to [indiscernible] or divest some of our older yard locomotives.","I think in general other maintenance such as engineering and maintenance away, I think, those things remain pretty much in line and pretty much steady state. I think the difference probably remains to be other growth opportunities, be it capital investments in various refined products opportunities or similar that I think we are leaving ourselves some room to continue to look at how we invest and then play in that space, more from a growth capacity type scenario.","Chris Wetherbee","So, probably, won\u2019t see in that sort of mid-teens is, probably, fair to say that that might be a little bit ambitious, because of the opportunities you have around the topline.","Pat Ottensmeyer","I think that\u2019s right, Chris.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Amit Mehrotra","Excuse me, thanks. Good morning. So the company has put out long-term guidance in the past that has not been met. And even more recently, the volume expectations have not come in nearly as expected. So if you could just help us like what\u2019s different this time? You have this 2021 target there. What\u2019s different in terms of you know accountability or whether it\u2019s conservatism in the planning in terms of how you roll up to the 60 to 61 OR. I think that would just be helpful because a lot of the conversations I have, it\u2019s really some sort of long-term targets maybe met with some skepticism. So I think it would be helpful to just put some context around how you get there and what the robustness or conservatism that you baked into the plan?","Mike Upchurch","Yeah. Amit, this is Mike. I guess the prior guidance that you refer to, I think, what we predominantly missed with that guidance was the energy sector meltdown that we saw in \u201815 and \u201816 that seemed to be the source of the miss that we had.","In terms of commitment to those numbers and what we have at stake, these are all numbers that are tied to our incentive compensation plans and as you saw in some of the slides in 2018, we didn\u2019t meet those expectations, and therefore, we had lower incentive compensation. So we are -- all in on these targets and they will be tied to our incentive plans. This compensation committee of the Board of Directors will hold us accountable for.","Pat Ottensmeyer","I\u2019d just say we have completed, as I mentioned at the beginning, we have completed our 2019 budgeting process and update of our three-year plan that, as Mike mentioned, is going to be the basis of our incentive comp targets. And this plan is just based on the best information that we have available at this time, feedback from customers, as we learned in the energy situation that Mike referred to in 2014, 2015. That was also the case.","I mean, we met with our largest crude oil shippers in January of, I guess, it was 2015. Looked them in the eye and asked them are you serious about this, is this really what you are planning to move, and they said yes and we built it into our plan and built it into our guidance expectations and it proved to be wrong.","So we are always going to have risk in our plan and in the guidance, but we have sanity check this as thoroughly as we can. We have had tight dialogue with our major customers to elevate our visibility into the revenue and volume side, and so we feel that this is grounded in reality and based on the best available information that we have at this time.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. I appreciate you entertaining that question. I know it\u2019s a little bit of a tough question, but I appreciate that. One with respect to the PSR announcement, I was wondering if you could just help us think about what part of the network are you guys going to attack or address first, when Union Pacific did it, it addresses kind of mid-American network, where a lot of the frac sand was moving through and obviously volumes are going down there. Any part of the network do you may actually attack or address for us either through pilot programs or just all-in maybe what some of the volume, you can give us any color that I think would be helpful?","Jeff Songer","Yeah. This is Jeff. I try to provide a couple tangible examples of -- I would say some low hanging fruit we have already identified. I think as we look at this the Mexico network just due to the complexity or of our Intermodal manifest, you look at train length, you look at service design in Mexico, probably, more specifically related to some of these PSR opportunities and I think that\u2019s where we are really kind of setting the site is that\u2019s our priority from a service design perspective and a train start rationalization.","As we have seen and continue to work with customers in the Monterrey area as an example, we have made some good strides climbing out of the congestion here. But also taking that further and we have been able to rationalize some of the equipment directly out of that terminal working closely with those customers.","So in the area of train start, that will be our focus Intermodal\/manifest product in Mexico more strategically. The locomotive arena I have touched on. So as train starts rationalized, locomotives should follow suit and the cruise and the headcount should start following suit as well. So as we embark on in first inning here, I think, that\u2019s where we see the initial work ongoing and starting to provide the most and quickest benefit.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. And Mike is there any change in the pro forma leverage target for the company as you think about capital structure or no?","Mike Upchurch","No. Nothing that we have officially provided, as you know we are in the low 2s right now. We were very focused on getting that final upgrade to BBB flat and that occurred in the month of October and we feel pretty good about the balance sheet right now. I think it gives us a fair bit of flexibility.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. Thanks so much, guys. Best of luck in the PSR implementation. Appreciate it.","Mike Upchurch","Thank you.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Yeah. I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the PSR conversation. Can you talk a little bit about how long you have been working with the gentleman from CN Consulting arrangement and how particularly he is incentivized and what us -- desirable outcome would be over this timeframe? And just operationally around that could you just remind everyone the percentage of your business that either originates and is terminated on your network versus the carriers that you partner with to either originate or terminate shipments? Thank you.","Pat Ottensmeyer","All right. This is Pat. I will take that one and then maybe ask Jeff to chime in with a little color commentary. First of all, we are not going to get any more specific about the compensation or the arrangement that we have with Sammy other than to say that his performance objectives are very much aligned with the -- with mine. We will all of us here around the table, the executives, management team in terms of long-term performance targets.","We started working with him actually in December and he spent quite a bit of time both here in Kansas City and down in Monterey, engaging with the team fully kind of a lot of information sharing, a lot of idea generation and then we kind of formalized an arrangement here just a couple of weeks ago.","But as I said in my comments, I set in on not all of those meetings, but many of them and I think the level of engagement and then he was -- I asked him this question just yesterday, how does he feel about the engagement of the team not just the executive team, but down into the organization? And I think he\u2019s very pleased with the enthusiasm and excitement the way this has been embraced.","And let\u2019s face it, everybody in this company knows that we can do better. As I said in my comments, we had a pretty decent quarter and a pretty decent year, but none of us are very satisfied with it, because we know we can do better.","So I think the level of engagement is very high and I am very optimistic that we are going to see some very tangible -- we already have tangible things that are going to help us get better and drive toward some operational performance improvement in sustainability.","As far as your question about interchange, there is a belief out there I know some people have written that maybe PSR doesn\u2019t apply to us because of our size and because of the magnitude of our interchange. We don\u2019t believe that. But we really want to focus on the messages that we are going to adopt and implement principles of PSR that we think are most pleasurable to our network and I think there are a lot of them that do. So a lot of this is just about discipline, focus, accountability all of those kinds of things would certainly apply and we will embrace and implement those things.","But the other factor is if all of the other railroads that we interchange with are adopting and implementing certain principles their own version of this, then it makes sense that we need to be aware of and be prepared to engage with our interchange partners differently, and if the result of their effort is more consistent and reliable service to us at the point of interchange, then it kind of follows that we will benefit from the work that the other railroads are doing in this regard as well.","I also think it is important to point out and realize that the recent management change at Union Pacific, which is our largest interchange partner particularly at the border Jim, Venna and Sammy worked together side-by-side on the same executive team for a dozen years or more. So, I think, the level of coordination and communication that will have with UP as they continue to implement their own version of PSR will be enhanced.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.","Tom Wadewitz","Yeah. Great. Good morning.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Hi, Tom.","Tom Wadewitz","I know we are hitting -- I know we are hitting a lot on this topic past, so I appreciate your patience but you know this is a big topic. So, I guess, just further to the kind of role of Sammy and how you think about I guess outside resource and how important that is to your PSR initiative. I mean should we view him as essentially, he\u2019s a consultant but he\u2019s essentially full time at KSU for the next year, the next two years, maybe just a thought on that? And then you know is it helpful to bring in additional people to kind of help with the -- not necessarily at high level but just to help with culture change that typically associated with some of the PSR initiatives. So, I guess, that just some more on PSR?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I think, Sammy, will be with us you know unless something unexpected happens for two years. The incentive structure that we have put together has a two-year measurement period on it. He will not be full time. I know he\u2019s got some other commitments and other activities unrelated to us, but I don\u2019t worry that we will not have his full attention. I am pretty sure that even when he\u2019s not here, he is going to be engaged and communicating with the team and thinking about things that we -- that we are doing here.","And as far as your second question, we will just have to see if we get the kind of engagement and momentum the we are all hoping we get and sort of transfer of some of the knowledge that Sammy has from his 20 plus years of experience implementing this then we may not need additional outside resources, but we will just have to gauge that as we move along and see how the team engages.","Tom Wadewitz","That -- yeah. That\u2019s great. I guess just for the quick follow on if I can. On a multi-year OR target, can you give a quick thought on volume sensitivity to that, could you give us a volume view for 2019 and an OR target is 2021, I mean, is it -- is that a good OR target even if you hit kind of flatter volumes in out years or do you kind of need the \u201819 framework to continue in 2021 to hit the OR target and thanks for the time?","Mike Upchurch","Well, Tom, this is Mike. Obviously, volume is an important part of the equation in improving OR and as we look back on 2018, we didn\u2019t generate that volume growth. Some of it because of the shutdown of the coal facility, but other areas we just didn\u2019t deliver. And so we do have an assumption in that three-year period that we are going to see volume increase consistent with what we have always suggested we were able to do and we do have some outsized growth areas that we think will allow us to generate that kind of volume growth.","What\u2019s unknown right now is just how much cost we are able to take out over the next few years and that will become a little bit more important -- visible to us as we proceed down this path, and now I would like to thank that we get into mid-year and have some better targets around cost reductions. So you may have a couple offsetting items there but the plan definitely looks to volume growth to help deliver some of that margin improvement.","Tom Wadewitz","Okay. Thanks for the time.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matt Reustle with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Matt Reustle","Thanks for taking a question. Just a follow up on the OR target that you did provide, it\u2019s a bit lighter than what some of your peers have laid out and what some of the peers have achieved, is that just being conservative, because you are at the early stages of analysis or is there something about the network or your focus on growth that keep you from guiding to subsidiary?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I think it\u2019s a bit conservative and reflects that we are pretty early on, and perhaps, more aggressive improvements that might come out of the efforts here in the next few months. It\u2019s pretty much in line, maybe a little bit higher, but pretty much in line with our peers.","Matt Reustle","Okay. Yeah. That makes sense. And you already mentioned the U&P [ph] implementing PSR, interchange partners and planning PSR. Are you seeing any impact today, any issues with service today as they go through that process?","Jeff Songer","Yeah. This is Jeff. Now we are not really seeing any difference as of yet in service. I think again the opportunity will continue to have to work primarily with Union Pacific, which now joined kind of goals on streamlining train starts, train length initiatives. Again, I see this as a positive as opposed to a negative necessarily on any changes that other interconnecting carries may embark on them.","Matt Reustle","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Sam Allen","Hi. This is Sam Allen on for Allison Landry. Thanks for taking my question. You have spoken about working with customers to create more efficient on loading in order to improve car cycle times and fluidity. How does that fit in with the PSR implementation?","Mike Naatz","This is Mike. I will take that one. If you think about the process, you have to pick it up, you have to transport it, you have to deliver it loading and unloading is critically important. If our assets sit too long at a customer origin or destination, those assets aren\u2019t turning, if we have to wait for customers to load or unload that\u2019s going to cause a disruption in the network.","We believe that our customers will participate with us and many of them have already started to participate with us in terms of improving their loading and unloading time. It\u2019s going to work to everybody\u2019s benefit and improve service if everybody does their share of the work and does it on time.","Pat Ottensmeyer","It\u2019s just also going to result in reducing congestion at some of the yards improving the way we can operate for other customers and improving the overall velocity performance of our equipment, our locomotives, our crews, everything, so it ties in very nicely","Sam Allen","Okay. And then given that volumes came in later than expected in 2018, what gives you confidence in the 3% to 4% range","Pat Ottensmeyer","As I said earlier, just we know we could have done better than what we did in 2018, because of service and then we have talked about some of the unexpected or the impact of customer specific events like the coal customer or so.","If you set that aside you believe that our service recovery is well on its way to being fixed kind of back to normal, and then further improvement. And then feedback that we have gotten from customers and really analyzing these opportunities gives us a high degree of conviction that if we can sustain a higher level of service and operating excellence, and the customers continue to invest in the facilities that they are building. We think we have got pretty good visibility into what the volume growth outlook will be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck, J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just want to focus on volume for a second and specifically the Mexico energy reform opportunity. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s in your expectations relative to 2018? And more specifically you have seen a lot of headlines with AMLO and the administration that in fuel set of being shortages present an opportunity to actually import more across border or are you sort of constrained by the infrastructure for the time being?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yes and yes, it is an opportunity, I will tell you and Jos\u00e9 is still on the phone here. But we have had a very high level of engagement with very senior cabinet level officials in Mexico talking about developing a -- more of a longer term sustainable rail strategy for moving refined products. So we don\u2019t know exactly how that\u2019s going to play out.","But if there was infrastructure available for loading, storage, transloading, there was more infrastructure available in Mexico, we would be moving more product than we are today. So there is a opportunity and I saw just yesterday that there have been some customs changes to facilitate and streamline the movement of refined products from the U.S. into Mexico.","So we feel very good about that opportunity, don\u2019t have a good answer to your question about what\u2019s the upside, how much more could be moved, because we are literally in the middle of those conversations with -- particularly with the government as we speak. Mike, if you have anything to add to that?","Mike Naatz","I think, there\u2019s certainly some uncertainty in that space. However, we are very much engaged. I mean [inaudible] made it clear that Pemex intends to compete in the marketplace and our perspective is that KC will serve Mexico\u2019s needs whether that comes domestically or across the border.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. And then one more on the guidance of 3% to 4%, we have talked about Sasol a lot and you haven\u2019t really given anything specific, but at least it seems like it continues as there as they might be seeing some production delays, they have postponed one of their own updates. So can you give us any sort of context as to how you are thinking about that from a projection perspective in that 3% to 4% for next year? Thank you.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Well, I think, we are expecting strong growth in the plastics business unit. With respect to Sasol, yeah we are aware that the plant is mechanically completed but they are working through bringing their plants online and we are not expecting to receive any material shipments from them until late in the year and we don\u2019t expect that they will ramp up to full production, probably, until 2020. But we really can\u2019t speak for Sasol, those are questions that are best answered by them, but that is what we are considering in our plan.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.","Ken Hoexter","Hey. Good morning. I know you have run on for a bit here, but I just want to say, Sammy, great hire or addition to the team, even if as a consultant. But maybe Pat, just a little bit more on that. When you say certain principles, can you describe what is relevant to your network and maybe what\u2019s not? I just want to understand when you say you are going to adapt certain parts of it, what should we expect?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I think some of the examples that Jeff gave earlier. I will ask Jeff to provide some more color commentary on that.","Jeff Songer","Yeah. Certainly for me -- we have got to get a more consistent service product. I think we performed well, we saw last year, we didn\u2019t perform, as well as we had historically or liked to. So consistency is probably one of one of our keys and in doing so again, train start rationalization, simplifying networks, total train starts, again, working with customers on right-sizing equipment, taking some excess equipment off the system, all will allow us to kind of flow better and for me consistency is really what we are -- what we need to achieve here most.","Other areas we are touching on a lot, I just mentioned a few. Fueling, it\u2019s interesting to see we have processes for fueling and I will give one more detailed example of locomotive shutdown process.","We have technology that shuts down locomotives automatically, we have manual processes and just the experience or viewpoints from Sammy or from Hunter via PSR on things like that is that we do save some money on how we shut down locomotives. However, we probably increase our locomotive failures upon startup. So making decisions based on more experience and kind of what Hunter\u2019s methodology has been throughout his career may shift us one way or the other on technologies or pieces such as that fueling.","I mentioned locomotive fleet, how we are going to look at that, how we are going to right-size and have opportunities to look at locomotives and kind of rightsizing locomotive fleets, equipment is another big one.","So I think really what you are hearing from other PSR implementations, again, I look across these segments and I don\u2019t see any of those that aren\u2019t really kind of applicable to our network in some form or fashion.","Again, I think, we do talk about the interchange as part of that, then we are different in terms of interchange, but again the shared goals that we have to create more efficient interchange wherever it may be to use them certainly at the border, working with interchange partners better to improve fluidity there as it is in everybody\u2019s mutual interest.","I think one of the things I am excited about is to see from a Union Pacific perspective with PSR kind of streamlining efficiencies to use them, we know that that\u2019s -- for an industry, that\u2019s important -- that\u2019s an segment and an important geographical region for the rail industry that is we can streamline and simplify operations collectively through areas like that, I think, we all will benefit.","Mike Naatz","Ken, this is Mike. Maybe just one other quick thought and Jeff kind of alluded to that earlier and Pat may have made a comment. But there\u2019s been a lot written or said about do these principles apply to KCS because of our smaller network, and obviously, we are interchanging a lot of traffic with UP, but Mexico looks and feels a lot more like the other rails with originating and terminations on our own network there. So I think that gives us some additional confidence that we can gain a lot of leverage there.","Ken Hoexter","I appreciate that. I don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s ever questioned whether it would work I think and to prove that it is his first stop at ICC. But I guess I want to understand, Pat, do you view this I mean with Sammy as a part time consultant I was a bit surprised by that. I mean I think it would be a great addition to the team, but as Tom mentioned before, you typically see PSR is kind of a complete overhaul culture change. So do you see this more as a mechanical adoption, and kind of as Jeff you were mentioning, kind of doing piece parts versus a complete overhaul of culture change, slashing employees, cutting CapEx, changing how customers behave? I just want to understand is this incremental or is this kind of usually a PSR is kind of a shock to the systems completely changed fundamentally how you operate?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I think it\u2019s a bit more incremental in our case. And I just remind people that we are not coming -- going back to the hunter\u2019s experiences. We are not coming from kind of the distance to the pack in terms of operating ratio and performance. And I think if I will even remind everyone thinking the one of the conference calls that the Hunter had when he was at Canadian Pacific talking about his desire to acquire, I think this might have been Norfolk Southern.","But the question was raised what about if it doesn\u2019t work out, would you pivot to Kansas City and one of the comments he made was well they run a pretty good railroad there. So I don\u2019t know that the magnitude of the change that we see is such that kind of as you refer to a culture shock is necessary or appropriate.","We have done a lot of work here internally with our employee base in U.S. and Mexico over the last couple of years about culture, principles, values, accountabilities, I think, all of this fits in with the work that we have done there. So I think it\u2019s much more of an incremental.","We will do this in a manner that is consistent with the culture and values that we have been talking about with our employees for really the last couple of years and so I think it is going to be a bit more incremental, which doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t be pretty powerful in terms of the magnitude of the impact.","And at the core, as Jeff mentioned, at the core of all of this is focused on service, serving our customers, yes, we will probably have some change management to do with customers as certain elements of this rolled out, but getting our service to a level that is consistent, sustainable and allows us to realize the growth opportunities that we know are out there of course.","Ken Hoexter","I appreciate all of that. Thank you. Just a quick one if I can sneak one in the autos you mentioned a positive outlook, but it\u2019s started off pretty negative. Is that significant closings or overhauls to start or anything just a quick one on the auto thing?","Mike Upchurch","Sure. This is Mike. The number of the automotive manufacturers in Mexico are going through plant shutdowns throughout the holiday. We got off to a slow start two of those plants ended up taking a week longer to start up and we had expected and planned for that\u2019s why we started a little bit soft. We are seeing a recovery now as those plants come back online.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Thanks for the time guys. Appreciate it.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you, Operator. Good morning, gentlemen.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning.","Jason Seidl","Looking at \u201819 in terms of your OR outlook, how much of your conservatism and it takes the fact that two of your major interchange partners are implementing PSR, and that reminds you that in some blowback on operations because of that?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Well, we haven\u2019t seen that. So, I don\u2019t know...","Jason Seidl","Knocking on the wood when you heard that.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Sorry.","Jason Seidl","I said that was me knocking on the wood when you said that.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yeah. Yeah.","Jeff Songer","Yeah. This is Jeff again. I mentioned earlier, we haven\u2019t seen any material change either way with major interchange partners. And I think again that the relationships that that we have with you UP remain strong. I think Sammy and his experience with Mr. Venna [ph] also are going to help support that.","And again as we have talked it\u2019s in our mutual best interest to run a more fluid network and that depends on both kind of both sides or both partners whatever interchange partner we are working with really looking at that and working together better on how we can streamline, streamline flows. If we are able to reduce train starts, great longer trains do just in complex that\u2019s going to create better fluidity and help the overall network.","Jason Seidl","Okay. All right. That\u2019s understandable. I want to switch to my next follow-up questions to L\u00e1zaro. You talked about your activities were spread down and I know that came around sort of get back to some of the shippers, because the exchange rate was making a very unfavorable versus sort of the local shippers down there. Can you talk about those givebacks and the impacts on the reported pricing numbers and how that maybe would look Exa?","Mike Upchurch","Sure. I am happy to talk about that a bit. So we do have a rebate program in place targeted to grow traffic out of L\u00e1zaro into Mexico City. The concept\u2019s relatively simple. If the shippers hit their growth rates, then the rebate is applied accordingly.","That rebate basically neutralizes the effect of some of the costing issues that we have that make us less competitive. These rebates are basically in operation, while the exchange rates are greater than 17 pesos per U.S. dollar. So they do fluctuate depending on the value of the peso. And if they don\u2019t hit their growth rates, then no rebate is paid out. So we believe that it\u2019s making us competitive in the marketplace.","Jason Seidl","And so what sort of an impact -- what sort of an impact did that have on reported pricing?","Mike Upchurch","It was very immaterial.","Jason Seidl","Okay. That clears it up. Gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Scott Group","Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Group","So are you guys implementing any of the asset story all demurrage changes in intermodal lane closures like we have seen from the S&P this year?","Mike Upchurch","Yes. We are evaluating the rates that we provide or that we charge for services that we provide. So the answer is, yes.","Pat Ottensmeyer","We are evaluating at this stage. As far as intermodal enclosures, no, we haven\u2019t considered any of those.","Mike Upchurch","Scott, I think as we look at again our largest or kick off really opportunity for PSR\u2019s, as I mentioned intermodal manifest. It\u2019s more of probably consolidation of trains and if we look at train length and our ability to more merge or combine those types of traffic to reduce train starts as opposed to rationalizing an entire intermodal lanes as an example.","Mike Naatz","And remember, Scott, our intermodal business is kind of in discrete categories. U.S. on the Meridian Speedway where we are a bridge carrier, we have our cross-border network and then Lazarro. So they are probably are a huge opportunity to go walk away from segments of that business.","Scott Group","Right. It makes sense. Okay. And then, I want to just make sure I am understanding sort of the message on this PSR path. So as we have seen the other models play out, right, meaningful sort of 20% plus reductions or improvements in labor productivity meaningfully lower CapEx and locos in step functions in OR, CSX, CP 1,000 basis points in two years, right. I get the message, right, it\u2019s early and we are not really sure exactly about. Are these sorts of things in your mind in the realm of possibility or is it that, hey, our starting point much better, we are doing little bit differently and don\u2019t get too carried away. I just want to make sure I am really understanding the message?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I would say you -- your final comment there. We are starting from a different perspective than some of the other examples out there. So we don\u2019t feel that the magnitude of that sort of initial pop is going to be the same in our case as it was at couple of the other railroads.","Scott Group","And I know you have shied from this maybe a little bit, but are you willing to say where the U.S. is because I did, I thought like historically that was closer to the 70 than low 60. So I would thought there would be a big opportunity there?","Mike Naatz","Scott, this is Mike. We are -- we are not going to go there. We have continued to make improvements in the U.S. and we will continue to make improve -- improvements going forward, but we are going to stick to our consolidated business, our bread and butters, the cross-border and it takes both sides of the U.S. and Mexico to generate the kind of profitability that we are.","Scott Group","Okay. It makes sense. Thanks so much, guys.","Pat Ottensmeyer","That is truly how we manage the network.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question this morning is from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Please proceed with your question.","Fadi Chamoun","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a couple of clarification, is there anything in the labor agreements in Mexico that might make the application of PSR like we have seen it elsewhere more difficult?","And the second question is just really clarification on your slide 15 I think over that volume outlook slide. You say there is a risk to the crude outlook, the heavy crude outlook in 2019 due to Canadian crude production cuts. I was under the impression that these agreements were take or pay with volume commitment. Is that not the case?","Mike Upchurch","Yes.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yeah. But it\u2019s not -- the agreements provide compensation, if there -- if the volume commitments or targets are not met, but they don\u2019t have to ship the product, so you could have an impact on our volumes but there is a mechanism to recoup particularly the capital investment that we have made to support that business.","Mike Upchurch","That means said another way that per car charge that we will get for not moving the volume is less than the margin we would have received on the carload that would have moved full.","Jeff Songer","I will take the initial question on the labor. Now that the outlook in Mexico really doesn\u2019t prevent us from gaining efficiencies through labor productivity, we will probably go at it a little bit differently. We still have -- as we have talked about three and four-person crews in the cab in some areas, so you might see target or you might see one-time restructuring activities as we negotiate with labor to try to maybe gain efficiencies in those areas, as opposed to the other aforementioned activities on train start rationalizations. But there\u2019s really nothing structurally different that would prevent us from right-sizing labor forces.","Fadi Chamoun","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time I will turn the floor to Mr. Ottensmeyer for closing comments.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you all very much for your time and attention. We will be active here in the next few weeks on the conference circuit and plan to provide updates, and probably, more details as we get further into this. So stay tuned to that. And I think the only thing I can think of to say is we close out is go chief. We will see you all in about 90 days. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"12349":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q2 2015 Results Earnings Conference Call July 17, 2015  8:45 AM ET","Executives","Dave Starling - CEO","Pat Ottensmeye - President","Jeff Songer - SVP, Engineering and Chief Transportation Officer","Mike Upchurch - EVP & CFO","Jose Zozaya - President","Analysts","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Jason Seidl - Cowen & Company","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Matt Troy - Nomura Securities","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Brian Ossenbeck - JPMorgan","Justin Long - Stephens","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Tyler Franz - Raymond James","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Cleo Zagrean - Macquarie","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets","Operator","Greetings, and welcome to the Kansas City Southern Second Quarter Earnings Call.","At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company, which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, filed with the SEC.","The company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Starling, Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern. Mr. Starling, you may begin.","Dave Starling","Thank you and good morning, and welcome to Kansas City Sothern's second quarter earnings conference call.","With me presenting this morning are Pat Ottensmeye, our President, who will review the performance of our business units and give some market commentary. Jeff Songer, will provide an update on our operations and Mike Upchurch will discuss some of our key financial metrics as well as talk a bit about our capital structure and capital priorities and Jose Zozaya will be answering questions from Mexico on any business climate or regulatory issues.","Our second quarter overview, I'll begin by saying that while KCS reported revenues declined 10% year-over-year, the actual percentage declined due to decreased car loadings was 2%. In other words, foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices were responsible for 8% of the total 10% decline.","KCS' adjusted operating ratio came in at 68.1%, which was 1.1 point higher than last year's adjusted OR. Keeping their overall margins in the 32% range, while experiencing a 6% decrease in the car-loadings speaks of the strength of our franchise and our ability to take corrective actions.","I\u2019ll let Jeff, Pat and Mike provide some color on the past quarter, but I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes focusing on the second half of 2015 and beyond. While there is still a great deal of uncertainty in many of the end markets we serve, we've seen our daily car-loading volumes increase each over the past two months.","We\u2019re seeing some tangible signs of life in our energy business and after a mild spring, it\u2019s hot in the Midwest and South particularly Texas and hot is good for our coal franchise.","While some of the coal fired utilities we serve will continue to be challenged by low nat gas prices, they\u2019ve began to receive more coal. We\u2019ve added train sets and returns from hurdle train crews on the U.S. side.","Moving to another area of our energy group, the spread between the Western Cape Canadian Select and mine and crude index has widened over the past month and as a result, we\u2019re starting to see a steady increase in crude moving over our Kansas City gateway to the Gulf.","July should be a record for us in terms of crude car-loadings and if the projection of our crude receivers holds up, which is always a big F in a volatile market, August should be better than July and September should be better than August.","Can we be 100% sure this trend will continue? No. It\u2019s always very possible that spreads will again contract. What one real positive is the volume of Canadian and heavy crude going to pay at 3 serving the Gulf it has been steadily increasing and the pipeline capacity to that area is pretty much tapped out.","That would suggest that incremental barrels going from Canada to the Gulf refiners will be coming by rail. In addition, after months of contraction the Baker Hughes rig count has stabilized and actually has risen modestly and I repeat modestly over the last three weeks.","By no means is the story combined to energy. Our chemical and petroleum business is off to a nice start in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to be bolstered in part by additional business with MX in Mexico.","In terms of our Ag business, while the hardest is still a few months away, given the expectation of a good crop along with the record inventories and storage and steady demand in our service area, KCS's grain business looks solid in the third and fourth quarter.","On the service side, we continue to right size our resources both in the U.S. and Mexico. We\u2019re hiring crews in Mexico and are steadily placing them in service and Jeff will get into more detail on our service recovery plan in a few moments. But I\u2019m increasingly more confident that we\u2019re beginning to see sustainable improvements in our key service areas.","During the second quarter we announced a share repurchase program of up to $500 million. We began to execute against this program. Mike, will provide you more detail, but I believe our long-term growth opportunities are quite good and coupled with our cash flows and strong balance sheet I agree purchasing our share is a good decision.","I\u2019ll have some comments at the close, but I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Songer","Thank you, Dave and good morning.","Beginning with Slide 7, operational highlights for the quarter focus on recent improving trends in Mexico, while full second quarter metrics lagged prior year numbers, trends over the past few weeks are showing improvement, particularly in dwell and Cars online.","Dwell time in the major terminals in the North zone in border region has stabilized and we\u2019re showing improvement in the South zone as hiring efforts are taking effect. Central Mexico metrics have not fully rebounded as hiring processes lag that of other areas. As I\u2019ll detail below, we\u2019re in position to fill our hiring needs through the third quarter.","Mexico car zone line number has steadily decreased over the past few weeks and we\u2019ve seen a 10% reduction through early July versus May. This signals the network is becoming less congested and in turn should drive improvements in velocity in dwell.","Turning to Slide 8, I wanted to provide an update on the progress that has been made with Mexico T&E workforce. To-date we have 25% of the required 215 new employees hired and in service. Another 50% have been hired and are currently in training. These trainees will be in service in August.","The remaining 25% are in the hiring process and will provide for extra Board capacity and maintain staffing levels going forward.","Regarding Mexico Labor Organization, we have made positive strides over the past several weeks. In early July our Management Team was able to negotiate several longstanding items that will help drive productivity. Specifically we will expand the use of distributed power, which will support longer trains.","We will increase our maximum allowable train length from 7,200 feet to 9,000 feet and our maximum number of locomotives per train from five to seven. Additionally, we will expand our yard limits in some areas to improve crude flexibility in and out of terminals.","These operational restrictions have always been part of the collective agreement. An easing of these will provide for operational efficiencies and signal strides in our relationship with the union.","In the U.S., the increased synergy in grain demand outlook for the second half of the year has led us to recall some carload crews. Carload numbers for the second quarter peaked at 8% of the workforce and for load status. We currently stand at 6%.","Additionally, we have brought some locomotives out of storage and have approximately 8% of the fleet in storage versus the peak of 12% in the second quarter. We will continue to balance resources to control cost yet maximize volumes.","Touching on our main capacity initiatives, our extension of Sanchez Yard is progressing slightly ahead of schedule. We expect to open initial tracks in Q3 with the 2015 project completed in December.","Work at Sanchez will continue in 2016 and we will likely jumpstart the 2016 program and begin grading for new classification tracks in late 2015. This project will help to enhance our cross-border fluidity.","Lastly, in August, the new railroad bridge crossing between Matamoros and Brownsville will open. While this bridge replaces the existing bridge located in the center of downtown Matamoros, the new location and new support facilities will provide for greater operational efficiencies at this crossing.","We're also using this bridge in conjunction with the union specific and customs agencies to help streamline railroad broad crossing process. We will look to acquire these new processes at our Laredo international bridge for future efficiencies there.","I will now turn the presentation over to our President, Pat Ottensmeye.","Pat Ottensmeye","Thanks Jeff and good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 10.","As Dave mentioned earlier second quarter revenues were $585.8 million or 10% lower than last year, volumes fell by 6% from last year.","I want to highlight a few of the main drivers behind our revenue performance for the quarter. The 10% revenue decline equates to about $64 million lower revenue compared to last year. $31 million of that reduction is attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue with the more majority of that due to declining U.S. diesel and WTI prices. About $18 million of the decline is attributable to the impact of a weaker Mexican Peso.","There you can see the vast majority of our revenue decline is attributable to factors that do not accurately reflect the condition of our core business. All of this would then suggest that the revenue decline attributable to core business weakness was about 2% overall.","As Slide 10 illustrates, more than all of that core revenue decline was due to weakness in our energy business unit specifically utility coal and frac sand where we saw line haul revenues fall by $31 million combined from last year.","Other areas of the weakness include our industrial and consumer business, which was primarily driven by lower metals and scrap shipments due to reduced demand for drilling pipe and continued high levels of the import due to the strong U.S. dollar.","In addition, our Ag and minerals business declined from last year due to a combination of factors including strong cons in 2014 and service related issues, which adversely impacted shipments during the quarter particularly in our cross-border grain business.","On the positive side, chemicals and plastics revenue increased by 1% in spite of a 2% reduction in volume due primarily to pricing gains and favorable mix in this business.","While our Intermodal and Automotive business units showed lower results during the quarter, we feel that most of this decline was attributable to service and equipment issues, some of which Jeff covered a few minutes ago and not a reflection of the core demand or opportunity in this business going forward.","And finally and perhaps most importantly, pricing continues to be strong trending up across our entire portfolio. Both same-store sales and contract renewals increased solidly in the mid single digit range and both registered sequential increases from the prior quarter.","You can see in the upper right hand corner of Slide 10 that mix and pricing had a positive impact on revenue per unit but not enough to offset the headwinds caused by fuel and foreign exchange.","Moving on to Slide 11, here we summarize the impact of the major drivers of revenue performance, an attempt to illustrate the points I made earlier which is that our reported results for the quarter do not accurately reflect the condition of our core business or the demand that we feel currently exist across our broader portfolio.","This point would be amplified if we were to add the impact of weaker than expected service performance particularly in Mexico. We\u2019re not going to provide estimates regarding the impact. Those services you had on revenues and car loads, but we absolutely know there was demand during the quarter that we could not satisfy due to our inability to meet customer service requirements.","This was due across many commodity areas, but particularly evident in cross-border grain, intermodal and automotive.","As Jeff explained earlier, we\u2019re addressing these factors that caused our service deterioration and we are getting better every day. Most importantly, we do not believe we have suffered any permanent long-term loss of business and we believe that business will return as we continue to improve our service.","On Slide 12 you can see that belief in the outlook illustrated on this chart where we show the outlook for the rest of the year. This slide shows our current expectation for second half of 2015 compared to the first half.","We\u2019re showing you this sequential view because we think it provides a better sense of the momentum of our business as we head into the back half of the year. The key driver shown on this slide are pretty self explanatory, so I\u2019m not going to spend time on each commodity group, but we'll focus on the important theme as we think about expectations for the rest of the year.","Service improvement will drive our ability to meet customer expectations and core demand, especially in cross border grain, intermodal and automotive.","Continued strength in crude oil shipments will be driven by the opening of terminals opened over the last six months on our network. By the way, we're actually seeing this materialize so far in the third quarter, our crude-by-rail volumes are about 70% above last year and about 65% above the first quarter 2015 levels.","As Dave mentioned the Maya and WCS spread is back in the double-digit range and our key customers are telling us that they expect to continue shipping Canadian crude to the U.S. Gulf.","And finally our utility coal business will improve primarily because it simply can\u2019t get any worse than it was in the first half of the year.","In the interest of full disclosure, if we were to show you the Slide based on comps to the second half of 2014, the splits would be 34% favorable, 41% neutral and 25% unfavorable with the major difference being utility coal, which would move from favorable to unfavorable due to the extremely easy comps in the first half.","On the next few slides I want to touch briefly on some significant announcements that we've made since our last earnings call in April. First on July 9, we began operations at our new Wylie Intermodal Terminal outside of Dallas.","We covered some of the important features and benefits of this terminal on Slide 13. The punch line here is that we expect this new state-of-the-art intermodal facility will provide a platform for growth in our key Meridian Speedway routes between Dallas and the Southeast and Mid Atlantic markets for many years to come.","You can see by the graph on the slide that we had exceeded the theoretical and sustainable capacity at our existing Zaca junction terminal in Dallas. Completion of the first phase at Wylie will increase lift capacity by about 50% to 40% increase in parking slots.","In addition to the expanded footprint, the expected improvements in operational efficiency will further increase capacity at this terminal. As you can see from the aerial view, the photograph on this slide, there is plenty of room around this Phase I for further expansion if the business continues to grow in these markets and we believe it will.","Second on June 8, we announced an agreement with Sasol Chemicals for the construction and long-term lease of the storage in transit yard to support Sasol's $8.1 billion ethylene cracker and derivatives plant in Lake Charles, Louisianan. Slide 14 provides a brief chronology and summary of this agreement.","We believe this agreement will be very positive, strategic development for KCS by not only serving Sasol's needs for many years to come, but improving our ability to serve the growing petrochemical industry and other customers in the Lake Charles and mid Gulf markets.","At this time, we're not going to provide any specific revenue and volume guidance related to this agreement, but you can see on Slide 14 that we do expect this to have a noticeable impact on our capital spending for each of the next two years in the order to 2% to 3% of revenues per year.","Finally, I\u2019m very pleased to draw your attention to a press release from two days ago where we announced the appointment of Brian Hancock to the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer.","We first become acquainted with Brian when he was Vice President for Global Supply Chain at Whirlpool Corporation a few years ago. In that role, Brian led the development of a worldwide logistic strategy for Whirlpool\u2019s growing Mexican manufacturing operations.","Brian has also held leadership positions at Schneider National, Martin Brower, which is the largest distributor of food and materials from McDonald\u2019s restaurants worldwide and most recently Family Dollar Stores.","In addition to his impressive credentials as a logistics and supply thought leader, he understands rail and specifically KCS, he understands operating in Mexico and he understands how KCS cross-border rail network can add value to high performing supply chain strategies.","He brings a very interesting customer perspective as we continue to elevate our position as a strategic supply partner with our key customers and channel partners. We welcome Brian to our Executive Management team and look forward to the contributions to our future growth and success.","So finally to summarize all of this from a revenue and volume perspectives, core business demand field stronger to us than our second quarter results would indicate. We expect the momentum in some of our key business units to get stronger as we move into the second half of the year.","The pricing environment continues to be strong and is actually gaining momentum. Our service performance is improving and we're confident that that will continue and finally the long term growth outlook for KCS continues to be very positive.","With that, I will turn the presentation over to Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Pat, and good morning everyone.","I\u2019m going to start my comments on Slide 16. A quick summary of the quarter -- second quarter volumes did decline 6% and revenue 10%. As Pat has already discussed declining fuel prices and the negative impact of the peso were the main drivers behind our declining revenue.","Adjusted operating ratio increased 1.1 points to 68.1, while expenses declined 8%, it was not enough to offset the 10% decline in revenue and I\u2019ll cover some specific expense details on the next slide.","During the quarter, we again saw limited impact to operating income from foreign currency as our peso denominated revenues and expenses currently offset each other. We\u2019ve included information on Slide 28, in the appendix for your information.","We continue to hedge our foreign exchange risk in income taxes and it's illustrated on Slide 30 in the appendix, the net impact of the hedge and related tax benefits were positive $1 million for the quarter.","Finally, reported EPS was $1.01 per share while EPS adjusted for FX impacts was $1.03 per share.","Moving to Slide 17, operating expenses declined 8%, aided by an $18 million reduction due to foreign exchange and a $15 million U.S. fuel price reduction.","Excluding those items, expense would have declined 1%. Other key drivers of expense decline include $10 million from fuel consumption and efficiency, lower incentive compensation expense of $6 million and $2 million in savings from contract restructuring actions.","Offsetting those declines were $5 million in increase from wage inflation and $6 million in higher depreciation charges.","Moving to a sequential view quickly; cost declined $16 million led by lower incentives, reduced casualties, lower fuel expense, lower headcount, reduced employees expenses and lower locomotive maintenance costs.","Let me cover each of the major expense categories on the left side of the slide and for your benefit, we've included more details for the key expense components in the appendix.","Compensation expense declined $8 million or 7%. Declines from foreign exchange and lower incentive compensation were partially offset by an increase from wage inflation and higher headcount. Average employee headcount increased 3% in the quarter, bur declined slightly on a sequential basis.","Moving to purchased services, we saw a $7 million decline or 11%. Key drivers in the quarter were foreign exchange and equipment maintenance contract that was restructured and lower legal and consulting expenses.","Fuel expense declined $30 million or 28% and we provided details of the cost per gallon by country in the appendix. Lower volumes contributed another $7 million to fuel expense and finally we experienced a $3 million decline in fuel as a result of better efficiency from less gross ton miles related to carload declines, storage less efficient locomotive and improvements in our idle time programs.","Equipment costs were flat year-over-year aided by $2 million in lower lease costs from our lease equipment acquisition program, which was offset by a $2 million increase in car hirer due to network performance issues in Mexico.","The net lease benefit in the quarter was $1 million as higher depreciation from lease conversions was approximately a $1 million. The remainder of the depreciation expense increases due to our higher capital base and materials and other expenses were flat on a year-over-year basis.","Moving to Slide 18, as announced in May, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million stock buyback program expiring June 30, 2017. The opportunistic repurchase program will be funded with currently available liquidity and financing and reflects the company's belief in the strength of the franchise and our future growth prospects.","Our current expectation is we will execute the program over the two year period that's been authorized by our Board of Directors. Our intent as we've communicated before is to remain an investment grade company and balance the interest of our shareholders and debt holders.","We engaged in discussions with the rating agencies and understand our borrowing capacity, which is sufficient to execute this program by returning a meaningful amount of capital to our shareholders, while at the same time, maintaining a prudent investment grade credit profile that we believe is both appropriate and necessary to reliably and cost effectively fund our future growth capital requirements.","Moving to Slide 19, let me address our capital allocation strategy that we believe we\u2019ve thoughtfully evaluated over a number of years and adjusted as needed for our change in capital structure and business conditions.","After years of being constrained by limited financial flexibility as a non-investment grade company in a highly capital intensive business and living through the challenging credit market in 2008 and 2009 with a balance sheet that put severe strain on our ability to fund necessary capital in refinanced near term maturities we began to repair the balance sheet by retiring debt and ultimately achieving investment grade status. Something we believe is extremely important in light of our high capital requirements and the long term nature of our assets.","Once we completed the de-levering and achieved investment grade status, our focus appropriately shifted to balancing the needs of investing in our business and beginning a thoughtful strategy of returning cash to our shareholders.","As we discussed on the first quarter call, in light of reduced volumes, we did reduce our capital spend for 2015 by $50 million to $70 million, which was primarily growth in capacity expansion capital.","We currently expect to spend between $650 million and $670 million during the course of 2015. Roughly 30% of our projected capital spend relates to rolling stock that we ordered in 2014 that is being delivered in the current year.","We strongly believe staying ahead of our future growth by purchasing equipment and investing in necessary capacity expansion is the most prudent strategy to ensure we meet our customer needs and stay ahead of expected growth.","With respect to shareholder returns, we did repurchase 222,000 shares from our common stock in the second quarter at a cost of $20.6 million or an average of $92.71 a share. Our Board of Directors also declared a second quarter dividend of $0.33 per share.","Since we initiated dividend back in 2012, we've increased our dividend by 69% and coupled with our share buyback program believe we\u2019re executing a balanced capital allocation plan that reinvest our cash flow back into the business, returns a reasonable amount of cash to our shareholders and maintaining a strong credit profile that will position us extremely well for many years in the future.","Finally, we continue to evaluate the purchase of leased equipment and have identified additional equipment to convert ownership through 2017, which will continue to improve our OR and earnings.","At this point, we see a path to owning approximately 65% of our equipment, which would represent substantial improvement over a starting point of less than 20% back in 2011.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Dave Starling.","Dave Starling","Thanks Mike.","So in closing just a couple of remarks a little about the past and where we are today. When I became the President in 2008 just in times we experienced first time one of the worst recessions in our history. Our operating ratio was 82 in 2009.","So as we came out of the recession, we focused on rebuilding our physical network and controlling our cost. Our margins have steadily improved and from 2000 to 2014, we improved our operating ratio by an average of nearly 200 basis points per year.","This team is very capable with continuing to control our cost and support our long-term growth plan over the coming years and we continue to maintain our low 60 operating ratio target by 2017.","And we've had a few disappointing quarters, but with a little help from the economy, we believe the future is very bright for KCS and for the rail industry.","And with that I\u2019m going to open it up for questions. We\u2019ve tried to make our deck smaller. We've listened to you. We get a lot of criticism for going too long. So we try to shorten our deck and we\u2019re going to ask everyone to ask one question and we\u2019ll try to wrap this call up within an hour if we can today, but with that we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Greene","Hi good morning.","Dave Starling","Good morning, Bill.","Bill Greene","Dave, we used to always ask and talk about what inning are we in on the labor productivity front and what not. And given some of the challenges that we've had now and when we look at the plans to hire particularly in Mexico, can you talk a little bit about what you think is left if anything there? Obviously we're hiring but volumes are down.","So is this a pause and we will have a new level of productivity that will come in once we get some of the union stuff going and humming there, or how do you think about where you are in that?","Because to get to a low 60s OR, it would seem you need the revenue growth for sure because unless that changes, the cost side is slowing I think. Just talk through your thoughts there would be helpful, thank you.","Dave Starling","Well Bill, I\u2019ll open it up and pass it to Jeff. What we've got in Mexico now is a bit of a breakthrough. We\u2019ve been working on this for some time and we had very good dialogue with the Union. Jeff has a different relationship with the Union then his predecessor. It\u2019s very positive.","Jeff joined the key Manager in Mexico joined the Union and ahead of the Union is very powerful guy in Mexico. Actually stood up in front of the Union and said, this was our company and we're not meeting the service requirements and we\u2019ve got to help the company. And that was a -- they\u2019ve never done that before, it was a real breakthrough.","We came out of that meeting with a 9,000 foot train length and the ability to add the seven locomotives. We\u2019ve got some territories in Mexico that are very difficult coming out of Lazaro. And so to run a 9,000 foot train, it takes six to seven locomotives.","So if you think about it that gives you about a 25% capacity gain without adding additional labor. So it\u2019s a real breakthrough that is going to help us throughout the whole system. We\u2019ve been building the longer sightings, but we've just had shorter trains than we wanted.","So what we got queued up right now on the labor front is all of the training has been done and when we finish marking up people in August we're going to be over the hump. You've already seen the numbers.","The last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen big increases out of their simply because we\u2019ve had the labor to run the cruse. We\u2019re starting to pull the managers off the train, which is what we\u2019ve been doing but anyway Jeff I\u2019ll let you.","Jeff Songer","All right. I like to baseball analogy, I'll go ahead and say we\u2019re probably in the seventh innings. As I\u2019ve mentioned we\u2019ve made very good progress here in the last couple of months and we got a lot of guys in training now.","So getting that out of the union process, I think we've talked about in Q1 for the union has to provide the names to us that\u2019s done; so most of this is now in our hands to get these guys push to training and running trains.","The other very positive thing is again as I mentioned, we\u2019ve had these so called restrictions in train length and the amount of locomotives we can put per train, which really restricts our length and our productivity.","Now we're going to be able to figure those but we\u2019re just looking at out of Lazaro today for example, we\u2019re going to run a longer train, longer slab trains, we run 60 car trains. We're going to run 90s now today and crude trains will probably move from 90s to 120. So that\u2019s going to create some productivity and some efficiencies with cost.","The other thing keep in mind all these folks we're hiring, they're not, it\u2019s not guaranteed paid situation. So to think about it is back to your baseball analogy, we're going to have a little -- a better bench strength here. So what will happen, not having anybody as we have call-ins for sick or missed call, there was just nobody to call on to bring to run the train.","Some of this hiring as I mentioned was going to help support and get us a better bench strength to establish to handle attrition and to be able to work in through any rough times here as we go forward. So I\u2019 m very positive with the last few weeks negotiations with the labor and how the hiring is going.","Bill Greene","All right. Thanks for the time.","Operator","Thank you the next question is coming from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with you question.","Jason Seidl","Thank you very much. Gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for the time. Question is just on returning to the growth outlook that you guys executed so well for many, many years. Obviously sequentially it's looking a little bit better.","Given what's on your plate, are you looking at 2016 in terms of returning to car loading growth? And in that vein, I guess, Mike can you talk a little bit about that CapEx number and break it down between maintenance and growth spending? Thank you.","Pat Ottensmeye","I\u2019ll talk Jason, this is Pat. I\u2019ll cover the first part of that question and I think the answer is yes, depending on some of the energy sectors and crude oil prices and those kinds of things will obviously be a big factor in our outlook for 2016.","We\u2019re confident and have -- feel like we have pretty good transparence and visibility to what\u2019s going to happen in the second half of the year. As it relates to some of the other markets like the cross-border grain intermodal, automotive, Jeff did a great job of talking about some of the things we\u2019re doing to get our service back to where we expected and we think all of those things will put us in a solid position to grow -- to return to the growth in those markets that overall lot of it is going to depend on economy and the energy markets but we feel pretty good about that.","Mike can you talk about the capital?","Mike Upchurch","Jason, this is Mike. In an attempt to take slides out, we took that information out from last quarter but I'll go ahead and share that with you. Roughly 40% of our total capital dollars would be maintenance bucket. About 50% would be in what we would say growth equipment related needs capacity expansion, sightings and the other 10 would be split between G&A and PTC.","Jason Seidl","Okay. Fantastic. Gentlemen, thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Dave Starling","Good morning, Allison.","Allison Landry","How are you? So looking at the cross-border intermodal second consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines, have you lost any market share there to maybe some of your western competitors?","And based on the details that you've just talked in terms of the Mexico crude situation, what\u2019s your best assessment of when we might start to see improvement in volumes on the cross-border side?","Dave Starling","Answer to your first question is yes. And we\u2019ve lost market share to both other rail alternatives as well as truck particularly in the highly service sensitive auto parts business.","We\u2019re confident though and again we\u2019re basing this on our dialogue with customers and the three PLs that we do business with. As we improve our service and kind of get back to a level that we think will meet their expectations, we feel like we will get that back.","And then as we've said for a long time the market is large and it\u2019s growing and the opportunity is very significant. So we will get back on our feet and hopefully get back to the growth trajectory that you are used to seeing.","Allison Landry","Okay.","Dave Starling","Fundamentally we've changed, but there is no doubt that we\u2019ve -- this business that we had available that we couldn\u2019t handle and as a result we\u2019ve lost market share for the last few months.","Allison Landry","And is it fair to say it\u2019s sort of -- that you think that you're confident you will get it back, because it naturally belongs on your network?","Dave Starling","Yeah, I think the shippers and the intermediaries or we prefer rail, but when we are dealing with a customer that has service penalties built into their contracts and we\u2019re not performing at the level that they require, they\u2019re going t shift.","Allison Landry","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Kim","Great. Thanks. Pat, just a follow-on to the last question, can I ask you more specific to the cross-border intermodal, obviously it was weak again and I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to what extent it\u2019s due to labor versus equipment.","And then given the hiring and the additional equipment that you've brought on board when should we anticipate carloads, intermodal carloads and cross border to grow again?","Pat Ottensmeye","Well it\u2019s the same -- it's a combination of labor and equipment. It\u2019s kind of the old chicken and the egg. When we can\u2019t move trains and complete the cycles what happens is we flood the system with cars. Cars online increased and we just weren\u2019t getting the equipment to the right spot at the right time.","But all of that is getting better and again we\u2019re showing intermodal and particularly cross border intermodal is favorable on the one slide in the presentation. So we think we will get back in the positive territory here pretty quickly.","Dave Starling","Tom, this is Dave. I'll go out on a limb here and tell you that the last two weeks intermodal service is greatly improved. It\u2019s been very stable and the whip is coming out to get on the marketing guys to get the train filled again.","Tom Kim","Okay. That\u2019s fair enough. And then I know that pricing was certainly strong again in the second quarter and this is specific to the cross border intermodal but I do wonder to what extent your gain from that lost share just as a measure of goodwill is there a little bit of risk around pricing?","Dave Starling","No","Tom Kim","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Dave Starling","I can't talk that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Tom Wadewitz","Good morning. Wanted to see, Pat or Dave if you could translate some of the volume comments that seem to be a lot more feed in second half versus second quarter of first half? What do you think about total volume growth in the third quarter, fourth quarter?","ARE we transitioning to kind of less of a year-over-year decline in third quarter and a growth in forth or might you actually see growth in volume year-over-year in third quarter or how would you think about that?","And then I know it\u2019s tough visibility, but what about 2016? Is there are you kind of returning to normal volume growth that\u2019s 5%, 6% or just kind of broad thoughts on that as well? Thank you. ","Dave Starling","Tom I think I will limit my answer to the second half just because we've got better visibility there and I guess as I tried to characterize in my comments clearly what we've seen in the first half of the year is just a very rapid reduction in certain markets, energy related -- our coal business really couldn\u2019t be any worse than it was in the second quarter and really the entire first half","And then we definitely felt the impact of the service issue. So for the rest of the year third quarter, fourth quarter and as we continue to recover our service in Mexico and on the cross-border products we think we will see growth in the fourth quarter as well. 2016, I would like to withhold commentary on that until we get a little bit further into the year.","Tom Wadewitz","But in terms of year-over-year, I guess what seems like you\u2019re presenting it sequentially in terms of year-over-year would you expect volumes to be up in the third quarter or kind of less down less in second?","Dave Starling","Less down in the second. Yes.","Tom Wadewitz","And then maybe growth in fourth.","Dave Starling","Yes. Based on our kind of assessment of the current landscape yes.","Pat Ottensmeye","Keep this spreads where they are on the crude and will be in better shape as well.","Tom Wadewitz","Hot weather and wide spreads will help. Okay. All right, thank you for the time.","Dave Starling","Thanks Tom.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christian Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Dave Starling","Hi Chris.","Chris Wetherbee","Good morning guys. Maybe just piggybacking on to the last question there a little bit, taking a step further. In terms of the mix of volume versus resources, you're adding back again, trying to get service back to where it needs to be, should we feel confident that 2Q is probably the trough from an earnings perspective and any commentary you can give about the second-half outlook.","I know you don't have full-year guidance at this point, but how do you think about that? Seems like we're maybe past the worst, but want to get a rough sense of maybe we can start seeing flat to slightly positive earnings growth as we move through the back half of this year.","Mike Upchurch","Yes Chris. This is Mike. I think certainly on a sequential basis I think that\u2019s the case, but subject to the comments that Pat just made and Dave made around spreads and so forth, weather we're not going to make any commitments, we\u2019re not giving guidance, but I think sequentially it would appear to us sitting here today that we've hit bottom.","Dave Starling","The other thing Chris is the service is stable out of Mexico on the intermodal side. We got a new facility that opened in Wylie. That facility was constrained. It is no longer constrained.","So we should certainly do as well as the intermodal growth that\u2019s out in the market. So we're going to be pushing hard to grow Wylie because it is the fastest route to the Southeast and we now have a state-of-the-art terminal unlike the old clunky five-track, stub-in two hours to switch the train on the inbound, two hours to switch it on the outbound and not enough parking for customers.","So we\u2019re really going to push that facility hard and push that market hard and we think there are some players out there they want to be on that train.","Chris Wetherbee","So it sounds like keeping an eye on the weekly volumes and how those trend over the course of this quarter and next quarter is the indicator we should be keeping an eye on.","Dave Starling","Thant\u2019s exactly what we're doing and that's how we're trying to size right now we\u2019re being careful. We\u2019re being cautious as we bring cruise back and bring locomotives out, but we have been thrilled by the crude before. So we bought locomotives last year thinking the crude was going to be a great grow story in the first half of the year and it just wasn\u2019t.","And so now we\u2019re seeing the growth and we hope this is sustainable. The comment I made about the pipeline being we\u2019re being told as full from Canada down to Pad 3, but that\u2019s an indication and rails being used as they overflow and we think that\u2019s a good indication. Anyway that\u2019s the way we\u2019re reading it.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the time guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Troy","Yes, thanks and good morning. I just wanted to ask about coal. There had been an uptick in your outlook there. I know there was an outage in the first half, but what gives you confidence in this customer which has given your coal business a greater level of volatility than other railroads in the past that you can count on them in the back half of the year?","I'm just trying to get a little bit more comfortable because the swings have been so volatile. Are there steps you can take to get better compensated for this volume? So one, what gives you the confidence, and two, are there steps you can take in the relationship that might mitigate some of the volatility?","Dave Starling","The first one I guess the best answer I can give you at this moment is that they're running trains and they've pulled train sets out of storage and so we\u2019re actually seeing the volumes tick up.","You've seen the carloads volumes daily report that our utility coal business is up almost a 100% from last quarter. So again we've got more confidence and more visibility to the second half of the year than we do beyond that.","But you\u2019re other points are valid that I think for the next several months as Dave mentioned its hot in Texas and this is their season and where we feel confident in what they've told us that beyond that its we've kind of got to the point where we've adjusted the way we think about planning and forecasting to take into consideration our experience and the volatility that we've experienced with their customers.","Pat Ottensmeye","And I might add this we try not to talk about customer specific, but its more than one customer that's adding coal sets in.","Dave Starling","Yes that\u2019s a good point.","Matt Troy","Understood, and my follow-up would be simply if I look at your mix of traffic now, coal is somewhere in the mid single digits, 5% to 7%. If I look out a few years, your long-term guidance and goal of a low 60s OR, I think it's a great story.","If you can do that with that little coal given the volatility and structural uncertainty on a secular basis around the prospects for that commodity. Just to be clear, if we stay at 5%, 6% coal in terms of your mix, that low 60s OR is attainable. It basically contemplates coal not rebounding.","Dave Starling","That is correct. We are not looking at a lot of life out of coal beyond where we are today.","Pat Ottensmeye","Keep in mind if you look at the broader energy sector, crude oil plastics the Sassaw project is a ripple effect of the same set of circumstances that is causing our outlook for coal to be weak.","That\u2019s also very attractive business and will help us get to that OR target as the upside that we see in some of those other markets is more powerful than the downside we see in coal.","Dave Starling","And don\u2019t forget the automotive market out of Mexico and also intermodal where we think intermodal is still a bit growth engine for us.","Matt Troy","Good spot to be in, thank you guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ken Hoexter","Great, good morning. I guess just a clarification. You mentioned before the seventh inning -- in the seventh inning, is that on the recovery or is that of total productivity gains? But that's just a clarification.","My real question for Jeff is just wanted to dig into Mexico a bit more. Velocity has just been -- you mentioned in your charts dwell time and cars online, but velocity has been really volatile lately and really seemed to take a step down. So really amazed at the ability to get the expenses so low.","Can you talk about what's going on, on the velocity side and improving on the network? Is that related to everything in Mexico, or is there more going on in the U.S. that's impacting that?","Dave Starling","Yeah, our velocity as you hear for the last couple of three weeks is just technically in the U.S. has taking a bit of downturn. Nothing systemic there. We\u2019ve had our production gains just out of the Kansas City that\u2019s probably our most cumbersome area to work those guys that\u2019s planned and that\u2019s something we do every year.","So we\u2019ve got I think 10 more working days with those gangs here on the north, south route. And then they all pay up and go to less impactful territory. So nothing systemic, we thought is a normal some weather issues in the Southwest here.","The cross border initiatives we talked about, so really nothing systemic yet. We\u2019ve seen some of our velocity here in the last couple of weeks, but I look for that to rebound here pretty quickly.","Regarding your first question, I think my reference to seventh is kind of on a recovery. As I mentioned our total growth productivity gains I\u2019m very excited about, but we haven\u2019t really kicked the fires on a lot of that where there\u2019s new agreement on exactly how much that\u2019s going to benefit us with the length of train, but I\u2019m looking for good things I\u2019ll add to that.","Ken Hoexter","I appreciate the insight. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.","Dave Starling","Good morning Scott.","Scott Group","Thanks, good morning guys. So I get that you don't have guidance for the year, but just given the optimism that you're seeing on the volume front and the improvement, is it fair to think that you think we will see like a better than normal ramp in earnings from second quarter to the back half of the year?","Because that's what the Street has modeled. Just want to make sure you're comfortable with that directionally, that framework.","Mike Upchurch","Yeah, Scott this is Mike. I tried to address that on one of the earlier questions that from a earnings perspective I do think we\u2019ve hit bottom in the second quarter and given where we\u2019re at right now, what we\u2019re seeing in the business for the back half of the year, we would expect some improvement on a quarterly EPS perspective from 2Q in the back half of the year for those are sequential.","Scott Group","And you think it could be better than that normal sequential that we typically see given the recovery in volumes?","Mike Upchurch","I\u2019m not going to quite go there, but let\u2019s just say we believe we hit bottom in the second quarter on EPS and believe we\u2019ll see some sequential increases going through the back half of the year.","Scott Group","Okay, and then can you just help -- the comp per employee was down 9% year over year and just help us understand the drivers of that and how sustainable that is.","Mike Upchurch","The -- I\u2019m sorry the compensation.","Scott Group","The compensation per employee.","Mike Upchurch","I think we\u2019ll try to give you a little bit of guidance in the index around some of the declines there, but yet a $6 million benefit in foreign exchange and a $6 million benefit in lower incentives those will be the big drivers. Thanks Scott.","Scott Group","Thank you, guys.","Mike Upchurch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Just had a quick question on Lazaro, if you can give us an update there on APM expansion. And sequentially the volumes haven't improved since the first quarter. I imagine a lot has to do with the service issues.","But is the expansion something that -- is that what you really need to get that growth back into the low to mid teens or can you start to improve on that with better service and this new ability to run fairly longer trains out of that port?","Dave Starling","I want to say yes is that okay. We did if you look at the appendix we did see Lazaro recover to pretty attractive growth rates and in spite of challenges in our operating team kind of really doing pulling around that's sort of hat to keep up with it.","So Lazaro is back on a good growth trajectory. The APM terminal longer term we think is going to be a very positive for just the overall attractiveness of the port. They expect the first vessel to arrive in the spring of next year.","And we\u2019re getting ready for that in terms of cruise and equipment and then track infrastructure around the port. So long-term I think that\u2019s going to be a very positive development for us.","So we feel very good about the intermodal opportunity for Lazaro and then all the things that Jeff mentioned in terms of the crew based the longer trains, the additional locomotives will help us better service.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay, great, and then just one quick follow-up. You mentioned competition at the port as being a favorable impact for the second-half outlook versus the first. I know at one point you mentioned that some of the carriers were asking for currency adjustments.","Is that still an active discussion since the peso has gotten even weaker first half this year, or is that something that the competition for the space can in the improving service can really negate and you aren't really seeing that type of pushback? Thanks.","Dave Starling","We\u2019re not actually seeing pushback. We\u2019re still in dialogue. We\u2019re still hearing kind of fairly high level of interest in that but, I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve seen a lot of pushback and obviously it hasn\u2019t affected our growth coming out of Lazaro.","Brian Ossenbeck","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.","Dave Starling","How are you Justin?","Justin Long","Hi, good morning and thanks. Just based on your conversations with customers lately, I was wondering if you could share your bigger picture take on the Mexican economy and the freight environment there.","Does the outlook feel better in Mexico versus the US? Are there concerns with the move we've seen in oil prices? What's your opinion on where we're generally headed from here?","Mike Upchurch","This is Mike, I think generally that their growth has been little bit less than projected over the last year or so, but I think fundamentally that economy is turning down. We\u2019re seeing record levels of foreign direct investment being made particularly in the auto sector. We thought that length of that all the new plans that are coming online there some of the biggest manufactures in the world are being facilities in Mexico.","That longer term while the initial auction results may be have been great we certainly think that\u2019s going to be a big opportunity for us moving forward.","So generally speaking I think their economy is fairly solid and we would hope to see a little bit of an uptick. With two thirds of what's manufactured in Mexico moving into the U.S., they\u2019re very closely tied to our economy and certainly we\u2019ve been lackluster here in the first half of the year. Jose, do you have anything that you would like to add?","Jose Zozaya","Well, I just would like to complete what Mike just said and reinforce the idea of foreign investment that keeps coming very fluently to Mexico. I\u2019ve been present at several announcements of President, Pena Nieto doing because of increase on the foreign investment coming into the concrete. So that shows a lot of interest and a lot of confidence in the country.","Mike Upchurch","Just picking up on your comment or question about the customer perspective, if you look at the key drivers in our business automotive that\u2019s going to grow because the new plans intermodal trade between U.S. and Mexico continues to grow and then we\u2019ve got a huge opportunity with market share gains from truck to rail.","The whole energy market is still much -- to much degree -- to a large degree unknown, but we are seeing a lot of interest right now in the movement of refined products from the U.S. Gulf to Mexico and I think I have said in the past several quarters that we actually feel that\u2019s going to be -- our first opportunity is moving refined products into Mexico and then eventually we will see production movement of frac sand, crude by rail and other markets as well so.","So putting all that together, I think we still feel very, very good about the prospectus for growth in Mexico.","Justin Long","Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful color. I appreciate the time.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks Justin.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Brandon Oglenski","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for getting us on here. Dave or Jeff, I just want to come back to this Mexico service issue because it looks like if you go back maybe a year and a half, two years in the network, you've been moving over 12 million RTMs each quarter for quite some time.","So can you just walk us through again what precisely happened out of Mexico that lead to this disruption and inability to take more volume on to the network?","Dave Starling","We didn\u2019t hire enough crews.","Brandon Oglenski","But you had enough crews in the past so your hiring plans went down. Is that the problem here?","Dave Starling","We did not hire enough crews and for attrition as you start to get behind then you have dig out and when you start trying to dig out, it takes even more crews as we had explained in the past when you get behind and then you have to start re-crewing the same train three times then it just speeds on itself so that\u2019s exactly what happened.","Brandon Oglenski","All right, well thank you for the clarification, and Pat, if I can just get one in here. It's normal I think to see sequential acceleration in the back half of the year for your Company and broadly for the industry.","Are you calling for better than normal seasonal activity on your volume, and that feeds into the whole issue that you will be having the right crews in place?","Dave Starling","No, I wouldn\u2019t say that, again I think we feel we have pretty good visibility in the back half. Is it going to be normal? I don\u2019t know. A lot of it depends on how quickly we get some of the business that we feel has moved away from us as we demonstrate our service improvements on the cross border as well as continued strength in the energy markets. Thanks Brandon.","Brandon Oglenski","Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Tyler Franz with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.","Tyler Franz","Hi, good morning, guys.","Dave Starling","Tyler, how are you?","Tyler Franz","Dave, so one thing I've noticed is that your Sanchez blocking yard dwell has really improved over the last few weeks. So first, is that the key metric we should be looking at regarding northern Mexico fluidity?","And secondly, can you talk about the implications of the Sanchez expansion and what that might have on your Mexican main line even bridge capacity and just service overall in Mexico?","Dave Starling","I\u2019m going to led Jeff take that one but I'll tell you, I\u2019m going to say the same thing I told my CFO, be real careful when you look at one yard and say looks like we\u2019re behind here, It look like the network is in trouble because what happens a place like Sanchez which is the lunched to the border crossing, we can be easily be holding four or five trains there to cross the border for the window and at 7\u2019o clock in the morning, it can look like it\u2019s too high and 3\u2019o clock in the afternoon it looks like it\u2019s low.","The same thing happens on Laredo. The same thing even happened when people started looking at Dwell and Shreveport in the U.S. The Shreveport count went up because we were doing blocking in Shreveport to help Mexico.","So Jeff very astutely moved some of his work around on our network in the U.S. to help Mexico and it pushed our Dwell up. So it is a network and we do run it as one network. So you\u2019ll see those numbers move around but to just be careful about I think what you got to look at over time is just the total Dwell numbers.","Jeff Songer","Yes, I agree completely there, Dave and Sanchez and Monterey and Laredo, all the yards on the North in Mexico have shown kind of some pretty consistent improvement here as of late.","The Sanchez expansion kind of touching on that for a minute, I think I highlighted in Q1 the benefit of that project it really removes us from Laredo and similar to the Zacha versus Wylie facility, the current switching operation that we do to shove trains across-the-Board is just very inefficient because of the track layout in Laredo.","So we\u2019ve got to drag out trains and double our train on to the main line which blocks the main line. So it\u2019s just inefficient. Sanchez is going to allow us to build trains, to build multiple trains in Sanchez ready to stage at the border.","So we currently operate North window for six hours and then switch to Southbound window for six hours that lets us build trains during the opposite flow and as soon as that gate opens up cross the border we will be able to shove more efficiently trains do there.","So we\u2019re very excited about Sanchez project and as I said, we\u2019re going to have some of those tracks on here at the end of August, which is a little ahead of schedule. So we\u2019ll start seeing some benefit while we finish up the entire project and then just roll right into the 2016 project with additional class tracks and be able to block some more trains.","Dave Starling","And I would like to add, the yard at Sanchez, the classification yard for next year, our biggest interchange partner is Union Pacific at the Laredo Border and this was allow us to do some blocking for the UP at Sanchez that will help their network, but it also allows the UP to do some blocking for us which helps our network.","So we\u2019re going to be able to work with each other on the benefits of Sanchez to improve the whole velocity between those two railroads and that\u2019s something we\u2019re very excited about it.","Tyler Franz","Okay. That's great color, and then just following up, so we've heard a lot about network balance that's being a big issue for cross-border intermodal. It seems that the IMCs are just simply reluctant to send equipment into Mexico.","And I get that Wylie is really good for call it domestic intermodal and Dallas putting traffic over the speedway, but does it have any big again implications to the ability to build empty trains back into Mexico to help rebalance that network?","Dave Starling","You\u2019ve been reading our playbook, that's exactly what we do as the empties build in Dallas and we do have some loaded traffic that's actually moving to Mexico over Dallas, but that\u2019s how we get one of our major ways of getting the empties back into Mexico and remember we don\u2019t have the IMC. So we\u2019re really with the asset players like Hunt Swift and Schneider.","And so we will reposition because we have to reposition the cars in the Mexico anyway. So we will reposition those empties down from Wiley down into Mexico and then become a North end load. So that\u2019s exactly what we are doing.","Tyler Franz","Okay. Perfect. Thank you for the time.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Please proceed with your question.","Bascome Majors","Yes, good morning. It's encouraging to hear about the improving labor relations and operational flexibilities in Mexico, and certainly your optimism towards sequential volume increases in the second half.","Can you talk a little bit about how much ability you now have to adjust crew resources in Mexico lower if demand does down shift down the road and you end up with excess crew capacity after you reach your headcount targets in late 2015 here?","Mike Upchurch","Yes it\u2019s good observation and we kind of talked about climbing out of service issues probably require more heads than we would probably run rate normally, but the attrition rate again, that\u2019s something that I\u2019ve always found correct, it's very quickly with attrition.","The other thing we\u2019re going to see is I touched on is these efficiencies with longer trains and additional locomotives that\u2019s going to help and that's going to help drive down that things requirement.","So we\u2019re viewing this as we're getting staffed up. We're building extra boards. We're building extra capacity with those crews, but then we will continue to right size as we start to see the benefits, the new labor agreements and the length of train. So that\u2019s another metric we'll be looking at here going forward.","Dave Starling","So the thing we're concerned about though is you got to remember the auto plants that we will be opening in Mexico. We just got to be very cautious that we don\u2019t get ourselves in a position we were in before.","So you will see us with ample labor in Mexico and just to remember the cost is a lot different down there as well.","Bascome Majors","Thanks, can you size up the attrition rate in Mexico just to give us a bogey for how quickly you can take that down if it's needed?","Dave Starling","Well don't forget we can still furlough crews in Mexico if we need to. So there is no rule that says we can't furlough if we need to.","Mike Upchurch","Yes, it\u2019s about a 5% to 6% a year that number on average.","Bascome Majors","All right. Thanks a lot for that guys.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kauffman","Thank you very much. Hi guys. Just looking at the cross-border grain volumes, how much of what you're not doing right now year to year do you think is more of a operating issue and how much of it do you believe are factors such as currency or things that may be changing that market just in terms of say the next 6 to 12 months?","Mike Upchurch","I would say it\u2019s all related to servicing congestion.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay, so you would expect cross-border grain volume when you get service back to go back to what you were doing second half of last year?","Mike Upchurch","Second half is pretty strong last year, although last year we have the impact of the congestion across the rails in North America. So I would say yes to your question.","The only thing we got to be careful with is remember some of our grain actually comes to us in connection at Kansas City. It doesn\u2019t all originate on us. So there has been some congestion North of us that has caused some problems with the water.","So it\u2019s not all ours, but our system in the U.S. is flowing very nicely today but again we had some congestion North of us that's created problems on origins.","Jeff Kauffman","Okay guys, that\u2019s what I want. Thank you.","Dave Starling","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.","Cleo Zagrean","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. My first question relates to pricing in the energy line. Is that 9% decline excluding foreign exchange and fuel mostly mix? Can you comment at all on same-store price especially for your utility coal business and how we can expect that to trend now that we've reached some bottom there? Thank you.","Dave Starling","Most of our utility coal business is priced off of indexes RCAF or AILF. So the rate increases have been reflective of what\u2019s happened with those and they\u2019ve been very low and that\u2019s usually the way the contracts work and so we would not expect pricing in the coal business to be as strong as our overall portfolio.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay, and then in the chemicals segment, very nice performance there, price up 10%, right, excluding foreign exchange and fuel. Can you comment a little bit on the drivers there? Chemicals, petroleum plastics, Mexico versus U.S., appreciate any insights, thank you.","Dave Starling","It\u2019s certainly been strong on both sides that as I mentioned it\u2019s the one area of business unit for the quarter where we\u2019ve seen some strength that particularly in plastics and petroleum in Mexico. I think we\u2019ve actually cited some of the changes over the last few quarters that we have instated with Pamex moving refined products from Central Mexico to the Port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas.","We\u2019ve changed the way we support that business moving more to a unit train type of service and that has created both yield and efficiency gains.","Cleo Zagrean","Okay, and then to people who are concerned as to whether such strong performance means tough for next year, what would you say? Thank you.","Dave Starling","I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t hear.","Cleo Zagrean","In terms of pricing ex-energy doing so well this year, what do you think we can expect for next?","Dave Starling","No change, yes.","Cleo Zagrean","Very nice.","Dave Starling","Thank you. Last but not least.","Operator","Our final question is coming from the line of John Barnes of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","John Barnes","Thanks guys. I appreciate.","Dave Starling","For last John.","John Barnes","I do what I can. Hi, just on the Mexican labor situation, given what you outlined in your slide in terms of train length and number of locomotives and that type of thing, how does that impact the level of employment that you need in Mexico on a going forward basis, and does it necessarily -- is it a buffer to prevent this labor shortage from cropping up again?","Jeff Songer","If I understand the question, let me see if I get that, so the current hiring as I mentioned allows for kind of future attrition and extra board activity. So the current hiring path provides for some of that cushion if you will.","The productivity gain that we should see with the length of train should decrease the overall requirement, but as Pat mentioned there\u2019s some volume that did move, because of service.","So for me right size give us cushion on the extra boards for unforeseen or outages and then continue to scale appropriately with the volume knowing that we\u2019re going to have some efficiency gains on length of train.","Dave Starling","I think the key driver John is the reduction in train starts to move the same volume. So you\u2019re going to get some incremental revenue on that basis when you can add 25% of the same train that\u2019s pretty good swing.","John Barnes","Yeah and that's what I was getting at is you pick it up on train size, and so does it mean that a normal year that may need 500 hires now becomes 300 hires? That's what I'm getting at. Does it reduce the necessary labor force?","Jeff Songer","I would look more that it\u2019s going to enable us to handle the growing volume and so again Dave mentioned running a 25% more trains that\u2019s four trains for about the price of three so -- and that\u2019s also going to help congestion and just help the overall capacity of that line to be able to handle more volume. Lazaro had some good volume this year.","John Barnes","Very, good, very good and then just one clarification on that. Did you give up anything, negotiations are always give and take, what did you give up in order to realize this productivity gain? Was there a wage increase, was there anything you had to give to the union?","Jeff Songer","Sure our negotiations are both ways, but things for example on the longer train the 3,000 meter trains we will add additional brakeman, which is something we would probably want to do anyways for the overall safety of the operations and the flow of those.","So now in addition to those numbers the efficiencies you've added a kind of additional wavier and small additional waiver on some of the trains should be more than offset with the productivity gains on the length of train.","Dave Starling","And the other thing too John there\u2019s some of the lengths we got because of the locomotive usage that you actually upsize the train and you don\u2019t get into the third of the third crewman.","So there\u2019s kind of -- you got to get out almost for the max to get out to their third group. So these first trains we're adding out of Lazaro don\u2019t even get to the -- through the third crew number.","John Barnes","Very good. Very good. Thanks for the time guys.","Dave Starling","All right. Thank you. That concludes our call for today. So thank you and we\u2019ll see you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation."],"12618":["Kansas City Southern (NYSE:KSU) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 19, 2019  8:45 AM ET","Company Participants","Pat Ottensmeyer - President & CEO","Jeff Songer - EVP & COO","Sameh Fahmy - EVP, Precision Scheduled Railroading","Mike Naatz - EVP & CMO","Mike Upchurch - EVP & CFO","Conference Call Participants","Chris Wetherbee - Citigroup","Amit Mehrotra - Deutsche Bank","Justin Long - Stephens","Samantha Yellen - Credit Suisse","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Brian Ossenbeck - J.P.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.","This presentation includes statements concerning potential future events involving the company which could materially differ from events that actually occur. The differences could be caused by a number of factors, including those factors identified in the Risk Factors section of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC. The Company is not obligated to update any forward-looking statements in this presentation to reflect future events or developments. All reconciliations to GAAP can be found on the KCS website, www.kcsouthern.com.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Pat Ottensmeyer, President and Chief Executive Officer for Kansas City Southern.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Just to make a comment on Slide 4, which is the list of the line up for today\u2019s presentation. I\u2019m not going to read through this. I think it is very well known to the audience here. So I will move on to Slide 5 with a quick overview of the quarter and a few headliners.","As you saw from the press release, revenues increased 5% to a record level for any quarter of $714 million. Second quarter operating ratio, little bit of explaining necessary here. We reported a 70.9% operating ratio, which includes the impact of impairment charge, additional impairment charge we took in the second quarter. Adjusting for that impairment charge, we got to 63.7%, which is a 30 basis point improvement from last year. That included negative impact of 130 basis points of pure accounting, I will say, related to the loss of the IEPS tax credit and the increase of fuel surcharge revenue.","Mike Upchurch will go through this in much greater detail later and explain the 130 basis points and probably more importantly explain what this looks like going forward. This is really pure accounting as we're just inflating the revenue side as well as the cost side of our income statement, which has a negative effect on the operating ratio, but has very little effect on operating income or other things that matter as you go down the income statement.","So I think it is correct to look at the 30 basis point improvement from the adjusted level, excluding the impairment charge as well as the 130 basis point excise tax impact that we absorbed or overcame in the quarter due to the pure accounting consequences of both higher fuel costs and higher fuel surcharge revenue. And I think Mike has a slide later on that goes through that in really good detail.","Second quarter diluted EPS, $1.28. Adjusted again for the impairment charge was at a record $1.64, increase of 6% versus prior-year. Couple of key themes that we will probably cover 2x or 3x over the course of the call and Q&A. Operating performance significantly improve, which drove improved customer service. Operating metrics and cost profile, again looking at the improvement in core operational savings, which is the 30 basis points year-over-year plus overcoming the impact of the fuel, the IEPS, the tax situation.","And as you'll see later on we\u2019re making great progress in PSR implementation and other operational excellence initiatives. And we are going to give you updated guidance on the full-year impact and kind of the 2019 impact of those savings and those initiatives, and the punchline is, we're more than doubling the positive impact of those savings.","I am very, very pleased with the commitment and enthusiasm of the team. It's truly a cross functional. It's a very high level of commitment and engagement across the organization. We\u2019ve weekly PSR update meetings, led by Sameh, with a large number of people from many different organizations. And I said on those periodically, I sat in on the meeting we had on Wednesday of this week and is just very, very pleased with the level of engagement that we're seeing.","Another common theme and that you will hear more, I mean, obviously the volume outlet, outlook or volume performance was not as strong as we would have like. Volume is basically flat. But there's a story behind that, that I think Mike Naatz will reveal in his comments that we look at our portfolio of business and breakdown by business unit going forward.","We still see 60% of our portfolio as favorable in terms of the growth that we are seeing, 10% -- I\u2019m sorry, 20% neutral. So that could flip either way as circumstances develop and market conditions change over the course of the year and only 20% negative. And as you can see in the difference between our Carload volumes and our revenues, there is a mix story here. So we certainly don't see gloom and doom ahead of us and opportunities for growth in some of the oversized growth areas that we\u2019ve talked about for the last several quarters.","And the PSR work we\u2019re doing, the focus on operational excellence has put our network in really terrific position to deliver strong operating leverage as and when volume growth and revenue growth improve and Mike again will give you more detail on our estimates, our current estimates for PSR savings going forward.","Flipping to Slide 6, just want to update our guidance. This is similar guidance. Categories that we gave at the end of the first quarter and we\u2019re changing a couple of these. Volume growth we now see flat to slightly down for the full-year in 2019. But again I'll restate what I said a minute ago, when Michael get into this in more detail. When we look at our total portfolio, we think 60% of our business is showing favorable positive trends, 20% neutral and 20% negative, which includes Intermodal which of course is driving the big explanation between the flat volume levels, but continuing to hang in there with our revenue guidance that we gave earlier which was 5% to 7% for the full-year. Same guidance we gave at the end of the first quarter, so we still feel that that revenue growth is going to be possible for us this year.","Operating ratio, we are moving to the low end of our previous guidance of 60% to 61% by 2021. And I will again bring up the impact of the fuel tax issue, the loss of the IEPS tax credit. So not only are we going to the low end of the range, but we are absorbing the impact of the loss with the IEPS credit and the inflation of the balance sheet, both on the cost and the revenue side that, that will have to operating ratio going forward. And as I mentioned Mike will get into a more detail about the magnitude of that during the quarter and then going forward.","EPS, we're staying with our previous guidance of low to mid teens on a compound annual growth rate for the next three years. So no change in EPS. And then, CapEx, we are bringing our capital expenditure forecast for 2019 down. We are confident that we will be able to trim our CapEx forecast from previous guidance by $40 million to $60 million. Our previous guidance was $640 million to $660 million for 2019. We now expect that number to come in below $600 million. And again, a lot of that is a function of improved operational efficiency.","And we're really just beginning -- in fact had a kickoff meeting here a couple weeks ago with the team who is looking at completely redesigning our transportation service plan, as Sameh will refer to this as whiteboarding when he gets into his comments, which we think will have further benefits in the second half of this year and beyond in terms of the number of train starts and the yard congestion and overall improvement in our operating performance.","So, with that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer.","Jeff Songer","All right. Thank you, Pat. Good morning. Starting with the review of key operating metrics for the quarter on Slide 8. Dwell of 21.2 hours, improved 11% year-over-year, while gross velocity of 12.5 mile per hour improved 9% year-over-year. We continue to see strong year-over-year improvement in our key metrics, particularly in Mexico were dwell across the majority of our major terminals has shown significant improvement.","Flooding had some impact velocity interchange in the North end of the U.S network as we encourage several days of outages across some segments. The greatest impact was to interchange of bulk commodities in Kansas City. Regarding asset utilization, I would like to highlight that the number of operational cars online has decreased 17% versus peak 2018 levels. Our focus has been to reduce high cost foreign equipment by improving cycle times and working with customers to right size fleets.","Border performance for the quarter remain solid and supported a 10% year-over-year growth in cross-border volumes, led by significant growth in Mexico Energy Reform shipments. A milestone was reached in our border operations in July as international crews have now been in place for one year. This initiative continues to support cross-border volume and we're seeing a 20% reduction in time spent crossing the bridge for those trains utilizing international crews.","Expanding upon PSR metrics on Slide 9, we continue to see positive trends in all metrics. Through the first half of the year, gross velocity has improved 10% versus prior-year and we're now tracking this metric to exit the year at 14 miles per hour. Reductions in line of road equipment failures, improved execution of TSP and modifications to our service design and reduced train starts have all helped to a system fluidity.","Train length improved by 2% as our TSP and train starts consolidation work continues. In the second half of the year, we will undergo additional service redesign, which Sameh will discuss in more detail.","Fuel efficiency has improved by 3% for the year. Multiple initiatives, including velocity improvements, locomotive utilization, train start reductions and fuel technology are all contributing to this improvement. In the second half of the year, we will install fuel technology on an additional 100 road locomotives, which will bring us to roughly 50% of our road fleets equipped.","Also, of note, we\u2019ve received all 50 of the new locomotives planned for 2019 and do not currently plan any locomotive purchases for 2020. As Pat indicated, we feel very good about the progress and pace of our PSR initiatives and as you will see in Mike's financial review, we are more than doubling the expected PSR cost benefits for the full-year 2019.","I will now turn the presentation over to Sameh to provide more detail on our overall PSR efforts.","Sameh Fahmy","Good morning. As Jeff mentioned, we have been making significant improvements in network velocity in about 10% that are year-over-year and well about 8% better. We are seeing the best consolidated gross velocity this time of year across the network than we have seen in any of the last five years. We also see further improvements ahead as on many days we achieve 15, 16 miles per hour in U.S and 13, 14 miles per hour in Mexico. These are much higher numbers than the average of 11 miles per hour reported last year.","These improvements were achieved by very hard work every day by the whole operation team with intense focus on every low velocity train and peeling the onion on causes. Example, a train that arrives in Nuevo Laredo and departs 24 hours later as it waited for a window to cross the border bridge. That has also been an intense effort to scrutinize work in yards. As an example, Vanegas having nine trains doing work versus a planned six.","As we drill down, we find that cars were added to a train in Sanchez and now needed to be switched out in Vanegas which is not our best yard for switching. Velocity which is not our best yard for switching. Velocity and dwell gains translated into the removal of 12% of our locomotives and 7% of our cars and great improvement in fuel efficiency.","In addition, four waves of train consolidation resulted in a 10% reduction in planned line of road crew starts in Mexico. We continue to focus our efforts into converting our operational gains to the bottom line and as Pat mentioned, Mike Upchurch is going to go more into the financial details of this.","Now moving forward, the same way as a field visit to Houston in March brought fruits in partnership was -- was Union Pacific. A one week visit to San Luis Potos\u00ed in June was a true eye opener. We observed a low level of compliance to plan with yard assignments adjusted daily, which is an indication of a suboptimal train plan with field personal trying to compensate for the deficiencies.","But by doing so they create impure car blocks that need to be a reclassified in the next yard, and the one after that and so on downstream. This is when it became clear that a new redesign, the whiteboarding as Pat mentioned earlier, needs to be done was great focus on yard and the border and will be completed in Q4. The objective will be to eliminate excessive classifications, free up capacity, increase velocity of reduced dwell and improve service.","As you know an important part of PSR is to create capacity for free. And we're taking a big chunk out of our original capital plan as Mike will describe in this presentation. Example, money that was set aside to upgrade yards is being taken out and we are going to the side, what to do with that when the plan, the new design plan for trains and for classification and for yards is completed.","An immediate action ahead of the new TSP is to implement on August 12 a new blocking agreement for northbound traffic interchanging with the UP at Laredo that will emphasize creating blocks at origin points, further south in our network and will reduce a significant portion of the switching at Nuevo Laredo yard. That will reduce the number of times we touch a car, which again is one of the key principles of PSR.","Mechanical delays will also be a great focus. We have made significant improvement in failures per day per year in auto locomotive from 4.6% down to 3.1%, but will still have lots of room to go to take it down to 2.0 and we still have a lot of room to go on cars. We get about 40 to 45 hours of train delays per day due to mechanical and that can be cut substantially and we\u2019re working on it.","Last and this has come up on the -- in the past couple of days, we are also beginning to shift focus to the engineering side to increase the productivity of our gangs, ties per hour and rail per hour -- rail footage per hour, and that would allow us to shrink the curfews and affect less the train delays and at the same time improve our capital dollar.","I will turn it now to Mike Naatz for the commercial slide.","Mike Naatz","Thank you, Sameh, and good morning everyone. I will start my comments on Page 13. Overall, second quarter revenue was up 5% on flat volumes. As you can see our Q2 performance was mixed across business units. We continue to see very strong performance in our cross-border traffic, led by the Mexico Energy Reform business and this drove growth in our cross-border revenue and volumes of 13% and 10%, respectively. We are mindful of the economic environmental trade situation and we continue to carefully monitor the current state of affairs. And as you\u2019ve heard from Pat, 80% of our portfolio have a favorable or neutral outlook.","During the quarter, our revenue per unit grew by about 4%, driven by a shift in business mix from the lower revenue per unit intermodal volumes to the higher revenue per unit chemical and petroleum business. Increased fuel revenues also affected our revenue per unit. During the quarter, we achieved pricing renewals consistent with the prior year and we view the current pricing environment is stable.","As expected, the Chemical and Petroleum segment delivered strong quarterly year-over-year results with our Mexico Energy Reform business providing revenue growth of 136% and volume growth of 125%. Our Ag\/Min units showed a slight year-over-year volume decrease to a large part to an unexpected customer outage and timing of volumes contributing to tougher year-over-year comps.","However, we continue to see favorable transportation cycle times, resulting from the benefits of operational improvements at cross-border traffic. We expect to see this trend continue into the second half. Energy volumes were down due to decreases in frac sand and Canadian crude or partially offset year-over-year growth in utility coal traffic. And this was despite the flooding impact that occurred in the second quarter.","Year-over-year revenue in our industrial consumer business unit was down 2% and 7% lower volumes. The volume declines were primarily attributable to softness in the paper market, which was driven by abundant truck capacity and a shift from cardboard to alternative packaging methods. The Automotive segment saw revenue increase of 5% on flat volumes. Plans were impacted by planned outages early in the quarter and we expect year-over-year growth to improve in the second half of the year as plants reopened and new production begins to slowly ramp up.","Intermodal segment was down slightly, seeing a 1% reduction in revenue and a 3% decrease in volumes. We continue to see strong growth in our cross-border intermodal business with a 10% increase in volume and a 7% increase in revenue. This was offset by decreases in domestic traffic due to truck availability and the Lazaro volumes and revenues were up 2% and 4%, respectively.","Moving on to Slide 14. You will see our revenue outlook for the second half of 2019. And as pat mentioned, we are expecting year-over-year volume to be flat to slightly down, but we do maintain our revenue guidance on the lower end of the 5% to 7% range. We remain very positive on the chemical and petroleum business unit and the Mexico Energy Reform story.","Additionally, we expect to see growth in the Automotive and Ag and Min segments, primarily due to continuing service improvements. The Industrial and Consumer segment outlook is adjusted to neutral for the second half of 2019, given recent trends in the paper markets and available truck capacity. And truck availability paired with pricing impacts have increased fuel costs will drive a somewhat unfavorable second half outlook for our intermodal business unit.","And with that, I will turn things over to CFO, Mike Upchurch.","Mike Upchurch","Good morning, everyone. I will start my comments on Slide 16. Second quarter revenues were up 5%, primarily due to a 4% increase in revenue per unit. Reported operating expenses increased $69 million, primarily due to a restructuring charge of $51 million consisting largely of an impairment of locomotives and freight cars no longer required in our business.","Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% leading to a 63.7 adjusted operating ratio for the quarter. It is important to note that the Mexican government's decision to terminate the fuel excise tax credit for the rail industry beginning April 30, 2019 had a negative impact on our adjusted operating ratio of approximately 130 basis points. I will review more details on the impact to our financial statements on the next slide.","Setting aside the negative impacts of the loss for the fuel excise tax credit, our operating performance was far better than our reported or adjusted results. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29.2% in line with the 29% to 30% guidance we provided. For 2019, we do expect our full-year adjusted ETR to be in the range of 27% to 28% due to the Mexican fuel excise tax been included in income taxes.","Since IEPS is now been eliminated for the remainder of 2019, we will no longer adjust the fuel excise tax credit in the operating expenses. In June, the Treasury Department proposed additional guidance concerning guilty tax and we now expect our effective tax rate to be 28% to 29% in 2020 and beyond. And from a cash tax rate perspective, we're forecasting 2019 to be 21%, 2020 to be 23% and 2021 to be 25%.","And while the Treasury Department has largely solved concerns that caused unintended consequences to KCS, we will still end up paying approximately $16 million in taxes in 2018 and 2019 that we believe were not intended under the principles of Tax Reform Act of 2017.","Finally reported EPS was a $1.28, which is inclusive of a $0.38 impact related to our restructuring charge. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $1.64 and was predominantly due to increased operating income, although we also saw some benefit in reduced share count.","Turning to Slide 17, I want to now review the estimated impacts of the loss of the IEPS fuel tax credit. In the first column just represents our adjusted 2Q results through operating income. The second column represents the estimated 2Q impact of losing the fuel tax credit beginning April 30. And the amount of 2Q revenue build the customers in our fuel program that started May 11.","As you can see, we recorded an incremental $7.2 million in revenue during the quarter that would not have been recorded had the excise tax credit been retained. Offsetting that incremental revenue is the $13.6 million lost fuel excise tax credit resulting in $6.4 million less operating income during the second quarter or a 130 basis point negative impact to OR.","The final column is our attempt to provide you some guidance for future quarterly periods. The final column reflects the same loss, excise tax credit of $13.6 million, offset with an estimated $12.8 million recovery in our fuel program. We do not recover a 100% of loss credit as some customers who have all-inclusive rates including fuel costs that won't be able to be adjusted until contracts expire.","As illustrated by the operating income impact of less than a $1 million in the quarter, we do not expect a material impact to operating income or net income from the lost fuel excise tax credit. However, moving the lost fuel excise tax credit from expenses into our fuel program will create an approximate 80 basis point deterioration in our OR since the increased fuel expense will have essentially an equal amount of fuel surcharge revenue.","So if there is three takeaways here, the quarter was considerably better, if you set aside the loss for the credit. There's an immaterial impact to operating income and net income, but we do have the dynamics of an 80 basis point increase in our operating ratio as a result of moving the credit into revenues.","So with that, let's turn to more exciting things on Slide 18. I want to provide you an update on our PSR expense savings. On our first quarter call, we reviewed an initial PSR saving estimate with you. At that time, we had visibility into a reduction of approximately $16 million of 2019 expenses or $25 million annually. After an additional quarter of work, we now have visibility to 2019 expenses that are 2.5x our previous estimates or $40 million for 2019 and $55 million annually.","As you can see in the slide, we're seeing better progress in every single expense category. Some of our early initiatives that focused on reducing the size of the fleet, particularly older less reliable locomotives. Not only are we seeing depreciation and maintenance benefits from a reduced fleet, we\u2019re also experiencing fuel benefits by shedding older less fuel-efficient locomotives. And we\u2019ve improved the reliability of the fleet by reducing service interruptions by 35% and reducing the duration of service interruptions by 15% or 45% that have led to a 15% reduction in our mechanical resources.","With respect to fuel, we are also beginning to see more savings materialize from the adoption of fuel saving technologies, such as GE's trip optimizer to run trains in the most fuel-efficient gear or notch, AESS to minimize idling time and smart HPT to right size the locomotive power being used for each train. Additionally, train consolidation is also helping fuel efficiency by running longer trains.","So in summary, we will continue to aggressively pursue more expense savings as we streamline our operations and develop a new transportation service plan. In the quarter, we did incur a $51 million restructuring charge which is predominantly related to disposal of more locomotives and freight cars that we won't need in our business. As we continue to develop plans to streamline our operations, it is possible we could have further restructuring charges in the future since for we are only six months into our efforts.","Turning to Slide 19. Quarterly adjusted operating expenses increased 4% over 2Q 2018. KCS generated a fuel excise tax credit of $8 million in the second quarter of '18, but obviously no credit in operating income in 2019 due to the change in tax laws, thus creating a negative year-over-year comp.","Wage inflation of 3% in the U.S and 5% in Mexico led to a $4 million increase in compensation costs and foreign exchange contributed $2 million increase. Offsetting those increases were $2 million in savings from an improvement in fuel-efficiency, $1 million in labor savings due to crew start reductions and $4 million of improvement in equipment expense, the result of a more fluid network as we saw our foreign cycle times continue to improve 8% year-over-year.","On Slide 20, compensation and benefits expense increased $6 million or 5%. Average quarterly headcount excluding the in-sourcing of a mechanical facility and in-sourcing of IT contractors declined 50 basis points. Wage inflation increased comp and benefits by $4 million and in-sourcing and FX each contributed to $1 million increases. But we did begin to see approximately $1 million in savings from crew start reductions and continue to believe our overall headcount will be down for the year as we continue to make progress with PSR, particularly once our new transportation service plan is finalized.","Turning to Slide 21. Fuel expense increased $2 million due to increasing fuel prices in Mexico. As you can see in the bar chart, Mexican fuel prices have continued to increase from $2.86 a year-ago to $3.15 in 2Q, a 10% increase. Offsetting those increases, we achieved efficiency gains by moving about the same GTMs this quarter as we did in 2Q 2018, but using 3% fewer gallons, an indicator of technology improvements and running more fuel-efficient trains.","Finally on Slide 22, let me briefly discuss our capital allocation priorities. As our free cash flow continues to grow, we will have a nice problem. A significant buildup in cash enough to continue to invest in our business and return more capital to shareholders. Our top priority is to continue to invest in our business to generate better revenue growth.","However, we are reducing our 2019 capital expenditure guidance from $640 million to $660 million to less than $600 million. This reduction is due to two factors. First, our PSR effort to freed up capacity on our network as fluidity improves. And second, we're adjusting our capital program to the realities of less than expected volume growth. We\u2019ve reduced investments in various growth and capacity projects until the volume environment is more predictable and we have finalized our transportation service plans.","That said, we will continue to invest in our cross-border capacity to stay ahead of the double-digit growth we've seen in the last 18 months. As for shareholder returns, we continue to buy shares under the $800 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board in August of 2017. During the quarter, we repurchased 773,000 shares for a total of $92 million and are pacing ahead of a pro rata schedule to repurchase our shares under the authorized program. In light of this acceleration, Management plans to review our capital allocation strategy with our Board of Directors before the end of the year.","And with that, I will turn it back to Pat.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thanks, Mike. I will just touch on a couple of things and restate a few things for emphasis before we open it up for Q&A. We feel really good about the progress we're making. Obviously, we'd like to see a more robust volume environment that as Mike explained, 60% to 80% of our portfolio we still see as favorable. And with the exception of intermodal, we still see good growth opportunities in the quarters ahead and the -- what we -- what I refer to as the oversized growth areas that we talk about a lot. Automotive, refined products moving into Mexico and plastics coming out of the Gulf Coast. So those businesses still look very solid. They\u2019re producing both volume and revenue growth and in spite of overall flat volumes we're still seeing good revenue growth and sticking with our volume revenue guidance from earlier this year.","Mike also mentioned our cross-border product continues to grow double digits in both volume and revenue and we feel there's lots of opportunity for that to continue. We are producing and delivering core operational improvements, which are driving improved service levels, better asset utilization and increased profitability and cash flow. We are handling the same volume levels overall that we have of last year with 12% fewer locomotives, 7% fewer railcars and 10% fewer crew starts. And we think there's more to come in the months and quarters ahead as Sameh and Jeff both mentioned, we're just beginning to completely restructure and whiteboard our transportation service plan, which we are confident will lead to further asset savings and cost savings and service improvements in the months and quarters ahead.","We are taking our PSR related operational savings up by more than 2.5x in terms of impact to 2019 and beyond. And we will continue to update investors as we get further into this and particularly in the third and fourth quarter when we see the results and the benefits of our TSP whiteboarding exercise.","And we still feel very good generally about our overall portfolio and I will just restate 60% to 80% neutral or favorable, a few outliers that are having a bigger impact on volumes than they are on revenues, reducing our CapEx accordingly, improving free cash flow. I think our free cash flow conversion rate is increasing as well. So, all in all, in spite of some troubling signals in the economy and still some unresolved trade issues, we feel really good about the progress we are making and still feel good about the outlook.","So with that, I will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.","Chris Wetherbee","Yes, hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning.","Chris Wetherbee","Maybe, Mike, can you start on Slide 17. I just want to make sure I understand sort of what the moving parts with the fuel tax credit this week and kind of get that out of the way. So in the second quarter I think you guys have been expecting an 80 basis point headwind that ended up coming in a bit bigger than that. Sort of the way that we\u2019re thinking about this now, the way that we should be looking at it going forward. So maybe if you could sort of parse what happened, the difference in the quarter between the 80 and 130? And then as we go forward in the context of the rest of the year and obviously the 2021 guidance, we should be assuming that include this 80 basis point ongoing headwind?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, exactly, Chris. The guidance assumes we are going to absorb this negative 80 basis point impact and we are going to be on the low end of the range. So you should view that as improvement driven by both of those items. And the 80 basis points is what we believe will be the impact going forward in each quarter. The reason it was a little higher in the first quarter or second quarter was really for two reasons. One, we have the timing issue of losing the credit on April 30 and not getting it on customer bills until mid May. And then, secondly, since we are not going to adjust this anymore, the -- in quarter benefit related to the IEPS credit that we did get is sitting down in income taxes. But that's exactly right. I think you got that right.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay.","Mike Upchurch","Chris, there is a -- the 80 basis points over time there is a part of our as Mike mentioned, a part of our customer base that pays and -- an all-in rate so between contract renewals we don't have specific fuel surcharge. So it'll take a while for us to catch up, if you will, and perhaps adjust those contracts to reflect that all-in rate versus rate plus fuel. So that 80 basis points could come down as those contracts are renewed. And it's also important, I think we\u2019ve mentioned this in other venues, we are challenging this decision. The loss of the IEPS tax credit applies to railroads only. So our truck competitors and other modes of competition did not have the same regulation and rule come down in their case. So we think it's discriminatory for us and we're challenging it and we certainly elevated this in our dialogue with government officials in Mexico, but certainly don't want to make any prediction about the outcome of that. But we're trying to defend ourselves here from a market competitiveness standpoint as well as our customers interests, and that will continue to do that.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. And ultimately there were very little impact in operating income. It looks like less than a $1 million a quarter going forward.","Pat Ottensmeyer","That\u2019s the point. Because you\u2019re increasing your revenue items and an expense item by roughly the same amount, it has a bigger impact on operating ratio. But when you really go down the income statement and think about the dollars and paces involved it's minimal.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay. And if I could ask a follow-up just on the capital structure. Mike you had some comments there. It couldn\u2019t help, but notice that CapEx guidance come down a little bit. Obviously, profitability with the OR improving, is going up. The leverage is sort of trickling towards the lower end of maybe where the peers are moving, so how should we think about sort of the capital structure as we go forward? It seems like a high-class problem to have that free cash flow generation is likely to step up as we move forward and we think about things like accelerated stock repurchases or anything else that might be thinking about from a capital structure perspective.","Mike Upchurch","Yes. Well, you got that exactly right. We\u2019ve a nice problem and we will continue to have nice problem. More and more cash flow generation as a result of the items that you indicated, obviously increasing cash from ops and lower CapEx, we are going to create a better dynamic for us going forward. Obviously, this is a decision we will have to reach with our Board and I did indicate we would be meeting with the Board specifically on our capital allocation policy before the end of the year. So stay tuned. We don\u2019t have any news today, but we will soon.","Chris Wetherbee","Okay, perfect. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Thank you, Chris.","Operator","The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning.","Amit Mehrotra","Mike, I\u2019m not going to ask you about the excise tax credits, so you\u2019re welcome.","Mike Upchurch","Thanks, Amit.","Amit Mehrotra","But I did want to ask about the revenue growth guidance being left intact despite the lower volume outlook. Obviously, it implies a uptick in yields in the back half compared to the first half, which typically isn't the case if you look at prior years. So if you could just help us think about the underlying assumptions there, discuss a little bit more comfortable with the assumed deceleration?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, sure. We had indicated in or Pat has indicated kind of volume being flat to slightly down. If you look at our results through the first half of the year, we were down roughly a point. A lot of that related to first quarter, teacher strikes, but obviously we are not -- we certainly hope won't happen in the back half of the year, so flat to slightly down. And then I think you need to think about mix. Obviously, the intermodal business is a little bit challenging in today's environment. So with a lower revenue per unit you can read into that. We\u2019ve got a little bit softer outlook on intermodal in the back half of the year, but offset by refined product which has a very good length of haul and what we think will be good grain volumes going forward.","Amit Mehrotra","Right. So it's not -- it's really the mix of volume as oppose to any assumed acceleration in pricing? Is that the way to think about it?","Mike Upchurch","Correct.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. And then let me just -- for my follow-up, I just wanted to ask about the different buckets of the cost structure. Are we going to see a more sizable reduction in the workforce. It's by far the biggest piece of the cost structure. I would just imagine the structural improvements you are making could translate to great opportunity for labor productivity whether that means proactive reductions in workforce or maybe a limited need to replace those who leave to attrition on your attritions a little bit, may be high single digits every year. So can you just talk about that and when, if at all more step function increases labor productivity are going to be part of this plan going forward?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I'll provide some initial comments here and then maybe ask Sameh and Jeff to provide little more detail, but -- I will state the obvious the best of all possible outcomes is that we improved labor productivity and then we see growth opportunities come into create demand for those services, those assets, those people. But we don't necessarily have complete control over the rate of growth that we\u2019re seeing. Yes, I think obviously the things we're doing in terms of fewer train starts, redesigning the network, I said this before in previous quarters, we\u2019re getting out of our own way. We are removing congestion, we're running a more fluid and efficient railroad and that's going to result in fewer. At the same volume levels, that's going to result in the need for fewer locomotives, railcars and crews and then have a further ripple effect in terms of mechanical assets engineering possibly as well. So in a flat volume environment the things we're doing should result in further productivity improvements and possibly lower headcount requirements going forward. We also have and we\u2019ve talked about this for a long time. We have work rules in Mexico that are not lined up with the way things work in the U.S and we think there are some opportunities for gains there as well. The mantra of our PSR efforts as some of you know is service begets growth. So we're hoping that by doing all of these things and improving the way we run our railroad producing a more consistent reliable and resilient network that we are able to take better advantage of some of the growth opportunities that we see and we can put all those assets to use. But if that growth doesn't occur quickly, then we will see further headcount and labor productivity savings. Now, Jeff or Sameh, have anything to add to that.","Sameh Fahmy","I will just add and then I will let Jeff expand on it. Jeff is spending a lot more time on this on the labor relation front. But in general, by reducing train delays, which we have been putting a lot of emphasis on and that's how we have been achieving a lot of -- the velocity improvement, it clearly have reduced or improves as an example. By reducing train starts, well again, you have a need for less crews because you have fewer trains. By reducing switching in yards and enforcing compliance at least with existing plan to begin with and hopefully with the new plan, the new service plan, train design and yard design, we should reduce switching even more. Well, by definition, while going to need also less crews in yards. So you look at all these and then add to it the mechanical side where we have taken the worst locomotive result of the fleet that had 8 failures per year and 10 failures per year when decent good locomotives have about 2 failures per year. There is a significant reduction in the workload in shops. So you add all that together, you achieve a lot of staff reduction. Now on the mechanical side, we have gone and done a lot of these staff reductions. Some of that has been offset by some of the in-sourcing activities because labor in shops makes a lot more sense to be a reporting to the company, not reporting to a vendor and as a result we have had significant savings in money on that. So, yes, the comp can go up, but the money I think one shop alone was $4 million less per year in expense. We also went ahead and close one shop in Monterey. So in-source San Luis Potosi, but we close Monterey. So, in the mechanical side we have taken the actions. On the transportation side because of the work rules that Pat mentioned we cannot just arbitrarily go and take action. We still have four men crews in many places, in many situations and we have to work on that was our colleagues from the union and I think Jeff you can expand on that.","Jeff Songer","Yes, I will just add a couple more talking points. The tale of two countries a bit. In the U.S., we\u2019ve actually added some crews as part of our efforts. And Sameh talked about Houston, that's -- again that\u2019s just -- it is more fluid today, but it remains a difficult spot. It's our highest re-crew area of our network. And so, we\u2019ve said it's better to have a little excess resource there and maintain and improve the fluidity versus trying to manage too tight. Cross-border, we\u2019ve talked about we\u2019ve added several crews in the Laredo and with international crews. On the flipside, in Mexico we do have opportunities. We\u2019ve talked in the past about still having three and four person train crews. Those are collective agreements. We're actively working on. However, that's just progressing little slower than we would like. Keep in mind though that the crews while we don't have furlough ability similar to U.S., if the crews are running trains as we talked about crew starts, they\u2019re collecting just minor benefit from a dollar perspective. I know Mike mentioned, we've had about a $1 million to kind of efficiencies with what the train start reduction. So not 100% focused on the headcount for Mexico because of those cost factors, but still something we are going to continue to work on through the rest of the year. We believe there's opportunity and hopefully we get some work completed with the Mexico Union. If not, that will just proceed a little slower as you mentioned to attrition.","Amit Mehrotra","Okay. I appreciate the comprehensive answer. Thanks everybody.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Long of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Justin Long","Thanks and good morning.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Good morning.","Justin Long","So just to clarify on the 2021 OR target, does that just include the $55 million of PSR OpEx savings since you spoke about or some number that\u2019s higher than that based on other initiatives you have in the pipeline? And then, Mike, also on the PSR savings, could you talk about what you recognized in first and second quarter as we think about what's incremental in the back half to get you to that $40 million number?","Mike Upchurch","Well, let me start with, I guess, your second question on PSR savings. You know, the amounts that we disclosed here on page 18 are recorded throughout the course of the year. So we now expect $40 million to be the savings as a result of PSR actions, but that would go up each quarter as you\u2019re getting full benefit for those initial reductions that we identified. So I don't know if that entirely answered your question, the $40 million is kind of a buildup throughout the rest of the year and the exit rate will be higher, which will lead us to $65 million of annual expense savings in 2020. With respect to your other question, we clearly have a view today of having better expense savings as a result of our first six months of PSR activities, that's why we moved to the lower end of the guidance that we had set for 2021. And remember, not only did we move to the lower end of the guidance, but we're also going to absorb the 80 basis point negative impacts from the loss of the fuel tax credit. So, obviously, where we\u2019re at in PSR savings today did factor into us improving our outlook out into 2021.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Just to add to that there are lots of moving pieces to operating ratio, including revenue and volume growth, incremental margins, pricing etcetera. And then there are other things that we\u2019ve talked about just recently here and in the presentation about the PSP whiteboarding, we fully expect that that's going to produce another -- possible another wave of improvement here and then some of the labor issues that Jeff and Sameh talked about. We -- I will say, we don\u2019t have all of that because we\u2019re at the beginning stages of some of that into our guidance. So, we will update guidance as we get better clarity and better information on some of these initiatives, but I don't -- I will state it for you, you didn\u2019t see it this way, Justin, so bear with me here a little bit. We certainly haven't declared victory on this at this point. We still feel like we're fairly early on and have room to improve further.","Justin Long","Okay, That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly I wanted to ask about intermodal. Clearly, this is an area where we\u2019ve seen a bit more pressure recently, but when do you think intermodal volumes can start to inflect positively and do you need the truckload market to improve in order for that to happen or can you see intermodal growth from company specific areas, even in a looser truckload capacity environment?","Mike Naatz","I think that we can certainly pursue growth opportunities and we are doing that. For example the cross-border intermodal traffic continues to grow despite overall pressure on the U.S domestic marketplace. I do think though with respect to the U.S domestic marketplace we\u2019re going to need truck capacity to tighten up in order to improve that situation.","Justin Long","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Samantha Yellen","Hi. This is Sam Yellen on for Allison Landry. Thanks for taking my question. As you just said, we\u2019ve been seeing some softening in the U.S trucking market. I was wondering if you could talk about the Mexican truckload market a little. Have you been seeing some more softening in Mexico? And has that been a drag on Intermodal volumes as well? Thank you.","Mike Naatz","So actually we indicated that we saw improvements in our Lazaro intermodal business. It doesn't seem to be experiencing quite the same challenges that we're experiencing on the U.S domestic side of the marketplace. We have a little bit of a disadvantage because of the discriminatory pricing actions resulting from the fuel situation. So we will have to address that over time as we look at our contracts in our volume requirements.","Pat Ottensmeyer","I will just add to that and what Mike said earlier about the U.S domestic versus other segments of our market. In our appendix and background information to our presentation we do call out the cross-border in Lazaro intermodal volumes and revenue, so you can see we are seeing growth in those markets. And the area that we\u2019re seeing the most weakness, which is a big part of our intermodal business, but certainly not all of it is the U.S domestic.","Allison Landry","Thanks. And then also can you give us an update on your initiatives in the Houston area, specifically are you seeing incremental progress in this area and what you view as the biggest risk to reconfiguring traffic flows?","Sameh Fahmy","I can comment on that. This is Sameh. We have definitely made some operational adjustments to the Houston area. We changed from a method, if you like, of staging trains ahead of that area to try to avoid congestion and all that, a new method where we actually push our trains frankly through it. And also not worry too much about some of the -- it's difficult to explain on a call, but some of usage of sidings to park trains, which end up using the sidings for parking instead of train meets. The other thing we did is that we also stopped using detours, which were costing us a lot of money but also losing a bit of control on the transit time, time of a train. A combination of these things have really provided a lot more consistency in the transit time in that area. We see 12 miles, 13 miles per hour for that area when we use to see about 7 or 8 miles per hour. And it's happening now. Whether there is a peak of volume or reduction in volume, we're getting consistency and that's really important. And the other nice thing happening now after we did an exercise was our colleagues from UP for 2.5 days around-the-clock watching exactly what\u2019s happening in that area is that not only we change our own method at KCS of avoiding that staging. I\u2019m trying to predict and forecast on all that, but also the transit time itself in the area has improved because of much better dispatching and we see it in the amount of recruits that we endure. We have a lot of trains now that goes through the whole area without any recruits. So you can get through that 120 mile very important area between Beaumont and Kendleton in six hours which is very good. It used to be some times 15 and 18 hours. So I think we got this one pretty much under control and now we\u2019re focusing as I said on my slide on the border and we are focusing on yards. These are the next two big areas where we believe we can make a breakthrough and improve our velocity and our dwell and all the other things.","Allison Landry","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you, I guess, a bit about some of the yard work and whiteboarding. What\u2019s the -- I guess, you didn\u2019t talk about the Monterrey yard, I think that\u2019s something in the past that that has been mentioned as a point of congestion. Maybe just where you add in terms of how the yards are functioning? Are they kind of cleaned up from the initial work which you\u2019ve done? And primarily what you\u2019re going to look for going forward as a reduction in train starts. How do we think about the, I guess, what you're aiming for in whiteboarding and what the result maybe on the Mexico operations?","Sameh Fahmy","Let me start and then I will -- Jeff, maybe you can continue here. I think there are two things when we think about yards. There is the inventory of the yard and I believe that's what you're referring to when you\u2019re talking about Monterrey and that is an inventory that was a 1,000 cars higher back in December than it is today. And a lot of effort has been taken on that, trying to look at cars that that sit for a long time and trying to understand why they sit and working also with customers because a lot of these -- a lot of tracks in the yard are often used for what we call constructive placement which means the car is ready to go the customer, but the customer is not ready to take it. So we have been working a lot with our key customers in the Monterrey area in a very positive and partnership way and it has brought great fruit. That's one side when we talk about the yard. The other one is more of the operation and the arrival of trains and the departure of trains and the switching in the yard. And when I talk about San Luis Potosi and a week we spend there, walking in the yard and sitting in the tower and talking to people, okay? Talking to people tells you much more than anything you can read in annual report. They tell you exactly what the issues are and what the solutions are. When you look at the yard you find that, well, there was a train held up on the north side, there was a train held on the south side, because some trains came in close to each other not according to plan, but they came close to each other because of train delays. Then you also find that there is a train working in the yard meaning setting out a block and picking up a block, that was not even supposed to work in yard. That's what I talk about when I say compliance with plan, same that go out of plan because another yard on its own initiative decided to add some cars to a train, but now you have to work on that same train like it was added in Sanchez, an example I gave. Now in San Luis Potosi, you have to take some of these cars out, okay? And that was not in the plan. So you kind of blocked the movement in the yard, the configurations of these yards sometimes does not make things easy for the work in the yard and blocks through trains as an example. And that's where that compliance becomes important. Even with the existing plan and making sure also that train arrive when they\u2019re suppose to arrive and not bunched up. And then in the new plan, the new design, the new whiteboarding, then you work on trying to avoid the work itself in the first place, like get smart about where you do the blocking and of the cars for their destinations and try to do that blocking as deep down in the network as you can at origin. And this way you don\u2019t switch the car and then switch it again and then switch it again in three different yards but you try to reduce that amount of work. And when you reduce that amount of work, that\u2019s how create capacity without spending any money, because you don\u2019t have to reconfigure the yards now, okay? And you may even change the mission of some yards. We looked at San Luis Potosi, there is a nice inter-portal yard for intermodal, which is not far from it. And it's a great field, you can build very long tracks without any problem. While the old San Luis Potosi yard is constrained in the middle of a city, it's a very old yard. So trying when you get a long train in a yard like that, you have to do what we call doubling it, like split it in two tracks and on the departure you have to combine it again. You go in a new yard like inter-portal and you can build a long track. I think I gave you a very large explanation, but I think we are passionate about this exercise.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, that -- I mean, that\u2019s great. I guess for the follow-up, it sounds like there -- maybe two different -- a lot of opportunities where one of them is compliance and then one of them is the plan. What is it that -- what are you doing to really drive the cultural change and the compliance? And then just in terms of the way you implement after the whiteboarding, is this a design across all the terminals in Mexico? Do you kind of flip the switch in fourth quarter or do you go terminal by -- yard by yard and do things one yard at a time? Thanks.","Jeff Songer","Yes, this is Jeff. I will just expand on that. You got it right on. So I\u2019m looking at this kind of two phase. First phase we\u2019ve seen some good work is simply compliance. And compliance to current TSP, as Sameh mentioned in Monterrey yard, that been on the one big differences that we\u2019ve had and just execution, increased focus, increased focus on a daily basis through Brian's team and the use of additional data and dashboards and tactical kind of business process folks really sitting in and dissecting the day-to-day operation of the yard, that's all added benefit as well as working with customers, rightsizing fleets. Sameh mentioned CT car, so I think that's really the bulk of the work that\u2019s going on thus far is more that day-to-day tactical accountability and execution. As we look forward, again we\u2019ve talked about a lot of the PSR opportunities with TSP is in Mexico because of our -- I will say overly complex intermodal manifest product that\u2019s just how we operate down there. So looking at the yards and the handlings, reducing handlings, simplifying those products for improved fluidity, but also better product offering for our customers is really kind of the next second half of the year, I really think that's really what we're going to get to more long-term and structural changes to our TSP.","Tom Wadewitz","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay.","Brian Ossenbeck","Pat, I want to ask you more about the service. That was your mantra and you're expecting to see some growth here maybe in the second half of the year and in places like grain where service starts to improve. We can see that in your metrics, but whereas the ones that we still don\u2019t see externally is some sort of up service besides being dwell. So can you tell us about how you\u2019re viewing that internally which you\u2019re talking to with the customers, do you have a plan to roll out a plan compliance or something along those lines?","Pat Ottensmeyer","Yes. We have a number of different metrics that we look at as far as customer service and customer satisfaction, I feel like from the moment that we actually started and announced our PSR initiative and started to work with customers, we saw almost from day one improvement in a lot of our key customer metrics. And the feedback we\u2019re getting from customers and I will go back in a minute to talk about why kind of picking up on some of the couple, the previous questions about how we are going about this in a really cross functional way, even as we redesign the TSP, which we just talked about the engagement of the sales and marketing team, the communication with customers, all of those things, we\u2019re trying to do this in a really thoughtful and cross functional way, so that we can get the full benefit of the changes we're making and making sure that our customers are very well aware and informed before we make certain changes so that they can make adjustments not only make adjustments to their supply chain strategies and execution, but they become aware of improvements, capacity, availability. Best example is grain. One of the reasons we think that we\u2019re going to see some improvement in our grain and Ag\/Min business is improving cycle times has allowed us to do the same amount of volume with certain customers with fewer assets. Our first choice when we look at the consequence of that is not to immediately go cut up cars and go to the scrap yard is to say can we fill that capacity with additional volume and go out and try to sell that capacity, take advantage of our improved performance and shorten cycle times. And as you can expect, it's not like customers immediately have sales on the shelf ready to go, so it takes a while for that cycle to be completed. In other words, customers are going to want to see that these improvements in cycle times and operational metrics is sustainable for some period of time before they go out and put their neck on the line and sell that capacity to their customers. But that's always the first choice. And I think we talk about this with a number of you, one of the barometers that I look at, it's kind of a high-level metric, but it's not terribly sophisticated that the number of unit grain shuttles that we're able to run across our network and for me that gives me an indication of the health and fluidity of our entire network because a lot of those shuttles run from Eastern Illinois or Kansas City, all the way down into the heart of Mexico. So there are five or six different traps. We run into trouble around Shreveport, they get trapped. We run in trouble around Houston or at the bridge or at Monterey yard even though these trains aren't being handled in Monterey. So there are a number of different traps. But when we look at the total number of grain trains that we're able to run in any given month or whatever period you choose, that\u2019s just sort of an indication of the total overall health of our entire network and in the last couple of months we\u2019ve had record levels of performance even to some extent that have been affected by the flooding at the points of origin in Illinois and Missouri. So for example, we ran 42 grain shuttles in the month of May and that freed up a lot of capacity. So our first question we ask ourselves when we do that is can we take that capacity? Can we take those cars, crews and locomotive and sell them and fill it up? So now I\u2019m probably wandered away from your core question, but that that\u2019s kind of an indication of how we\u2019re thinking about taking advantage of the benefits that we're producing here and getting back to that service and growth orientation.","Brian Ossenbeck","All right. That\u2019s great. Thanks, Pat. I appreciate the comprehensive response there.","Pat Ottensmeyer","We got way too comprehensive answers here so \u2026","Brian Ossenbeck","That was a good one. I appreciate it. The shorter question follow-up for Mike and Mike, we\u2019ve seen volumes come down from 3% to 4% to flat to possibly down, but the revenue guidance stayed the same. I can understand the mixed shift and some of that accelerating in the back half of the year, but as I look at the change in IEPS and more revenue, fuel surcharge revenue going from the top line, it looks might -- that might be 2 percentage points. I don\u2019t know if you could help put some context around there. How much of revenue guide staying the same is really from the mix shift which we\u2019ve seen through the first half of the year and how much from the change and how fuel surcharge is being pushed through the geography of the financial statement? Thank you.","Mike Naatz","So I think revenue is going to be driven by changes in core pricing. Changes in fuel related expenses and then, of course, changes in volume. With respect to the volume, one other things to keep in mind is that the intermodal volume is disproportionate compared to the revenue. So for example, if I were looking at my volume numbers, you might see that 45% of our volumes are related to intermodal business but only 15% of our revenues are related to intermodal business. So there's a very disproportionate impact on volume and revenue. And I think that's what you're seeing the revenue continues to be higher even though we decreased our overall volume forecast. Does that help?","Brian Ossenbeck","Yes, and just maybe to clarify, the fuel surcharge in the slide that Mike Upchurch had about how that impacts the top line. I don\u2019t know if that was another kind of factor to consider here?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, that\u2019s what we try to do with the last column on slide 17 is to give you an estimate of what the future quarters might look like. Obviously, we're not talking about what the quarterly total revenues are, so I\u2019m going to stay away from percentages, but I\u2019m sure you can do those calculations with your model, we are kind of looking at that $12.8 million.","Brian Ossenbeck","Okay. Thanks. That helps. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Ken Hoexter","Hey, great. Good morning and solid job on the improving PSR results. Great to see. Just on -- Mike, maybe on the $51 million charge, maybe you can kind of delve into that, talk to us what that\u2019s for, given that you had a two quarters in a row now. You mentioned they may continue -- this is, I guess, not really typical for rails adopting PSR to take such charges, but I know historically you\u2019ve been a little different given your leases and some of the things you\u2019ve been trapped in. So maybe talk about what that generates for you and what that\u2019s contributing from?","Mike Upchurch","Yes, Ken, the charge in the second quarter was predominantly related to locomotives and freight cars that we no longer need in our business, so we will be disposing those either selling or scrapping those. I don't think the fact that we\u2019ve taken two charges is unusual. And I think there could be another one coming, sometime in the third or fourth quarter. We will continue to make decisions about equipment. We will continue to be making decisions about number of resources we need to move trains as we go through the train consolidation and the service plan redesign.","Ken Hoexter","I guess just trying to clarify that others have kind of just parked locomotives, is this getting rid of leases that you\u2019ve had or is -- I just want to understand what the charge as opposed to just parking appointment [ph]?","Mike Upchurch","It's writing off the net book value of the equipment that we're no longer going to need.","Pat Ottensmeyer","And I think the sequence that we've gone through, Ken, in the case locomotives, again we take an action, we reduce train starts, we do something that we think is going to free up capacity and reduce congestion. We parked the assets for a period of time and then once we sort of become convinced that change is going to stick, we sell them, scrap them, get rid of them, they\u2019re gone. And we've sold quite a few of the locomotives and the impairment charge I think relates to those assets that we have maybe gone through that cycle of parking for a while and then conclude that they\u2019re no longer necessary and actually get rid of them.","Ken Hoexter","Okay. I don\u2019t know I would presume that helps your DNA through there. Just a follow-up on the train length, I guess, Sameh, you talked about maybe lengthening train, target of 6,000 feet, is there something you need to invest more on sidings in Mexico or the U.S side? Is that something that that's your goal because that's what your network is designed for, maybe talk about the potential that\u2019s increased that train length size?","Sameh Fahmy","From a -- Ken, from a siding lengths, we are okay, but we still have a lot of very short trains in Mexico. In the U.S the train lengths is very decent. Grain trains, coal trains, manifest trains are very nice and quite long and the tonnage is heavy, which is the way you want it to be. In Mexico, we have some very, very short trains and we see them every day, particularly at the endpoints of the network like Lazaro and Toluca and some of these locations because the way our structure of trains is, we drop-off a lot of blocks until we get to the endpoint and then if the train becomes short. And then when it departs in the opposite direction, it starts short and then it picks up a lot of traffic. So in the new design we are going to look at this to see how can we increase the length even at the endpoints of the network. So it's more of a design issue, Ken, than a sidings issue.","Mike Naatz","Ken, I would add just a little color. Our infrastructure is in good shape for that. I think as we started this process 6,000 was the target. And as we get into more of the TSP definition and redesign and whiteboarding as Sameh mentioned here in the second half of the year, I think your targets for next year will be above that. So I think that was the starting point for us to say, here is opportunities we see in these commodities, I will say it again with Mexico intermodal manifest products. We know we have opportunity. As we get through the whiteboard exercise I'll be very surprised if we don't have more opportunities than that, but the infrastructure we have is fine to handle that.","Ken Hoexter","Wonderful. I appreciate the time. I feel like I\u2019m giving you guys short answers. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe research. Please go ahead.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Almost good afternoon. The guide -- the long-term guide sort of implies around a 150 basis points on margin improvement a year. Do you think we get that in the second half, Mike or is the fuel headwinds sort of too much to overcome? And if we don't get that for 150 for '19, do we have visibility at this point to over 150 for next year?","Mike Upchurch","Well, I think if you're asking can the back half of 2019 be better than the first half? Yes, we think so. With respect to our longer term guidance, you can kind of do the math getting into low 60s. Yes, the 80 basis point headwind on the IEPS and then you can do the math on what that requires on an annual basis, but if you think about what we've done through normal operation this year in the first six months, we are about a 160 basis points better than a year-ago.","Scott Group","Let me ask this differently. And is it fair that we are changing the guide just six months in that we wouldn't be sort of improving the OR guidance if it was going to be about a 2021 step function. We got to have some confidence about more of a step function coming sooner than later, is that fair, Mike?","Mike Upchurch","Well, we wouldn\u2019t put the guidance out if we didn\u2019t have some confidence in that. I maybe take you back to our January discussion around how we set this. We were barely a month into the process and so shouldn\u2019t be very surprising that we are seeing bigger and bigger savings opportunities as we move through this. But we do still have things like PTC headwinds that we're trying to overcome in 2019 that won't be there in 2020 and 2021. So all along, our guidance had been the first year improvement may not be as good as the second and third year improvement.","Scott Group","Okay, makes sense to me. Just real quick. I see, Sameh, you've got a slide, we\u2019ve taken 7% of the cars out, we\u2019ve line of sight to another 3%. The locos you've taken 12% out, what do you have line of sight to there for incremental locos?","Sameh Fahmy","The -- it will depend a lot on the revenue. I mean we -- like Pat mentioned a number of times, we are hoping that the improved service, which is palpable and our customer are telling us that they see the improvement in service, that will generate more business. As a matter of fact, I think on the commercial call, Mike, this week or last week we won back the customer. The customer came back to us because of improved service. So if we improve service that will have an impact on how many -- how we will size our assets. Like Pat said, we would love to keep the remaining assets that we have and use some for absorbing more revenue.","Pat Ottensmeyer","As you know, it's easier to get line of sight on cars because that tends to relate to specific customers or commodities or aspects of our business. Locomotives reduced across the entire franchising and entire portfolio, so that's why we're being a little more cautious about guiding to any further locomotive reductions.","Sameh Fahmy","And on the car side, we still have a lot of system intermodal cars that we have in storage. I mean, we would love to get more business and use them for that.","Scott Group","Okay. Thanks for the time, guys.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Bascome Majors","Yes, thanks. You talked a little bit about attrition earlier. I don't think you gave an attrition rate for the business right now. Can you talk about the kind of inherent attrition rate in the U.S and Mexico and where it's tracking today?","Mike Upchurch","It's kind of 6%, 7% normal attrition.","Bascome Majors","Is that the same on both sides of the border?","Mike Upchurch","That I don't know. I just know overall.","Bascome Majors","All right. And on CapEx, Mike you talked about 18% of revenues feeling like the right level when we get beyond this year. Historically, you've done a lot of chunky coinvestment projects to grow the business with some of your customers. Would that include those kinds of projects? And regardless of that answer, do you have a line of sight into anything like that coming up next year or the year after? Thank you.","Mike Naatz","Yes, sitting here today, we don't have big projects like the Sasol if that's what you're referring to. If those opportunities come our way, we will take a look at them and see whether it makes sense to invest. But no, there's nothing of that scale built into the 2020, 2021 CapEx to revenue guidance that we've provided.","Bascome Majors","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.","David Zazula","Good morning. This is David Zazula on for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe for Mike, you guys had an interchange partner go on media yesterday ordering passage of the USMCA. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit on how you think the potential added foreign investment might impact flows on the railroad and how that could affect your operational and capital planning?","Pat Ottensmeyer","I will take that, and -- yes, we are very much in support of USMCA. It's something that's very important to our company, our customers, our communities. And I've been quite vocal in both Washington and Mexico City supporting the passage of that trade agreement. In spite of the uncertainty of USMCA and for the last couple of years, look back over the last several quarters, we've seen just exceptional growth in our cross-border volumes. We do feel that the cloud of uncertainty has curtailed investments even though some of the data that\u2019s published about direct foreign investment in Mexico continues to increase. We think that there are investments that maybe companies have been considering that they've held off or delayed because of concern about the passage of the trade agreement. I've gotten out of the business of predicting what Congress will do a long time ago, feel like there is no reason that this trade agreements should not be approved. It's certainly better than NAFTA and it's way better than no trade agreement and we will continue to be involved in trying to influence the outcome in the direction of the debate and hope to have some resolution on that in the next, probably not until after the recess in the U.S. Congress, but hopefully by the end of the year.","David Zazula","Great. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Pat Ottensmeyer for closing remarks.","Pat Ottensmeyer","Okay. Well we will -- I will wrap up very quickly. Thank you for your time and attention and when we do our next shareholder and investor survey, please give us high marks for comprehensiveness of answers. Thank you very much and we will be back with you in 90 days.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."]}}
