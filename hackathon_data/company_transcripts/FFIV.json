If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Eldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Eldridge","Thank you, Wanda and welcome all of you on the line to our earnings conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. Manny Rivelo, President and CEO and Andy Reinland, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer will be the principal speakers on today\u2019s call. Kristen Dimlow, our new EVP of Human Resources and the other members of our executive team are also on hand to answer questions following these prepared remarks.","If you have any follow-up questions after the call, please direct them to me at 206-272-6571. A copy of today\u2019s press release is available on our website at f5.com. In addition, you can access an archived version of today\u2019s live webcast from the Events Calendar page of our website through October 28 from 4:30 p.m. today until midnight Pacific Time, July 23. You can also listen to a telephone replay at 800-879-6771 or 402-220-5335.","During today\u2019s call, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements, which include words such as believe, anticipate, expect and target. These forward-looking statements involve uncertainties and risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in our quarterly release described in detail in our SEC filings. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.","And now, I will turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, F5 delivered solid results that reflect growing demand for our expanding array of products and services. As more large organizations deploy hybrid architectures, we continue to see momentum in sales of our software offerings, both as modules on our purpose-built hardware and the standalone virtual editions. During Q3, we also saw the beginning of what we believe will be a steady ramp in sales of our subscription-based Silverline services. These trends, combined with the ongoing success of our Good, Better, Best sales motion, demand for our security products and continued traction with our key partners, all contributed to the quarter\u2019s positive results.","Revenue of $483.6 million grew 2% from the prior quarter and 10% year-over-year and was at the high end of our $475 million to $485 million guided range. GAAP EPS of $1.29 per share was above our guidance of $1.16 to $1.19 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.67 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.57 to $1.60 per share. The strength in EPS was driven by our solid revenue and operating margin results and lower-than-expected tax rate during the quarter.","Product revenue of $248.8 million, up 2% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, represented 51% of total revenue. Service revenue of $234.8 million increased 3% sequentially, 15% year-over-year and accounted for 49% of total revenue. The Americas accounted for 58% of revenue during the quarter; EMEA contributed 24%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 4%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas revenue grew 13%; EMEA revenue grew 14%. Conversely, APAC revenue declined 6% and Japan revenue was down 2%. Enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 14%, including 6% of total sales from U.S. federal.","In Q3, we have three greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 19.2%; Ingram Micro, which represented 16.7%; and Avnet representing 13.5%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.3%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.6%. GAAP operating expenses were $257.8 million at the low end of our guided range of $257 million to $266 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $224.3 million. GAAP operating margin was 29%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 33.9%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.5%.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was $172.5 million. In Q3, we repurchased just over 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.92 for a total of $150 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.16 billion in cash and investments. Approximately, $624 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program. DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $30 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $742.5 million. We ended the quarter with 4,110 employees, an increase of 75 from the prior quarter.","Now, for the outlook, building on another quarter of solid momentum with our key drivers, we believe we will continue to see strong year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. Our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 is $500 million to $510 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range. This includes approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $267 million to $276 million. This includes approximately $38.5 million in stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. The stock-based compensation guidance reflects a one-time approximately $5 million increase as a result of the CEO transition as outlined in our 8-K filed April 22.","For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Reflecting the increased stock-based compensation expense, our GAAP EPS target is $1.26 to $1.29 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.72 to $1.75 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by at least 125 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $185 million.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Manny Rivelo.","Manny Rivelo","Thank you, Andy. I would like to thank everybody for joining F5\u2019s 2015 Q3 earnings conference call. Overall, I am pleased with our performance in Q3 as reflected by a record revenue and profitability. Among the notable signs of our progress this past quarter, we significantly grew our software revenue with the uptake of our Good, Better, Best packaging driving million-dollar plus deals. Moreover, our standalone software module attach rates were solid, especially the security modules. We saw major deals from service providers in the areas of Gi LAN service consolidation, security, network function virtualization. And we are excited about the progress we saw on our Silverline anti- DDoS subscription service, plus the recently launched Silverline Web application firewall has opened up new use cases for our customers.","From a regional perspective, we had a strong quarter in the Americas with bookings ahead of our internal expectations. In EMEA, we saw bookings growth rebound of a slower Q2 performance with particular strength in Northern Europe. Bookings in our Asia-Pac and Japan regions were slightly down year-over-year, in line with our expectations heading into the quarter.","Now let me drill down into the specifics of our major business drivers, which include core, security, service provider, professional services and our partner ecosystem. In our core business, we continue to help our customers leverage our Synthesis architecture to deliver their applications in the most efficient, secure and cost-effective manner. This includes optimizing their own datacenters, as well as leveraging both private and public clouds. Key to this is offering all of our products and software that can run on the major industry hypervisors are on top of our high performance hardware. Software is at the core of everything we do. Over the past 3 years, quarterly revenue from the sales of software modules and virtual editions has more than doubled, accounting for more than a third of our product revenue in Q3. The growth of our software only business is reflected in a recent industry analyst report, which reported that we grew 2.5 times faster than the general virtual ADC market, making us the market leader.","As more of our customers deploy hybrid solutions and adopt our good, better, best offerings, we believe this trend will continue. An example of a key customer win validating our hybrid application services strategy is a large hardware and software deal with an academic medical center that has standardized on F5. Leveraging our Access Policy Manager, specifically, the portal access, we are helping them drive down their total cost of ownership while creating the flexibility to move their applications between different cloud providers. In addition, we continue to see success with our platform refresh in the Cisco ACE replacement programs with many of our customers expanding their solutions to include our enhanced software modules. Lastly, our user community DevCentral grew nicely at 38% year-over-year with over 200,000 members, further demonstrating the value of our TMOS programmable architecture.","Our security modules remain a major growth driver for us. Given this past quarter\u2019s highly visible cyber security attacks, more customers from an increasing diverse pool are approaching F5 for our ability to secure applications, manage user policy and access, and mitigate application attacks across traditional datacenters and public and private clouds. As a result, we had a number of notable wins this quarter, including a branch of the U.S. government, a prestigious medical research group, both of whom needed to secure their organization\u2019s remote access capabilities. In addition, a multi-national defense contract to purchase our Access Policy Manager for single sign-on federation and three national carriers came to F5 for a variety of security solutions. Chief among them was our DNS security for mobile devices.","As you may recall, we also launched our Silverline DDoS mitigation service last November. In this past quarter, we launched our web application firewall service built on our industry leading Application Security Manager. We are seeing solid early adoption of these services. For example, a household name in retail that is an F5 customer added anti-DDoS Silverline protection in Q3 to their global web properties. Over the next several quarters, we plan to deliver additional Silverline services, including an upcoming iRule catalog that can be leveraged for various application solutions allowing zero day vulnerability protection. In addition, we will deliver hybrid on and off premise solutions that allow seamless inoperability between our Silverline SaaS offerings and BIG IP on-premise solutions.","In April, we opened a new Security Operations Center in Seattle. This gives us 7\/24 support to client helping mitigate web fraud, malware, phishing attempts and to combat DDoS and web application attacks through our Silverline services. On the service provider side, major carriers across the globe continue expanding their use cases with F5, driving down their costs and expanding their monetization strategies. In particular our solutions around Gi LAN service consideration, network function virtualization, Gi firewall and diameter routing are helping service providers manage mission critical service issues like traffic management, increase mobile application delivery and security.","In Q3, we signed our largest service provider security deal to-date, a multi-million dollar agreement with a domestic Tier 1 carrier. Meanwhile, a major operator in Asia-Pac leveraging two of our key ecosystem partners recently achieved ADC certification for the F5 NFV solution positioning our virtual editions as network functions. During Q3, our services business continues produced solid results with 15% year-over-year revenue growth. New and renewed service maintenance contracts drove 20% year-over-year of deferred revenue totaling $743 million, which ensures a positive revenue stream for quarters to come.","From a partner ecosystem perspective, we continue to see great momentum in our partnership with the likes of Amazon, Cisco, VMware and Microsoft. I can point to competitive SDN, cloud and VDI wins and media companies, technology companies and large U.S. retailers. We are confident that our current and future roadmaps position us well in helping our current customers and future prospects migrate their application services to software defined infrastructures.","In the meantime, as CEO I want to ensure that we are continually innovating, delivering best of breed products for our customers and expanding our addressable market. Key for our success is continuing to invest in the right people to help F5 reach the next level of growth. We have hired a new EVP of Human Resources. Kristen Dimlow has joined us from Microsoft and she will be focused on recruiting and retaining world class talent.","Another organizational change is the transition of the worldwide sales team to a new leader. After 11 years of service, with sales that ranked in the billions, Dave Feringa has decided to step down on October 1 to spend more time with his family on the East Coast. I want to thank Dave for all that he is built at F5, especially the strong global sales team and our lead position in the ADC market. We are actively looking for Dave\u2019s successor and plan to announce our decision shortly. As you heard from Andy, we have had a solid year thus far and look forward to a strong finish in Q4. We will continue to focus on ensuring that our customer\u2019s applications can run where they run best, our emphasis will be on driving top line growth, particularly for product revenue. I am excited about what the future holds. In Q4, we will launch our next version of BIG-IP, version 12.0. This release will help our customers navigate their application centric environment without compromising our security or operational efficiency.","With new features like modern pictographic cyber support, HTTP 2.0, single sign-on enhancement, hyper scale DNS and expanded SDN and cloud orchestration and management options, as well as early assets features for our next generation of iApp and iRules. We expect this release to open up over $500 million in additional addressable market. For insights to draw our longer term plans, I want to spend a few moments on our vision and strategy. We help organizations deliver the fastest, more secure and reliable applications to anyone, anywhere on any device. We are delivering on this vision through flexible scale up and scale out architectures that means we can provide our customers with consolidated set of application services on-premise in the cloud and as a service.","Moreover, we know that applications that become more prolific and dynamic, operational complexity has become the primary constraint holding organizations back. F5 is eliminating this complexity while simultaneously driving down the total cost of application ownership via centralized management, orchestration and analytics driven insights. We call this F5 Synthesis hybrid application services and is the cornerstone of our business and technology strategy. In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter and we look forward to a great Q4.","I will now open the call up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Sir you may ask your question.","Vijay Bhagavath","Thanks. Congratulations, Manny, it\u2019s a great trend. A question for you would be around the competition. Recently, we have heard in the news on Actavis taking a role in Citrix, are there any thoughts on the competitive dynamics playing versus Citrix NetScaler in the field, for example, would you look to proactively refresh NetScaler\u2019s Web 2.0 customers, that\u2019s the first part of the question? Thanks.","Manny Rivelo","Vijay thanks. I appreciate that kind of words. So yes, competition is something we look out very closely. As a matter of fact, just earlier this week, we did [Technical Difficulty] QVR and we review the competition every single quarter. The competitive trend haven't change significantly. I think you have seen over the last course of the last four to six quarters that we have been gaining market share in the market. We see that as going very well for us. And our traditional competitors we think are in a position that we know, not only how to compete against them, we have superior solutions. Yes, you will see us continue expand our programs, which we have aggressively focused on things like Cisco ACE replacement to also conclude the competition. So, we know that there is opportunity there. We are competing with them directly. We are also partnering with companies like VMware and tackling their VDI space. And you should expect to see more of that over the course of the next 90 days.","Vijay Bhagavath","Excellent. And a quick follow-on for Andy, yes, hi, Andy, this would be around cap return get this question a lot from clients, any thoughts on an accelerated buyback, any thoughts on M&A, where would you be looking into? Thanks.","Andy Reinland","Yes. So, on the buyback, that\u2019s something that we address every quarter with the board. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I think if you look at how we have performed on our buyback over the last couple of years, we are probably one of the most aggressive companies out there in terms of the percentage of buyback to our cash flow. So, the concept of an accelerated buyback or anything like that, that\u2019s something we may go with the board, discuss with the board, but nothing to announce about that right now. And then on M&A, we continue to look very actively. Anything that we believe can accelerate our roadmap we are going to look at very seriously and beyond that, really no change to the strategy.","Manny Rivelo","And the only thing I would add, Vijay, it\u2019s Manny, on the M&A side, it\u2019s something that we are very active on. We look at a lot of deals and we look at deals as Andy said to enhance our portfolio, consolidate services inside the portfolio from a roadmap perspective. So, we will continue to do that as we see fit. Obviously, the markets are little floppy right now, right, but to be slightly honest. But that doesn\u2019t mean that we will slow down our activity.","Vijay Bhagavath","Excellent. So, this is clearly a positive surprise. Thanks, again.","Manny Rivelo","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Alex Henderson for Needham. Sir, you may ask your question. Mr. Henderson, you might want to check your mute button please.","Manny Rivelo","Alex, you there? Let\u2019s move on.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Next question is from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Sir, you may ask your question.","Ittai Kidron","Thanks. Can you hear me?","Manny Rivelo","Yes, we can.","Ittai Kidron","Alright, it works. Congrats, Manny, on the first quarter as CEO on the public call. So, congrats, a great, great start for the quarter. I had a couple of questions. First of all, looking at your federal business, I went back for the last five years. In fact, I do remember a quarter where the June quarter was actually sequentially up from March. So, clearly, great result over there. But how do you make us feel comfortable that you weren\u2019t pulling from September the fiscal year end quarter into June, so you could give us some color on the U.S. Fed? That will be great. And then second to you, Andy, 75 employees hired, I think your target was north of 100. So, any color on why is it you are not able to get the people you want? Are they hard to find? Were you distracted? How do I think about that going forward?","Manny Rivelo","So, Ittai, it\u2019s Manny. Just on federal real quick, so we won\u2019t provide as you know guidance into future quarters, but what we see in federal is just a strong pipeline of business, right. There has been a lot of projects in the federal market space. I think we have been telegraphing that, but it\u2019s not for lack of visibility into the projects, it\u2019s in the past been more for lack of budget into that. So, we saw very strong quarter. We anticipate in typical fashion right with the federal as its largest quarter usually in our fiscal Q4. So, we don\u2019t anticipate that changing.","Andy Reinland","And then, yes, Ittai, the 75 increase you are right, we were hoping to be well north of 100. And it\u2019s a tough market for hiring out there and we tend to be pretty picky. So, that\u2019s why the guidance this time we said we want to be in excess of 125. We brought on Kristen as EVP of Human Resources and that\u2019s one of the areas of focus that she has been tasked with attacking. So, we want to hire. I think if you go out to our website, you see a lot of postings. And we are trying to be as aggressive as we can about it.","Ittai Kidron","Very good. Good luck, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, you may ask your question.","Jess Lubert","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And two for you. The first I was hoping you could provide some additional insight into the growth you are seeing in the software business. How much of that\u2019s coming from virtual ADC versus security? And then perhaps longer term is this transition from hardware to software-as-a-service business occurs should we be expecting product growth to remain in the low single-digits for a while or would you expect that to reaccelerate as comps sees in fiscal 2016? And then I have got another one.","Manny Rivelo","Okay. So, let me just address the software growth. So, as you know \u2013 and we have talked about this in the past, our business predominantly software, what goes into our platform tends to be predominantly software. And we have been seeing that growth increases as I pointed out in the comments over the course of the last three years. We continue to expect that to increase. But I want to be very clear it\u2019s not as if the market is rapidly transitioning from software to hardware. What we are seeing is a new set of applications that require much more of a scale-out solution and\/or applications that are going directly into cloud environments. We actually think that the future architectures have two tiers associated with it. And what I mean by that is an ingress tier into the data center that requires high-performance hardware to mitigate traffic whether it be firewall services, DDoS attacks and all of those capabilities we provide using our hardware. On top of that, what we see is a second tier, which sometimes tends to be much more propagation tier, which could go to these. So, we think the future will have a mix of both hardware and software.","And then the other part, are we going to see cannibalization of the hardware business? The way we price our VE relative to our hardware is on par from a unit pricing perspective. And I will just give you an absolute data point so you could have that. If you look at a 5-gig virtual edition of our product, it\u2019s about $26,000. Our BIG-IP 2200, it\u2019s about $28,000. So, it\u2019s almost on par and those are both 5-gig devices inside the environment. So, what we are really seeing is customers making a decision much more on whether they want accelerated performance and\/or they want the flexibility of the software for scale-out architecture. So, we don\u2019t anticipate that to be a rapid cannibalization moving by any stretch of imagination.","Andy Reinland","Yes. And then future growth rates you know, Jess, we don\u2019t talk about that or give that out, but we believe our opportunity is there and we need to execute against that. And driving top line growth is what we are all about as an executive team. And I think you will see us continue pushing that and investing to make that happen.","Jess Lubert","And then secondly, I was hoping you could comment on the carrier business, looks like it ticked down sequentially. Do you expect that to improve during the second half of the calendar year? And it sounds like you did sign a few big deals in the quarter. Can you provide any insights to when you think you will start to recognize revenue in some of those larger opportunities and carriers?","Manny Rivelo","Yes. So, we are having good momentum in the carrier space. And as you know, the carrier business tends to be a little lumpy in project base. We did see our largest security, Gi firewall win with a domestic Tier 1 operator. It\u2019s been repeat business and we continue to see that ramping up. We continue to see that same traction in other theaters. But I think what\u2019s also very interesting is that service providers are moving very rapidly to software based architectures using things like NFV, network function virtualization. And our products because we provide the same feature functionality, whether it be on accelerated hardware and as virtual editions are very well suited, we are seeing our huge uptick in proof-of-concepts around NFV. We are seeing that movement really, really rise. So, that\u2019s future opportunity for us early days like we have spoken about, but very exciting for us.","Andy Reinland","And then we did take some revenue in the current quarter on the deals that we talked about and there will be some next quarter too.","Jess Lubert","Thanks, guys. Keep up the good work.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Sir, you may ask your question.","Simon Leopold","Great, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about the effects of foreign exchange in the quarter. It sounds like a number of companies in the technology space are more broadly are feeling effects from either demand or exchange rates given the change in rates, particularly in Europe and a little bit in Asia. So, I know you are selling dollars, you don\u2019t have European direct competitors, but if you could talk about the dynamics of foreign exchange and whether or not you had to do discounting in order to help out the customers overseas? Thank you.","Andy Reinland","Yes. So, in both APAC and LatAm, we did some messaging from our sales organizations that the currency did impact the business. It just tends to slow things down because people want a stable currency. And so we saw a little bit there. In Southern Europe, it\u2019s a little different. It could have been currency. There are also macro issues. But that was slower than we would like to see I mean still looking at that. We haven\u2019t really had to do much additional discounting. It's more working with the sales teams and the partners to get a situation where the currency stabilizes and we can execute the deal. But we haven\u2019t really had to address it through discounting.","Simon Leopold","And have you had any push back from customers asking for discounting or is it simply this is what it is?","Andy Reinland","No, usually what happens because we sell through resellers and distributors, it will come through the channel to us to request for us to partner with them to work a deal. And we just haven\u2019t been getting those types of requests. I think it\u2019s more about the stability of the currency than so much the dollar change.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Troy Jensen from Piper. Sir you may ask your question.","Troy Jensen","I also wanted to offer congrats to Manny and team on the solid quarter here. Manny, I am curious to know how much do you think remains on this Cisco ACE replacement opportunity, it seems like we are pretty long process here?","Manny Rivelo","Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Troy. So we have been executing through that now for about a year and a half. We still see opportunities. Believe it or not, we are still seeing large, significant opportunities. But the low hanging fruit, you could argue is probably being picked in the market. What we are seeing is two things. We are seeing additional opportunities that tend to be not that large from our key accounts, much more the mid-market that we are going after at this point in time. And then what we are seeing is repeat business either, because these were largest installed bases that are being consumed over time and customers are turning dozens or hundreds of devices at a time, so they repeat that purchase cycle. But what we also see when they repeat that purchase cycle, we see them consuming our good better best licensing modules or our software modules. Meaning that we are having a deeper penetration and we are swapping out our traditional ACE load balancer for really an ADC platform and\/or service consolidation platform. So that bodes very well for us. And I think that has continued business for quarters, if not a year plus to come here for us.","Troy Jensen","Okay. Maybe a follow-up here for Andy, Silverline sounds like it\u2019s going well. I was wondering if you could just size that for us, whether the revenue contribution, I also understand it\u2019s probably more on the deferred rev side, so anything you can help us gauge the success would be helpful?","Andy Reinland","Yes. I think you are right. It\u2019s about deferred revenue, really is the metric that we will start to put out there. It\u2019s early days. I think that the message we are putting out there is we have the set of expectations for that business and we are ahead of that plan, and we feel good about it and we feel good about the conversations that it\u2019s creating with customers. We think it's a great add to our overall offerings and we will continue to expand it. And I don\u2019t know if Julian wants to add anything?","Julian Eames","Just to say, it really comes back to the hybrid offering. Half the deals are from existing customers with on-premise product and functionality and then they are bringing Silverline in. And the other half from Silverline does put us into on-premise deals at the same time. And we seem to be doing well against the competition and we are very pleased to be sticking to the plan.","Troy Jensen","Okay. Nice, keep up the good work done.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse Research. Sir your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] for Kulbinder Garcha. Do you guys hear me?","Manny Rivelo","Yes, we can hear you.","Unidentified Analyst","Question is can you tell us about the pricing differences between the virtual ADCs and physical ADCs. And could you tell us also what the sales mix on virtual versus physical has been so far?","Manny Rivelo","We don\u2019t provide sales mix. We will just give you an example, I just provided a moment ago. So I will give you a different unit. So if you look at a 10-gig virtual, right, a 10-gig virtual is $30,000, a BIG-IP 4000 is $30,000. A BIG-IP 4200 is $42,000. So it\u2019s almost comparable, right on a per unit for the same throughput performance. The delta really being the acceleration you get of \u2013 the acceleration you get when you have hardware, you can leverage the FPGAs. So what we see when we do virtual as we see large volume on the software side. So usually there, you are discounting your prices a little more aggressive, but you are picking it up in the volume. So per unit is identical. If a customer was buying a single unit, there will be no doubt in that pricing.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets. Sir, you may ask your question.","Spencer Green","Hi, good afternoon. This is Spencer for Mark Sue. Thanks for taking the question. You talked a little bit about the ADCs, the traditional ADC part of the business is maturing, slowing a bit while you are seeing good source of security, have you already or are you going to \u2013 how quickly are you going to see the shift in spending moving towards the investment in security and the growth in that area?","Manny Rivelo","Yes. What we \u2013 well, our focus has always been on application delivery and it continues to be on that. What we are predominantly seeing is that application delivery in the early days, which started out around availability, has more to care about at the same token security, acceleration and things of that nature. So it\u2019s not that we are positioning a standalone security appliance, what we are positioning is really an application delivery device where security is a key component of that. And that\u2019s the traditional shift. Classically, a typical enterprise and their service provider will be looking at purchasing two or three components or boxes to provide that service, we have been consolidating that into a single fabric. So that\u2019s how we position into the markets that we are really capturing the consolidation play as part of the security solution.","Spencer Green","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Matt Robison from Wunderlich. Sir, your line is open.","Matt Robison","Thanks for taking the question. Andy, can you comment on the CapEx of the facility upgrade, is that \u2013 are we going to see that continue for many quarters. And then I was hoping you could derive a little bit more for us the $0.5 billion addressable market increase that\u2019s going to come with 12 and maybe comment on what\u2019s going on with diameter signaling?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So I think we will see \u2013 you are right, a lot of it has driven our CapEx is investments we have made in our San Jose facility, where we expanded that facility. We put in a tech center in San Jose so that we can bring customers in down there in conjunction with our partners all in the Bay Area. So we think that\u2019s going to be really good. We expanded Tel Aviv. We have been expanding in Seattle. I think you will see one more big quarter next quarter. And then we will continue with expansion and upgrade in Seattle. So to a lesser degree, you will see it continue, I mean it\u2019s all going to be good for hiring.","Manny Rivelo","And Karl talk a little bit about Badger?","Karl Triebes","Yes. Just to parse out a little bit on the market growth here. About half of that growth, we see coming from security, from the additional security products, specifically some of the DDoS and other capabilities we are adding to the product, as well as the portion coming from cloud. So cloud infrastructure basically updating the VEs to run across different cloud environments we are adding badger. It\u2019s actually part of the list and there is a lot of things we are doing with auto-scaling and other capabilities on that side, a bunch of things in service provider. So being able to support the mobile core better, adding capabilities there are a number of functions and also enhancing the firewall, the S\/Gi firewall components or the firewall components.","Matt Robison","Okay. Anything about diameter signaling?","Manny Rivelo","Anything \u2013 I am sorry, on diameter signaling, is that the question?","Matt Robison","Yes.","Manny Rivelo","Actually in badger, we are actually adding core to big IT new scalability for diameter signaling. And then we also have some new opportunities on the \u2013 on our traffic products with regards to like we call SRF. So basically, it\u2019s managing some subscribers. We call some subscriber line management, some other things we are getting with Tier 1 carriers.","John Eldridge","Okay. Well, this is John Eldridge, excuse me for interrupting but we would like to take two more questions and then we will call it.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Security. Sir you may ask your question.","Brent Bracelin","Thank you. Two quick questions, one for Manny, one for Andy, if I could, Manny first off, if I go back it\u2019s been about 4 years since, I think Version 11 was formally launched coming out here with Version 12. As you think about this release and kind of what it means to F5, how important of a release is it, is this really more a continuation of security or is there something else we should think about relative to the release and then again one follow-up for Andy?","Manny Rivelo","Alright. Brent, I will kick it off and I will turn over to Karl here, because he [indiscernible] because four years ago, I still wasn\u2019t at the company, but in general, 12.0 is a great release. And what it does for us, I think what you have seen from our portfolio where we have expanded. Our vision is really all about hybrid, which is expanded beyond the traditional availability sort of services and we are moving to offer our services, not only on on-prem, and also in a modernized SDN environment. There is a lot of integration associated with that, where we continue to harden our product to make our product easier to work in modern SDN or data center environments, but equally how we run our services inside the cloud. So, what you are seeing is the platform expanding so that application services can be at all locations in any kind of infrastructure. And that\u2019s the core to the part of 12.0. And Karl, maybe you want to add a little color to that?","Karl Triebes","Yes, just add to that, Badger is our largest release to-date, 194 major features are being released with Badger. And yes, we are doing a lot of work in security. Obviously, that\u2019s a big area for us. So, we are adding capabilities across the board in security. SSL is a big area that we focused a lot of attention especially in the areas of performance and adding new cyber suites and being able to address applications, but also we have had a lot just into the core of the product being able to address protocols like HTTP 2.0. And that\u2019s big because customers are shifting to 2.0, because one, it\u2019s less costly for them to support it with their applications, and two, the performance is much better. And so we are supporting that. Service provider, there is a number of areas that we are enhancing support service provider functionality, including things with our firewall on our 10 modules and see just across the board we are doing things to help enable core service provider, including NFV-based applications. And then also supporting cloud partners in being able to make \u2013 we made major enhancements to support VMware, Microsoft, Cisco and others to make ourselves much more natively deployable into their environments. And then there is other things that we have done within our hardware platforms. We talk about our software-defined hardware. While we have two new major functions that we are releasing to help support significant increases in DNS performance, for example and also significant increases in security performance being able to offer with a lot more functionality into the hardware itself. So, there is a lot of major functions across the board to address some of these \u2013 the things that Manny articulated early on in what he was talking.","Brent Bracelin","Helpful color. And then for Andy here real quickly if I look at your guide for our cash flow from ops for Q4, it looks like you are on pace to grow cash flow 25% this year, 2x faster than revenue. As you kind of think philosophically about kind of cash flow, do you expect cash flow to continue to be growing faster than revenue here looking out into the next couple of years here? Is that tied to mix shift to software or mix shift to subscription? Just trying to get a little more color as you think about cash flow kind of growing faster than revenue?","Andy Reinland","Yes. To be honest, we really approach there is so much more on profitability and that\u2019s our focus. I do think that as the Silverline services ramp up that will drive cash flow more strongly, but we will see. I don\u2019t \u2013 I actually not really comfortable talking about guiding cash flow from that perspective. But I think the way you see it operate focus on the top line growth managing our profitability, staying on top of the business is something that we plan to continue.","Brent Bracelin","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Last question on queue is Subu Subrahmanyan from Juda Group. Sir, your line is open.","Subu Subrahmanyan","Thank you. Two quick ones. First on product revenue growth, Manny, if you can talk about the levers of given the growth you have seen on the software side, how should we think about software versus hardware product revenue growth? And we are seeing hard revenue growth slow kind of to the mid single-digit range and you mentioned that as a priority. So, how should we think about that going into next year? And then on the telco side, you mentioned the move to NFV being aggression on that front. And I just wanted to see if how that changes the growth profile that\u2019s been tested at all with the ADC business in the telco side understanding that a lot of the security stuff is incremental?","Manny Rivelo","Yes. So, we don\u2019t break down the hardware\/software revenue as we go forward. But what we are seeing is obviously because it\u2019s smaller numbers, the software business is outpacing the hardware business from a growth perspective. We don\u2019t think that there will be a little bit of a mix shift for an enterprise from the perspective that maybe three years ago, they were buying all hardware, but the enterprises we talked to \u2013 the service providers we talked to are not going 100% software. They are really going as I depicted earlier to these two tier architectures with a set of hardware services that are going \u2013 that you need to scale, scale up really meaning throughput, connection for second things of that nature and the second tier of scale out services that are much more at the application environment. So, we actually think it\u2019s incremental. What we think also it\u2019s incremental is in cloud solutions. Cloud solutions, when customers move application more close to the cloud predominantly that\u2019s the software play. There is a couple of cloud providers that have hardware options, but in general, it\u2019s a software place. So, we think that\u2019s going to mix. You want to add to that, Karl?","Karl Triebes","Yes, I was going to add \u2013 just add to the NFV comments, what we are seeing from the operators, customers they are looking for operational leverage. So, what they want to do is imply whatever software, whatever hardware they can that reduces their operational cost. Their problem is their budgets are scaling linear to the traffic that\u2019s growing exponentially. And so they need a way to manage that. And the way they are doing that is through automation and they want to be able to automate not only aspects of the applications, but their entire environment. We play a key role in being able to bridge the applications to the environment and support that overall automation requirement. And so that\u2019s what they are looking at us for the private part of NFV in addition of being able to support whatever footprint they need software versus hardware.","Manny Rivelo","Alright. So, you will see the telcos and I will close on this is the NFV movement is really a management of the total cost of ownership for service providers. And that\u2019s been predominantly because the cost \u2013 how they were monetizing their networks historically has been a throughput or bandwidth type of connection. The internet traffic and the consumer is consuming both services costs and they could provide it. So, as a result of that, they have to go attack the network cost, scaling the network cost through software sometimes is easier for them to do and are lot more predictable. So, we are seeing that rapid movement by most of the telcos out there. But don\u2019t confuse the fact that they are also going to have hardware. They have 100-gig interfaces and above and those interfaces have to be provisioned through hardware sets of technology. So, it\u2019s a mix that you are going to see, it\u2019s a shift of hardware to hardware\/software.","Subu Subrahmanyan","If I could just follow-up on the product revenue point, the product revenue growth this quarter at 5%. I mean, do you see that \u2013 is it just some mix things that are impacting right now and do you see that reaccelerating in line with kind of overall growth? How should we think about product revenue in the intermediate term?","Andy Reinland","Yes. We are not going to talk about specific guidance on product revenue except to say, again, it\u2019s our number one priority and that\u2019s where we are focused on doing and how we are managing and driving the business forward.","Subu Subrahmanyan","Thank you.","John Eldridge","Okay. Thank you again all of you for joining us on this call. And we hope you have a good quarter and we will do our best to put up another good quarter and we\u2019ll talk to you again in three months or so.","Manny Rivelo","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference.

Fiscal Q2 of 2014 was a quarter of solid execution as customers continue to embrace our solution increased adoption of our new tired pricing model good better best and continued momentum with our security and service provider business.","Revenue of $420 million was above our guided range of $408 million to $418 million, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter and 20% year-over-year. GAAP EPS of $0.91 per share was above our $0.87 to $0.90 guidance. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.27 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.23 to $1.26 per share.","Product revenue of $225.1 million grew 3% sequentially and 22% year-over-year representing 54% of total revenue. Service revenue of $194.9 million increase 4% sequentially 18% year-over-year and accounted for 46% of total revenue. Revenue from the America is accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter. EMEA contributed 24%, APAC 14%, and Japan 6%. On a year-over-year basis America\u2019s revenue grew 25%; EMEA revenue grew 23%; Japan revenue 17%; APAC revenue was essentially flat.","Enterprise customers represent 65% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23% and government sales were 13% including 5% of total sales from U.S. Federal. In Q2, we have three greater than 10% distributors; Ingram Micro, which represented 16.9% of total revenue; Avnet, which accounted for 14.4%; and Westcon, which accounted for 12.3%.","Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 82%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.4%. GAAP operating expenses were $233.5 million, slightly above our guided range of $226 million to $233 million, a result of strong hiring as we continue to invest in our expanding market opportunities. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $201.5 million. GAAP operating margin was 26.4%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 37.2%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.8%.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was $82 million, reflecting the large Federal tax payment is normal in our fiscal second quarter. After repurchasing 1.4 million shares of our common stock for a total of $150 million, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.16 billion in cash and investments, approximately $631 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program.","DSO at the end of Q2 was 48 days. Inventories were $20.7 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $587.7 million. We ended the quarter with 3,635 employees, an increase of 115 from the prior quarter.","During his prepared comments, John will provide an update on the various business drivers that contributed to our growth in the first half of fiscal 2014. As we entered the back half of the year, we believe these drivers will contribute to continued revenue growth and improving profitability. For the third quarter of fiscal 2014 our revenue target is $428 million to $438 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% range, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 83.5%.","We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $228 million to $236 million. This includes approximately $27.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.3 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 38.5% in a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5%. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.99 to $1.02 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.33 to $1.36 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by over a 100 employees in the current quarter. We estimate DSO will be in the high 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $20 million to $23 million and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $130 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our performance in Q2. We experienced good year-over-year growth across most of our major focused business areas and the most pleasing metric in the quarter was the 22% year-over-year growth in product revenues. From a sales perspective the Americas, EMEA and Japan all recorded double-digit year-over-year sales booking sales bookings growth.","However, sale in Asia Pacific region were flat over last year due mainly to a drop in sales in China. Our services business delivered another solid quarter with 18% year-over-year revenue growth, and added a healthy increase to our deferred revenue balance, which now stands at $588 million.","If you recall we introduced our new pricing and tiering strategy Good, Better, Best, in the middle of last quarter. And we were very happy with the customer adoption especially in the Best category. Q2 was our first dual quarter with the GBB go-to-market model. GBB sales were up 83% quarter-on-quarter in Q2 with over 78% buying Best.","This is significantly above the original modeling assumptions and this trend, combined with good sales execution with software module sales, resulted in our software revenues reaching a record high in the quarter with software sales in the high percentage of overall revenues ever. We had another solid quarter with sales of our security solutions.","Security continues to be the major growth driver of our business was strong sales across the securities solutions portfolio including ASM, APM and AFM. We had two multi million dollars sales wins the quarter for the F5 solutions replaced existing competitors\u2019 solutions. In the financial market, we replaced the incumbent with a very large APM access sales win.","And in the service provider vertical a Tier 1 service provider purchased our AFM firewalls to replace their existing traditional data center firewalls. We now have two world-class security operations live and operational in Seattle and Tel Aviv to support a new online security service from our Versafe acquisition. We are starting to see sales wins of the Versafe services which includes state-of-the-art technology for Internet anti-fraud, anti-phishing and anti-malware solutions.","And we have a number of large proof-of-concepts underway for these subscription-based services. We also announced our secure Web Gateway solution last quarter. And we are starting to build a pipeline of opportunity for this subscription based service. In February F5 and VMware introduced a high-performance secure access solution for Virtual Desktop and Desktop-as-a-Service.","Together, F5 and VMware\u2019s technologies enable organizations to provide a secure experience to the mobile workforce, with the ability to readily and securely access applications wherever they may be all while realizing low-cost and easy deployment. F5 introduced virtual additions of BIG-IP Access Policy Manager tailor-made for VMware Horizon View environments, a companion reference architecture, and an iApp to optimize deployments.","The virtual solutions provide secure access control for Horizon View and are designed for customers of any scale \u2013 whether they are starting small or going big with their Virtual Desktops. We had a very solid performance in the service provider business last quarter. I mentioned the large win that had with our AFM Firewall solution.","In last quarter's conference call, we stated the new release of TMOS version 11.5 and our most recent version of our virtual orchestration engine BIG-IQ, including significant new functionality for our centralized management solution, BIG-IQ Security, for large-scale AFM Firewall deployments. I believe these enhancements and new functionality, combined with our significant price performance advantages, were key factors in the selection of the F5 solution.","Traffix SDC sales continued to be strong in the quarter, with several new and carrier wins as LTE networks expand and add functionality such as LTE roaming. Revenue from Traffix sales were up sequentially from last quarter we continue to experience an improving win rate in competitive engagements. We launched our service provider Synthesis architecture at Mobile World Congress in February and received very positive reactions from the industry pundits, and especially from the service provider customer base.","This included solutions for data traffic management, signaling traffic management, virtualization, NFE, and security. In particular, the two new reference architectures for Gi network consolidation and LTE roaming were very well received. As far as a product roadmap is concerned, we will continue to introduce significant enhancements and world-leading technology in our key areas of focus: security, service providers and mobility, the cloud, orchestration, and software-defined application services. These application services are available to our customers as systems, as software-only solutions, as a combination of both on-premise and\/or in the cloud.","With our new Synthesis architecture customers can improve service philosophy and accelerate time to market through automated provisioning and intelligent orchestration of these application services. The Synthesis architecture is based on an elastic, high-performance fabric which reduces the cost and complexity of deploying software-defined application services across all types of systems and environments.","These environments include software defined networking, virtual infrastructures, traditional on-premise data centers, and both public and private clouds. You may have seen an announcement of our new VIPRION 2200 offering last week. This is another example of F5's commitment to best-of-breed performance, quality, and innovation, flexibility and future-proofing for the customer's data center.","The VIPRION 2200 is the industry's first application delivery controller in a 2U appliance footprint, providing unmatched performance while preserving the customer's investment in VIPRION technology. We believe that the VIPRION 2200 has no real competition in its class and will prove to be well received by our customers. The VIPRION 2200 uses our innovative ScaleN technology to provide resource elasticity and high-density multi-tenancy, expanding the capacity of our physical and virtual solutions to seamlessly scale and consolidate application services on demand.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expected a lot of both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. The drivers of our business remain robust, and we enter Q3 with a very strong pipeline of future business. Our portfolio of application services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn expands our addressable market.","In addition, our Synthesis architecture for software-defined application services provides F5 with the opportunity to play a very strategic role as customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. I am pleased with our results in the first half of the fiscal year, and I feel very optimistic about business prospects for the remainder of the year.","In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners, and customers for their support last quarter. And we'll now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) First question comes from Jeff Kvaal, Northaland. Your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Securities, Inc.","Hi, can you hear me?","John McAdam","Yes.","Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for allow [ph] for the question. I was wondering two things. Number one, you commented a little bit in the press release about the very few surprises in the second quarter. I was wondering if that were the same set of assumptions that you were using towards \u2013 well, first, if you could comment on that; and then, secondly, if that was the same set of assumptions that you were using in the second quarter?","And then my second question may be for Andy, and that is on the gross margins: if software is as high as it's ever been as a percentage of the mix, should we not have expected a little bit more on the gross margin side or what are the variables involved in that? Thank you.","John McAdam","","Yes. On the first one, very few surprises Linearity was as expected pretty solid and normal we didn\u2019t see any significant change in win rates. The business drivers were as expected in other words, security, we we\u2019re very happy with that. We we\u2019re happy with Traffix. We we\u2019re happy with the possibility in enterprise replacing Cisco ACE areas. So, generally it was as expected, hence the no surprise comment.","Andy Reinland","And then to the gross margin, I mean one of the dynamics we have right now is the rollout of our new product line. And whenever you do that, a number of variables come into play around your margin, warranty \u2013 many indirect costs. And so we\u2019re just seeing that dynamic, which is muting the benefits there. But overall, what we are happy with is that we\u2019re managing the gross margin consistently with the last couple of quarters.","Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Securities, Inc.","Okay, so John and does that mean you applied the same set of assumptions for the June quarter when setting that guidance, is that a way to think of that?","John McAdam","","Pretty much, I mean that\u2019s reasonably accurate, I mean obviously one of the things we are excited about is you are going to see things like Versafe, the anti-fraud capability start to com into play, you\u2019re going to see \u2013 we\u2019re going to start introduce a storefront, with the LineRate, so there is other incremental thing, but generally I think that\u2019s a valid assumption.","Jeff Kvaal \u2013 Northland Securities, Inc.","","Okay, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you gentlemen.","Operator","","Thank you, next question from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Greg T. Schuck \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Hi, it is Greg Schuck for Rod Hall. Thanks for taking my question, with regards to securities. Can you guys possibly split out enterprise versus telecom and then also kind of to what extent you guys see yourself in that datacenter implementations at this point? Thanks.","John McAdam","Yes, regarding security, we don't really split out enterprise with telco. I mean I mentioned a couple of times in my introduction that we had that we had a fairly large security deal with our firewall AFM solutions in telco, but we don\u2019t really split it out. What I have said in the past, and I think it's still the situation, is that when you look at service provider, in particular, security is definitely a very, very big opportunity. But it is in the enterprise, as well, so \u2013 but we don't split it out by numbers.","Greg T. Schuck \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Okay. And I guess my follow-up would be \u2013 with June guidance, is it possible to kind of put some color around the Good, Better, Best framework, as to what percent of customers would be kind of on the new pricing versus old? Do you guys have a general sense of that, or is it?","Andy Reinland","No, I think more we are focused on the trend, which \u2013 this was really the first full quarter. And it exceeded our expectations, so we are very happy with that. And I think we will see that continue. But as for breaking it out specifically, we are not going to do that.","John McAdam","","I mean it was Good, Better, Best apart from the obvious benefits of, been easier to package the solutions together for the customer; giving them some incentive to add more modules; what it really gives us is a really easy entry point for the salespeople to start to talk to our customers about that added value. We could easily introduce Good, Better, Best, and then they decide to buy just a vanilla system with maybe one module, but they are thinking about the other modules because we have had the opportunity to talk to them.","Greg T. Schuck \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Jason Ader, William Blair. Your line is open.","Jason Ader \u2013 William Blair & Company","Thanks. A couple of quick ones here. The operating margin was a little lower than I had expected, Andy. And it sounds like you had a good hiring quarter. But you talked about some improvements in the back half. What's the right side of near-term target for operating margins, let's say over the next 6 months to 12 months? That's the first question. And then I'm just a little confused on the GBB comment, John. So when you said GBB sales were up 82% sequentially, what does that mean? What percentage of your customers are actually buying in this way? And how can we even think about that?","John McAdam","Yes. Let me answer it. So we had about half the quarter when the introduced it in the previous quarter, in Q1. Q2 is our first dual quarter, and the amount of revenue that we saw with GBB sales was up 82% from that half quarter sale. That's fundamentally what it is. We are not going to split out the actual numbers in terms of the revenue, but we are very happy with the results. And we are especially happy with the split \u2013 the percentage that went towards the Best of the GBB.","Andy Reinland","I'm going to answer that \u2013 the operating margin. The way we are looking at it now, we think we are in a great spot. We have good revenue growth going. We are generating strong cash, increasing EPS; and at the same time, we see some opportunities that we want to invest in. So I stand behind my comments. We are going to see profitability ramping in the back half, but we are going to be looking at opportunities to invest that we think will drive the top line. That's how we are going to approach it.","Jason Ader \u2013 William Blair & Company","So you are not going to give any specific number for the next, whatever, sort of near-term operating model kind of number, like you gave in the past?","Andy Reinland","Yes. Well, you know, we generally in specific hard numbers really are quarter out. So you can look at our guidance and kind of lay it out, and with the ranges that we gave see where we are going to land. And then when we get beyond that, it's usually directionally \u2013 usually not beyond the fiscal year. So I'm kind of sticking to those comments. So we are going to see a ramp through the back half of the year. And then come October, we will address to in a general direction for next year at that time.","Jason Ader \u2013 William Blair & Company","Thanks.","Operator","Next question Ehud Gelblum, Citi Research. Your line is open.","Stan Kovler \u2013 Citigroup","Hi. Thanks, everyone. It's Stan Kovler in for Ehud. I just wanted to cover some of the demand areas. Do you feel like demand is really coming from replacements and current customers with higher mix? You mentioned the GBB; 70% of those are coming in at the higher end or is it just the overall demand in the market is increasing?","If you could specifically touch on the area of cloud and how some of those customers are doing, and what they are deploying in the context of your competitors, as well. There are some competitors in that space for either virtual or some of the platform products that they have. And then the final question for Andy, just a housekeeping on OpEx. It came in a little higher; just following up on the last question there. Do you expect to hire at the same pace for the rest of the year? Thanks a lot.","John McAdam","Yes and this is John and I\u2019ll talk about it, and I think Manny can talk about some of the cloud things and then Andy will give the answer to his question. Its interesting when you say demand, one of the things that I\u2019m very about at the moment is that over a fairly short space of time, we really have expanded our addressable markets. The acquisition of Traffix is a good example of that.","We feel very good about what we are seeing with the Versafe subscription service. We think we have an opportunity there. We are going to be getting more active with the LineRate solution for web developers. Security, the demand there that we see for our module sales, and all three of them. Clearly, the traditional firewall is a greenfield opportunity for us and we are starting to see some real good success there.","So from that perspective and then I think Good, Better, Best, the product refresh and the ACE opportunity are all big opportunities. That's why we\u2019ve been hiring, we're hiring because we are seeing demand overall as an opportunity. And Andy will give you more details in your specific question, but I think you will see us doing that in the future, because it would be crazy not to do that.","And then as part of that, if you look at the technology changes that are happening with the cloud that Manny can comment in a second; the pricing structures that are buying capabilities of the customer. We think we are in really good shape when we look at our current portfolio of products with software and BIG-IQ, and areas like that. So we think we are in a real sweet spot of a lot of these very significant changes.","Manuel F. Rivelo","And just \u2013 Stan just to add some comments \u2013 this is Manny \u2013 on the cloud side. So on the cloud side; what we are seeing is a massive adoption from our customer base around hybrid clouds, both on-prem, off-prem type solutions. . And there is a couple of metrics I will share with you, or data points I will share with you, just to give you an indication of the success we are having on that.","One is that our Virtual Edition, which is our software version supported across a magnitude of hypervisors, has seen both significant quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year growth. We continue to see that every single quarter, and we are very happy with that. In addition to that, just this quarter we also launched a $95 Virtual Lab Edition, so customers can try that edition in the market segment. And that, again, has had an incredible ramp-up rate, because people are trying smaller workloads out in the cloud and making sure those solutions work.","So we saw great, great momentum with that. And then, third, we are launching some new licensing programs also for the cloud. They make it a little simpler for users to buy cloud-based services and for cloud providers to package solutions to the market segment. And we are seeing that take off in the market segment, as well as the number of cloud partners. Our philosophy is pretty simply to make sure that our solutions are available in the cloud in addition to be enterprise, and enable customers to have this hybrid solutions set.","Andy Reinland","Stan and then, as far as hiring goes, I said that we are going to add above 100 for the current quarter. And I think we will continue that pace through the rest of the fiscal year.","Stan Kovler \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks. That's very helpful. If I could just follow up on one more question. If I add up all the indirect sales that you mentioned in the top three indirect sales channels, it looked like sequentially from those three folks the revenue declined slightly. And, obviously, overall revenue grew. Can you just help us understand what's going on with direct versus indirect there?","Andy Reinland","That the numbers that we give there are distributors, right, but then go through resellers. So it's a little bit to look at \u2013 it is just dependent on how sales break down and who the customers want to work through and resellers want to work through. We are required to disclose it. But there's nothing I'd read into that from one quarter to the next.","Stan Kovler \u2013 Citigroup","Thanks a lot.","Operator","","Next question from Pierre Ferragu, Bernstein. Your line is open.","Pierre Ferragu \u2013 Bernstein Global Wealth Management","Thank you for taking my question. I have, actually, one very specific question on China. You mentioned sales there were clearly below the trend of other regions in the world. If you could give us some color on how things are developing there that would be very useful. And then, more broadly, about a year ago you had, like, a slowdown in sales, and that was mostly driven by the service provider segment, where orders can be lumpy.","And so I was wondering in your performance today and your revenues in this quarter could you give us some sense of whether your numbers are being supported by actually very large orders from these very large cloud-type customers, or very large operators? And if we \u2013 there is a bit of a risk of lumpiness in your revenues because of that in, I don't know, in the next 12 months or something like that. Thank you.","Andy Reinland","Okay. Regarding China, I think I've said \u2013 certainly I said it on the last call, I may have said it on the call before, it is a tough environment. We've seen that when we have looked at some of our peers' results as well. I think that\u2019s going to continue for a while. We have probably bottomed out in terms of the opportunity there. I don\u2019t think there's much risk of it being worse. However, it's not an area that we are putting any big expectations in when we get guidance. As I say, I think that's pretty much across the technology board right now.","Regarding our lumpiness, unfortunately, there's always the opportunity for lumpiness in the service provider business. I think our portfolio has increased dramatically that will in some way mitigate against that lumpiness. I'm not saying we have totally mitigated; we have not, but certainly, with the security operation we\u2019ve got opportunity we have there, with Traffix opportunities with LTE rollout with mobile traffic steering to some degree, we have a bigger portfolio there, but there always that opportunity.","In terms of the specifics, I think you were asking, where there any really massive orders? Not really I mean, we had good orders, million dollar plus-type orders, but nothing way of the ordinary. Overall, the number of million dollar orders was actually quite solid, but that includes enterprise as well as service provider.","Pierre Ferragu \u2013 Bernstein Global Wealth Management","","Thanks, very much.","Operator","","Next question from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty & Co. Your line is open.","Catharine Trebnick \u2013 Dougherty & Co","","Thank you very much for taking my question. Could either \u2013 one of the questions I had is you \u2013 so you had a few wins for security in the service provider area. Could you give us some more color on was it more datacenter? Have you sold into any of the mobile Internet aspects of it? And then the follow-on question is well, take that one first. Thank you.","Manuel F. Rivelo","So, hey Catharine, its Manny, how are you? Real quick, just on the service provider, I\u2019ll give you one. Tier-1 operator. It was a data center solution set. Basically, it was a pretty significant data center solution set, protecting their applications for both DDoS mitigation all the way up to Layer 7 firewall security, application security, as well as traffic steering functionality for their data center. That was one of many footprints that service provider has. And that was a significant deal.","That was predominantly midrange product in our portfolio, but significant in the sense that it was lots of units that are going out there. So we feel pretty fortunate with that. That's a data center solution. In addition to that, that same service provider has a Gi solution that we are right now in proof-of-concept with. So we are pretty excited about that opportunity, which we think is equal, if not much larger, than the current opportunity ahead. And that applies to stuff across the world . I'm just giving you one example.","Catharine Trebnick \u2013 Dougherty & Company","No, no. I understand that totally. And then the other question is on Traffix. You did say that that was up quarter-over-quarter. Are the deals more for LTE roaming, or are they any specific area that you are getting more traction with than others? And are you replacing Tekelec in some of these deals?","Andy Reinland","Yes. This is Manny, again. So, yes, it is LTE roaming. We are seeing a lot of that. We are seeing some basic just DRA load-balancing functionality for the signals that are out there. And then we have done in certain situations replaced Tekelec out there. Again, we are seeing a lot of good momentum in that environment. And we are talking to a lot of the service providers that are out there. There's no question Tekelec had early entry into the market been in the market longer than we were. But we feel pretty comfortable that from a technology perspective, our solution is comparable to anything the market and really superior to all. That\u2019s out there.","Catharine Trebnick \u2013 Dougherty & Company","All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Sanjiv Wadhwani \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus and Company","Thanks, two questions. John, the enterprise vertical did really well this quarter. I was wondering if there was any granularity you could give on certain areas that might have exceeded expectations, like financial services, etc. And then for Andy on the Good, Better, Best pricing, I know you have talked a little bit about the gross margin puts and takes around \u2013 with your software, sort of percentage going higher. But over time, as you see more and more deals queuing towards the best categories, should we be seeing a positive impact on gross margins over the next 12, 18 months?","Andy Reinland","Yes. On the enterprise vertical or the enterprise business, yes, it was very solid. The finance, by the way, is always a good one for us. It is like security. It is \u2013 like, new architectures, including hybrid clouds and if we are really in the great spot for that so I expect that to continue, but it was pretty solid. And I just see the last quarter that from a sales perspective that was also solid last quarter as well.","John McAdam","I mentioned the Good, Better, Best I've answered that I think yes, in theory, adding more modules that are purely software to increase sorter size should help the margin, but we are careful not to guide that for a lot of reasons. A lot of it is strategic, that we want to keep that close in case we want to use that with our channel partners or in other ways. So, but in theory, your question is right. It gives us flexibility.","Sanjiv Wadhwani \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus and Company","","Got it. Helpful. Thanks.","Operator","","Matt Robison, Wunderlich Securities. Your line is open.","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","Hey, thanks for taking the question. On the Versafe, do you envision that activity ever becoming material to CapEx?","Andy Reinland","In terms of spend support?","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Yes, spend to support.","Andy Reinland","Yes. I think it could add somewhat, but as we model it out and look at growth, we think it will be in line. Nothing that we think would accelerate CapEx abnormally.","John McAdam","We\u2019ve already done\u2014we didn't have a Seattle security operations center up until we introduced it just recently. And I mentioned that in the call. And that I didn\u2019t have a massive effect on the CapEx. ","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","","So do you think that your model in terms of \u2013 as it matures and starts to hit its business plan, you won't see an increase in CapEx to revenue from it?","Andy Reinland","","I think we could a little bit, but I don't think anything that would draw attention. I think we would manage it in the broader business.","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","I mean we are much more excited in terms of the fact it's subscription-based service, and as we add more wins that revenue number goes up, I think that\u2019s the goal. Obviously, there will be some investments in doing that, but I think the prominent thing is the revenue and the contribution to earnings.","John McAdam","","Yes. I get that. And we are kind of seeing a bit of a trend amongst companies that come with technology that they are trying \u2013 they are managing it a bit more, whereas they used to just sell it. That's why I bring it up.","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Thanks.","Okay, Brian, this is John Eldridge we\u2019re going to take two more questions and then wrap it up.","Operator","","Okay. Next question comes from Paul \u2013 from Paul Silverstein with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Paul Silverstein \u2013 Cowen and Company","Guys, I was wondering if you just \u2013 I want to revisit a couple of questions and just some clarifications. First off, John, I heard your comment about the million dollar deals, in general. Can you give us the average deal size, is there any change?","John McAdam","Yes, actually the average order size that which is the metric we give, it had been pretty steady right at the $100,000 but we saw that increase last quarter 200%. So about a 10% increase.","Paul Silverstein \u2013 Cowen and Company","Andy, was there also an increase in the large deals? I think historically you have shared with us million-dollar-plus deals.","Andy Reinland","There was my commented on the last end of we did see a nice increase in the number of \u2013 on the revenues total revenue to be go from $1 million deal plus.","Paul Silverstein \u2013 Cowen and Company","So there was general increase. And then going back to your comment earlier about the increase in software content will help, but you may choose to be strategic in terms of passing on benefits, potentially. And I thought I heard you say that new product introductions had somewhat of a muting impact on the benefit you otherwise would have seen from software. Was there anything extraordinary about this new product introduction? Or was this \u2013 all things being equal, if you don't pass on the benefits going forward, we would see the benefits show up in gross margin? I mean, really focusing just on that new product introduction piece. Anything extraordinary about this go-around? ","Andy Reinland","Now this really nothing extraordinary we generally see when we come out with new products systems were working through managing the supply chain as we are managing warranty reserve, manufacturing costs. We see those increased costs I think to some extent you kind of merging two questions together work the Good, Better, Best pricing which add software modules over longer period of time, in theory could improve the gross margin. The short-run question that was asked was: why this specific quarter? John made the comment that our software tax rates were at an all-time level; why we didn't see that in the gross margin and I was saying that was offset in the short-run by in fact that we are in the stage of new product introduction.","Paul Silverstein \u2013 Cowen and Company","Understood. And then China as a percent of your Asia-Pac revenue \u2013 what is the issue, John? Obviously, we have all seen the reports about economic activity in China subsiding. There's the U.S. issue in terms of the technology concerns. Can you identify \u2013 are you able to identify what the particular issue is? If it's general, with respect to perception of risk, or something else? Is China roughly consistent with being 50% of Asia-Pac economy? Would that be about right for your impact on you?","Andy Reinland","","No it\u2019s lower than that. And there is tough one because as I say, it's not we are not \u2013 we are doing business there, but we have defiantly over the last probably 12 months and 9 months, 12 month we definitely seen its just tough environment in terms of getting orders from customers et cetera. Whether that\u2019s that's endemic or not, who knows? I guess it is what it is.","Paul Silverstein \u2013 Cowen and Company","One last one. U.S. Fed \u2013 any insight you could share with us, what you are seeing there?","John McAdam","I\u2019m sorry.","Paul Silverstein \u2013 Cowen and Company","U.S. Federal.","John McAdam","Yes. I mean we are pretty comfortable with U.S. Federal; we really like the team that was got in place. By definition we tend to expect a very solid quarter come September and I think we\u2018ll see that. If you are selling solutions that are based on datacenter consolidation, the cloud and the internet then you are in good share, and that\u2019s what we do. So I think that continues to be a key market for us.","Paul Silverstein \u2013 Cowen and Company","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Okay, last question at Brian Marshall, ISI Group. Your line is open.","Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thanks, guys. Since Paul asked three, I\u2019ll just ask one. I think \u2013 congratulations. I mean this is the first quarter in roughly two years that we grew the top line 20% year over year. So obviously moving back in the right direction, well done. Sequentially we grew at almost $15 million. Now, I'm not expecting a complete breakout, but can you talk a little bit about how your core underlying business is growing from a dollar standpoint and versus all these new opportunities that you have in security and other things, et cetera. Just kind of curious what the underlying growth look like for the core business if you strip out all the new incremental stuff. Thanks, and well done.","John McAdam","This gives life to this whole discussion about what really is our core business. Remember, our definition of an ADC Application Delivery Controller is basically a platform, and that can be a software platform or a system platform or a combination of both, but it\u2019s certainly a part of a bigger architecture. That includes on that platform the ability to expand an addressable market by adding more and more bundle solutions security being a classic example.","So when we sell BIG-IP 4000 and we have our application file with a module on that, we view that as ADC market. And that's what we do and then obviously there is revenue associated with each solution, but you'll just see that continues to expand, in other words, we believe we are expanding an addressable market Brian and we don\u2019t even look at it as what is the basic core market? We look at: what's the current expandable market that we are driving to and that\u2019s definitely expanding aggressively.","Brian Marshall \u2013 ISI Group","Understood. Thanks, John.","John Eldridge","Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us. We look forward to hooking up with you again at the end of the third quarter. And again if you have any questions, please give me a call.","John McAdam","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude the call for today.

We ended our fiscal 2017 on a solid note, with record revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter. With solid growth in our virtual ADC offerings, particularly in public cloud environments, and continued strength in sales of our security offerings. Fourth quarter revenue of $538 million, up 4% from the prior quarter and 2% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $530 million to $540 million.","GAAP EPS of $2.14 per share was well above our guidance of $1.64 to $1.67 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.44 per share was also above our guidance of $2.23 per share. I will discuss these strong EPS results in more detail later in my comments.","Product revenue of $249 million in the fourth quarter was down 2% year-over-year and accounted for 46% of total revenue. Service revenue of $289 million grew 6% year-over-year and represented 54% of total revenue.","On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 1% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, increased 1% year-over-year, and Japan at 4% of total revenue, was also up 1% from a year ago. Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 19%, and government sales were 16%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.","In Q4, we had four greater-than-10% distributors; Westcon, which accounted for 15% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15%; Tech Data, which accounted for 13%; and Arrow at 10%.","Moving on to our operating results, GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5%. In Q4, we undertook a comprehensive business review and analysis of our strategy. Through this process, we took measures to better align resources around our strategy for growth. In particular, we will be accelerating investment in our roadmap and route-to-market efforts in the fastest growing areas of our business, cloud and security. As a result, we took a $12.7 million restructuring charge that is reflected in our GAAP OpEx results.","GAAP operating expenses of $299 million were above our $283 million to $293 million guided range as a result of the restructuring charge. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $248 million, in line with expectations. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 27.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.8% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.8%.","During the quarter, the company repatriated $86 million of cash to the US. As a result, the company was able to utilize the cumulated foreign tax credits, which resulted in a one-time GAAP tax and EPS benefit of $21 million. We view this gain as a one-time occurrence resulting from proactive initiatives associated with executing our ongoing tax planning strategy. Both GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates also benefited from year-end adjustments related to our mix of profits recorded in lower tax rate jurisdictions.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated a record $213 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments in totaling $1.3 billion at year-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7.5 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $964 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,365 employees, down 150 from the prior quarter.","In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.26 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $119.06 per share for a total of $150 million. After the end of the quarter, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1 billion for the company's share repurchase program.","For all of fiscal 2017, revenue was $2.1 billion, up 5% from fiscal year 2016. Product revenue of $965 million grew 2% from the prior year and accounted for 46% of total revenue. Service revenue of $1.1 billion grew 7% during the year and represented 54% of the total. GAAP net income for fiscal year 2017 was $421 million or $6.50 per share, and non-GAAP net income was $543 million or $8.38 per share.","For fiscal year 2017, cash flow from operations totaled a record $740 million and capital expenditures were $39 million.","Moving to our guidance for Q1, we remain confident in our position in the market and growth opportunities for the business, with solid momentum in the cloud and security space. While we see continued impact on near-term spend by customers evaluating their application architectures, the long-term trend toward multi-cloud environments is a strong and fundamental growth driver for our solutions. With this in mind as well as factoring in our normal seasonality, for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, we are targeting revenue in a range of $515 million to $525 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in the amortization of purchased intangible assets.","Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $288 million to $298 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.47 to $1.50 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.02 to $2.05 per share.","Finally, as has been our practice, we want to provide you with broad modeling assumptions for the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2018, from the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins in the 84% to 85% range for the year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing through the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million for the year. Capital expenditures are expected to range from $8 million to $10 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and smaller facilities projects.","In addition to these costs, we anticipate approximately $30 million to $40 million in CapEx cost related to our previously announced move of our corporate headquarters to F5 Tower in downtown Seattle as we ready the space for occupancy in calendar 2019.","We expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 32% to 34% on a GAAP basis and 30% to 32% on a non-GAAP basis for the year. These effective tax rates do not factor in potential impact from federal tax reform initiatives.","As Jason mentioned, we will host our Analyst Investor Meeting on March 8 in New York.","With that, I will turn the call over to Fran\u00e7ois.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Andy and good afternoon everyone. We ended fiscal 2017 by delivering record revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow for the quarter and the full year. During the fourth quarter, we saw strong momentum in our virtual addition and advanced application security offerings and solid performance in our services business. We are excited by increasing customer interest in our software-based solutions, and we expect this area of the business to be a key long-term growth driver.","In Q4, we undertook a comprehensive business review with the goal of examining both the near- and long-term strategy for the company. The process solidified our belief in the long-term growth opportunity within our core application services market, enabled by the growing importance of application security and emerging consumption models for ADC technologies.","We see customers increasingly adopting a multi-cloud strategy, with a wide range of applications hosted across on-premise, private, co-located and public cloud infrastructure. This multi-cloud world allows customers to more easily develop and deploy applications, but it also brings new challenges in application delivery and security to the forefront. We are confident that our breadth of application knowledge and our depth of product capabilities position us to be the key partner in helping customers solve these growing complexities.","Commitment to this strategy is already evident in the solution offerings we are bringing to market, which are focused on more flexible purchasing models for virtual editions and making our offerings more lightweight, more scalable, and easier to manage. In the planning process for our fiscal 2018 year, we prioritized R&D and go-to-market resources, the key focus areas of cloud enablement and application security. We are also in the process of strengthening our senior leadership team around these competencies.","As we move forward, we expect to invest aggressively in hiring and resourcing high-priority areas, while ensuring that we manage our operating expense levels to continue the company's track record of delivering strong profitability. We look forward to sharing more detail on our long-term strategy and introducing several new additions to the F5 leadership team at our Analyst Meeting on March 8.","Taking a closer look at fourth quarter results. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guided range and we saw strength in our software offerings, including virtual editions and security modules and in solutions for the service provider vertical. Our services business delivered another solid quarter in Q4, with key business metrics including renewal rates, attach rates and pricing in line with historical trends.","In the fourth quarter, we saw several meaningful examples of customers moving forward with projects that have been on hold, as they evaluated their application architectures. We saw a local technology company that had been delaying purchases as they evaluated a cloud-only strategy move forward with our solutions in a hybrid deployment approach as they realized not all their applications were best supported by a public cloud environment.","In another example, after an extended evaluation of various cloud options, a large financial services customer moved forward with F5 solutions in conjunction with Equinix and a public cloud provider. This decision was driven by our ability to allow the customer to replicate their security posture across a multi-cloud environment.","In the fourth quarter, we saw continued momentum from our web application firewall offerings. We closed the deal with a major U.S. credit union consisting of appliance, software, and professional services solutions that was driven by the capabilities of our WAF offering to address specific threat requirements.","During the quarter, we received a strong third-party validation of our leading WAF solutions. Industry analyst firm Gartner placed our WAF offerings in the leader section of their Magic Quadrant. As part of a more focused security strategy, we see WAF playing an increasingly important role as more customers realize the need to deploy this layer of protection in front of an increasingly large number of applications. This sentiment was echoed to me in a conversation I had with a large European bank, where their internal policies are migrating to require a WAF in front of all applications.","We also had strong results from our advanced firewall manager, where we see growing interest from mobile and fixed line service providers. In the fourth quarter, we saw meaningful follow-on orders from a leading U.S. mobile operator looking to better manage and secure rapidly expanding data traffic and deployments at a large media and technology company to support high-volume traffic for internal applications.","Our advanced application security offerings are proving a key competitive advantage for on-prem deployments and as customers look to migrate applications to the cloud. We believe application security is more essential in the cloud, and we are finding our security capabilities are leading the conversation with customers as they consider shifting workloads to the cloud. This is evident in the stronger attach rates we are seeing for our security solutions in public cloud transactions.","Growth in our virtual editions remained strong during Q4, with sales up over 35% year-over-year for the quarter and for the full year. Revenue from our public cloud, Bring Your Own License and utility offerings more than doubled in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. This demand is being driven by a combination of existing customer's lifting and shifting applications and customers new to F5.","Our advanced application, delivery and security solutions are now available across all major public cloud providers. We view these vendors as important partners as we look to help customers manage and protect their critical applications no matter where they reside.","Recently, we have enhanced our relationship with Amazon Web Services, earning certification for their Security Competency program and launching with the Gulf cloud marketplace.","As part of our increased focus on cloud migration and enablement initiatives, we are excited to be involved in several AWS initiatives around the channel, including AWS's Marketplace Channel Incentive Program and its Channel Opportunity Registration Program. We believe the scalability, feature set, and reliability offered by TMOS, our iSeries platform, and our application security solution remain essential for customers as they look to support mission-critical applications and begin to explore multi-cloud environments.","We are committed to making these solutions available for a variety of purchasing models to meet our customers' needs, including subscription, Enterprise License Agreements and consumption-based pricing.","As we look to FY 2018 and beyond, we are excited by the emerging opportunities across the application services market, and we are well positioned to grow our share in both hardware and virtual solutions. In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support throughout our fiscal 2017 year.","With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question on the line is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. I guess, Fran\u00e7ois, maybe you could help me kind of figure out some of the mixed messages I'm kind of getting, or this is just my interpretation, like on one hand, guidance, it's the third time in a row that I think that you are taking down guidance relative to where the Street is. Yet it sounds like you're very optimistic and you feel comfortable providing visibility to fiscal 2018, that you will be able to grow sequentially through every quarter.","Maybe two questions here. One, what gives you the confidence about your ability to grow starting with the first fiscal quarter of 2018 through the rest of the year? Number one.","And number two, can you help us better understand your realignment? Clearly you reduced head count, but at the same time, we talked about high rank. Was it not a head count that could be repurposed, or for what product areas you kind of pulled back resources, where are you putting them back in? Help us understand where the dollars are going?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Ittai. Good questions. Both are actually related. I'll start with the first one on the confidence we have going into 2018. Look, what we're seeing is, there is potential great drivers of product revenue growth that are actually long-term drivers for the company where we are doing very, very well. And that's the case for what we've seen in the virtual ADC market, with our virtual addition, we grew 35% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for the full-year 2016 versus 2017, and we think that's a long-term trend.","Our business in the public cloud more than doubled both year-over-year and also in the quarter, and we continue to see very strong growth in our security offerings. So these drivers, we think, are emerging trends that are becoming meaningful and are longer-term for the company, so we are very excited about that.","That is actually linked to your second question around the realignment of resources that we made in the fourth quarter. Essentially, we decided to raise the intensity and focus on these areas that are growth areas for the company. And so we're doubling down on our investments in public cloud and in security. We're also doubling down in our investments in the virtual ADC space. And so these are realignments that we made both in our product groups, essentially in our R&D function, but we also made some adjustments at the front-end of the business. So in the global sales organization, we made some adjustments to focus more resources on our cloud enablement partners and also add security specialists. We're doing similar things with our marketing organizations focusing on these programs that target potential growth in the cloud. And so the timing of these adjustments is why you're seeing a sequential decline in head count, but we are going to be aggressive about hiring in these areas where we see potential growth.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","As you look into your virtual addition and cloud business, is there any way for you to tell or track how much of this is just revenue that's moving from an on-premise deployment into just a different consumption model, versus something that drives incremental consumption, revenue upside somewhere, somehow down the road? How do I think about \u2013 because those numbers will grow quite some time as your customers move from on-premise to cloud. But how do I get a sense whether those are incremental and additive to the overall picture versus just a trade from one side to the other?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","I think what we look at, Ittai, is when we look at our public cloud business, there are two components to that. One component is essentially existing customers that are migrating workloads with us to the public cloud. And generally, we have a very strong attach rate. When our customers are migrating workloads where we have been supporting them, we have a very strong attach rate than when we were migrating to the public cloud with them. But we also see net new customers that go and start buying from F5 directly on our virtual addition in the public cloud. And when I mentioned growth earlier in my comments, both areas of our public cloud business have been growing.","The other area that we'll look at is, as we make our virtual offerings more scalable, lighter weight, and we continue to enhance the management and orchestration story around these offerings, we think we're going to be able to address more applications within our own customer base that we are not supporting today. And again, that's an incremental business opportunity for F5.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Very good. Good luck, guys.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Ittai.","Operator","Our next question on the line is from Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much, Fran\u00e7ois. It's Jim Suva from Citi. I believe last quarter, you saw a pause in, I think it was the EMEA region with some delays due to roadmaps and pushouts and Brexit and such. Can you let us know has that continued to linger or have those come back? Because it looks like as it hasn't snapped back. I mean, it was growth, but I'm just wondering if it is fully resolved or still kind of lingering there? And then I'll probably have a follow-up.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Hi, Jim. Generally I would say there were two aspects of the situation in Europe that we mentioned last quarter. One was more macro, and I think we also said there were some elements that were linked to what we felt was our own execution in the region. On the macro environment, which included the Brexit situation and also some regulatory uncertainty, there hasn't been a fundamental change. Some of these regulations we think get taken care of in the first half of next year. But we still think at a macro level there is quite a bit of uncertainty in Europe.","In terms of our own execution, as part of the realignment that we mentioned, we did indeed make substantial changes in the formation and shape of our resources in Europe. And we have started to see some benefits from that. We think we had good execution in Europe this quarter. So we're cautiously optimistic about how we're executing in Europe, but we're still going through some changes. So we want to be cautious about what we see in the next few quarters in the region.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And then my follow-up is on your guidance, both for the December quarter and then your longer-term guidance. Can you help us understand kind of the difference between the product revenues and the service revenues? You'd mentioned sequential growth every quarter. Was that kind of for both of them or is there some lumpiness or some transitions we should model for services versus products?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","No, and we generally don't give guidance on product and services, but I will say to the earlier question of our confidence, our services business as we look out, we feel pretty good about. I mean, we think that's going to be a key component of that sequential growth off of this Q1. Beyond that, there's nothing I would give you to model. Yeah.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks so much for your details and I'll cede the call.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Jim.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. Just two quick questions. Maybe you could talk about the importance you see in sort of the FPGA and the hardware acceleration you guys have traditionally had in the technology and how that's evolving as you guys put more applications in the cloud with your virtual instance. Do you see that as a point of increased R&D focus? Or is that going to flatten out over time? And just sort of how that fits into the competitive landscape.","And then for Q1 in the guidance, just, Andy, if maybe you want to talk about how you see the different verticals growing year-over-year maybe, just a little bit of context of where you think the growth could be across the three main sectors. Thank you.","Ryan Kearny - F5 Networks, Inc.","All right. So thanks, Alex, this is Ryan. So I'll take the first question. Regarding FPGAs, FPGAs has definitely been a focus area for F5 and continues to be. In fact, it's one of the major drivers of the iSeries platforms actually that we've launched over the last year. And it's helping significantly in the price per performance generally on those platforms. Everything we do is software based, and then we look at accelerating different parts of the workload. And so on our iSeries, and on our hardware, it's definitely been a significant benefit to the iSeries platforms.","Now, as some workloads are moving into software and even bit more specifically to public cloud, at the moment we don't make use of FPGA and specific hardware technologies in those environment, but we definitely can in the future. And it's definitely one of the things we are looking at to accelerate workloads in these software and virtual environment.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","And then on the verticals, generally, we don't guide on that, but what I will say is, if we look at government and in particular Fed, that was a little bit disappointing to us this quarter, given what we normally do in a Q4. And I wouldn't expect that to repeat again as I look out to next year. We have some good initiatives in service provider, that I think as we look out, could have very positive impact in that area and both on a roadmap side as well \u2013 we'll talk about that probably more in March, both on that side as well as just go-to-market. In the enterprise, we continue to feel good about is our lead story. So...","Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi, Thanks a lot, guys. I guess, I was just curious about, Fran\u00e7ois, you mentioned other consumption models for customers. I think you referenced ELAs, usage-based models. Can you kind of talk about sort of the industrial, I guess, logic behind doing that? And when might you implement that? And how does that kind of washout for F5 financially, as you move to some of these models? Is it a net positive, neutral, negative? Just give us a sense there. Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, thank you, George. So, George, just in terms of timing, to start with that, we have made available our subscription offerings to our customers on a large scale in Q4, and we're doing the same with our Enterprise License Agreements now. So we're pretty excited about offering this new type of consumption of our technology for our customers, because essentially it gives them more flexibility. And what we're hearing from our customers is they want more flexibility in the way they deploy and scale our technologies and also the way they pay for it, because for some applications there is uncertainty around how fast these applications are going to scale, how much throughput they're going to need, how long an application is going to be in production for. And giving them more flexibility just allows them to put our technology in front of more applications.","So the real, the industrial logic for us is twofold. It's one is serving the needs of our customers and, b, is the opportunity potentially to serve more applications in more places, that includes on-prem, in private clouds and in public clouds. We are seeing this issue of multi-cloud become a big issue for our customers and we're doing a number of things to enable them to consume security and ADC offerings across multiple environments, and we see that as a big driver of adopting F5 as a solution.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","And then just, Pat, on that, the impact of that. So if we take subscription, the volume of that ticks up rather quickly than, yeah, that could have an impact. Generally, you'd see us start talking more about deferred revenue and total contract value, those types of things. As we model out fiscal 2018, we think we're going to see that ticking up through the year, but the incremental value that it's going to create, we think offsets. But we're going to watch that very closely, and we'll update you if we feel \u2013 we think that's going to impact our longer-term model.","The end goal, of course, is that over the lifecycle of a customer and looking at how long our customers utilize our technology, we believe it actually over time has significant increase to the overall dollars realized from each of those customers. So hence why deferred revenue and total contract value will come into play.","On the utility model, we see that as purely incremental, right? It's our technology out in the public cloud where people can pick it up and use it just using a credit card, and that is something we've never offered before. So, small dollars still, but seeing that growth there, seeing it utilized in those environments, we just think adds incrementally to us.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Got it.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","The other thing, George, just for clarity, the subscription offerings then the utility offerings are available only for our software and solutions. So think about that available for virtual additions either on-premise or in the public cloud, but it only applies to that portion of our business.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question on the line comes from Michael Genovese from MKM Partners. Your line is now open.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Great. Thanks a lot. I just was wondering if you have a view either from yourselves or from industry analysts on what the TAM rate of your business is, specifically ADCs. How much do we think about them growing that market over the next year or two?","And then secondly, in the past, we always heard you talk about the product revenue growth as a key kind of strategic priority for the company and just didn't hear as much conversation about that on this call. So, is that still a key priority? Do you have any kind of target for that? And any additional words or strategy on how you plan to achieve it?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Hi, Mike. Let me start with your second question. Is product revenue growth a priority for the company? Absolutely. And some of the investments and realignments that we've made in the quarter are all about making sure that we maximize the resources that we're putting in front of the highest growth opportunity areas for the company. And essentially what we've done is, we're not changing our operating model. We have strong profitability and we continue to drive that. But we are moving significant investments toward these high-priority areas for product revenue growth. So that absolutely continues to be a priority.","In terms of your first question around addressable market and growth in the market, depending on what sort of market numbers you look at, I think the general view of the market is that over time, the hardware market is expected to decline slightly and sort of mid-single digit growth and then the virtual ADC market is going to experience very strong growth, both for on-prem environment and in public cloud environment. And depending on how these segments are accounted (38:00) et cetera, you end up with, in aggregate, sort of mid-single digit growth. I would say that, of course, our aim is over time to do better than the market in each of the segments in which we participate.","And then in security, there's a lot of security market segments over there. We participate in a few key segments. I mentioned the web applications firewall in our prepared remarks. That is absolutely a focus area for all of us. And we are seeing very strong attach rates for our WAF offerings, especially in our cloud implementations. And we're getting a number of customers that want to put WAFs in front of more and more of their applications. So that's a big driver, and I expect that market, the WAF market in particular to grow at more than double-digits over the next few years.","Michael E. Genovese - MKM Partners LLC","Very helpful. Thanks, Fran\u00e7ois.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Bhagavath from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. My question is around the guidance and how to extrapolate it from a product refresh point of view? And I think where I'm coming from is, given the guidance is weak versus expectations, I'd like to better understand which of the product portfolios in your view are outperforming or are underperforming versus your own expectations? And what's going on in the field? Like, what's the field asking for in terms of product refresh from F5? So, it helps us better understand the product cycle dynamics on a going-forward basis, at least, over the near-term. Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Hi, Vijay. I would say, the first is the areas that are outperforming for us, I think we mentioned, but in security, we have had a very strong year and a very strong quarter, both in enterprise and in service provider vertical, very strong demand there. Our virtual additions, again, very strong demand. You saw the growth numbers, 35% year over year. And then in the public cloud, we also are outperforming, more than doubling the business over the period. And specifically, I would say in the public cloud, we have a very strong security attach rates because folks, just (40:35) these applications. The problem application security in cloud becomes a real issue.","The one area where I would say we didn't see the lift that we expected to see this quarter is on our iSeries and appliance \u2013 actually in the total business for appliance. iSeries in terms of the refresh, it continues to track with the refresh we had last cycle. So the customer adoption is very strong. What we are seeing from the field, to your question on the field, is actually interesting in that not only we're involved in a number of refresh and upgrades, but we're also seeing new applications for iSeries, because iSeries has some capabilities specifically around encryption and SSL that are pretty unique. And so we're seeing customers in the field want to deploy iSeries in front of new applications, even within an existing customer.","But the one area where we feel we have underperformed relative to our own expectation this quarter is the total amount of business we expected to see from appliances as part of the refresh. We continue to think that the refresh is actually a driver of product revenue over the next few quarters, as we have more and more of our installed base on the iSeries. But for this quarter we're a little cautious, because we didn't see the lift we expected to see from appliances this quarter.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Certainly (42:00) Fran\u00e7ois, that's very helpful. Quickly as a follow-up, on the telco side, I'd like to get your views on how strategic is the telco piece of your business for you? And the reason I ask is telco spending has been quite weak. I mean, we saw Juniper's guidance yesterday. So any thoughts on becoming more of an enterprise-focused company versus having both enterprise and service provider in the portfolio? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you. Vijay, there are dynamics in the service provider environment that are good catalysts for F5 and we've seen that in 4G. We think we're going to see a potential, even bigger effect in 5G. A lot of these unlimited mobile data plans drive a lot of IP flows that need to be protected and need to be properly managed, and the scale, this is an area where the scale, the acceleration of our hardware, the performance of our security solutions, our carrier-grade firewall is very unique. And so, no, we consider the service provider segment of F5's business to be strategic, and in fact, in part of the realignment that we had in Q4, we enhanced the number of resources in that market because we feel that we are potentially under-distributed relative to the opportunity we have in the service provider space.","Vijay Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question on the line comes from Jayson Noland from Baird. Your line is now open.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. I wanted to come back to the WAF market. The Gartner report you mentioned has F5 in the upper right, but also makes a point to say the market is moving away from standalone appliances to cloud-based WAF models, which makes sense for the DDos applications. I guess, the question is why are you a winner with a shift like that and competitors out there like a Cloudflare or an Akamai or an AWS?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Well, so, on the WAF specifically, we do believe that it's moving to the cloud, and I think as I said, our attach rate as a data point for you, our attach rate with WAF solutions in the cloud is double the rate that we're seeing in on-premise applications. And so, that's why for us, cloud and WAF is actually a very interesting driver of growth.","In on-premise, we are also seeing potential for growth in the WAF space. One of the customers I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one of the large European banks, essentially told us that they have tested a number of WAF solutions, they've standardized on F5, largely because we have the best bot detection capabilities. We have excellent performance on false positive, which is a key criteria for them. We also have the ability to see a lot of the traffic, which allows us to implement a set of policy decisions for WAF that others cannot implement. And today, they see roughly 10% to 15% of their applications having a WAF in front of them, and they want to move to having 100% of their applications with a WAF, which is a great catalyst for us, both for their on-premise applications and some of them on the public cloud. So, we actually see the ability to have both present as a key advantage relative to some of the players you have mentioned.","And the last point I'd mention on that is that, we also have a hybrid offering with our \u2013 we just launched WAF Express on our Silverline capability. We have WAF on-premise, and the ability to offer both in a combination and to signal between the two is a very unique capability that F5 brings that we don't see any other pure cloud players offering, and that makes a big difference.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks for the color. And then a follow-up on U.S. Fed that was down by our math over 25% year-on-year into the fiscal year-end. Was that in line with expectations, and any additional color you can provide there?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","No, it wasn't. In fact, as we dissect it, we kind of see two dynamics in that area of our business, which we had a late approval of budget, which seem to impact the extensive process of getting POs through. And then unique to the Fed space is, once the fiscal year ends, the process has to start all over again. It's not like rolling into next quarter.","And then generally, just the buying environment seems \u2013 there's enough uncertainty there that we were seeing that impact the business. Hopefully, we will see things firm up there that we won't see a dynamic like that next year. But you're right in your percentage down, and we were disappointed in that.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, Andy.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jayson.","Operator","The next question on the line comes from Tal Liani from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Tal Liani - Bank of America","Hey, guys. Thanks very much. Maybe part of my question was answered, but I'm trying to understand, your commentary is very positive, but at the end of the day, product revenues were down and you also have a weak guidance, so there is an issue. And if you can elaborate on the weakness, where is it coming from? And what are you specifically doing in order to address the weakness?","And a related question is whether virtual solutions are deflationary to the market. If you're really strong, if you're selling \u2013 I think the first question asked it in a different way, but if you're going to grow dramatically, let's say in virtual solutions, does it mean it's going to be deflationary and the market may actually shrink for you or not? I'm trying to understand the dynamics there, too. Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Tal. Let me start with the second part of your question on whether virtual additions are deflationary overall. I would say that we believe over a period of time, the software, the virtual ADC market opens up more applications and growth in the market in terms of dollars, both in terms of volume and in terms of dollars in our market. And that's essentially because it allows us to get in front of way more applications in way more places to consume not just our traffic management capabilities, but also our security capabilities, our analytics capabilities, and a number of application services that we intend to bring to market. So, that's why, over a period of time, we think it creates growth in the market for us.","To your point on where there is a weakness, I think part of the reason you're hearing positive commentary from us is, we had a record revenue quarter and full-year in terms of revenue, and we're excited about areas of the business that are very strong, that bode very well for the long term of the business. In the quarter specifically, where we've seen some weakness and actually where we're being a bit prudent and cautious about Q1, is specifically in our appliance hardware business, where we expected to see more of a lift in Q4 in our total appliance sales than we have seen as part of our refresh. And I think that's the area of the business that is under-performing relative to our own expectations right now.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","And one thing I would add, Tal, is to the discussion around this transition to software impacting, we grew 35% this year, and interestingly enough, through the year our average order size has stayed pretty consistent. In fact, in Q4, it went up from last quarter, it was $115,000 up to $122,000. So we still see this dynamic where if they go with software, though the price point for the software is lower than maybe the appliances they were looking at, they tend to buy more instances of the virtual addition, and we see that offset. So and that's coming through in the average order size. So we'll see how this plays out as we go forward, but that's what we're seeing so far.","Tal Liani - Bank of America","And maybe just one follow up on the answer on the appliances. So, is that weakness going to stay? Meaning, there is a signal from the market that there is less demand for hardware and the market migrates to software. What drives the change? It may take you a few years to migrate the portfolio. At the end of the day, you're an appliance company, although you have virtual solutions, you're still an appliance company at the core. Most of revenues are probably coming from appliance sales and most of the installed base is appliance sales. So does it mean this quarter trends, does it mean that the transition may take a long time? Or what can you do in order to reverse the product trends?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So, Tal, I think couple of things. In terms of the product trends, number one for us is, as we've said, is doubling down in our investments, raising the intensities in these areas where we're seeing very strong growth, cloud, security, virtual additions. In terms of our appliance, the portion of our business that's appliance based, we've actually said we think we're going to perform. I mentioned earlier that the market was \u2013 overall, the market numbers were expected to decline over time at mid-single digit rates. We think we're going to perform better than market; a, because we're actually seeing great customer adoption of iSeries as part of the refresh; b, because we have very strong traction in the service provider space with both our appliance and chassis-based solutions; and c, because we believe that a number of our customers are deploying our hardware solutions in front of new applications. So we can't quantify that in terms of giving a specific guide on hardware for FY 2018, but we do think that we'll do better than the market with our appliance solutions.","Tal Liani - Bank of America","Got it. Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Operator, I think we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. The question is coming from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you for taking my question. I first just wanted to see if we could get a little bit of clarification on the segment trending. Historically, we've never seen a sequential decline in the December quarter of services. And I assume there are seasonal reasons in terms of your customer behavior, why services would grow sequentially in December. I'm just wondering whether or not that pattern is different this year and you would see services sequentially decline?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. You know, we don't generally break it out, but I wouldn't assume any different pattern than we've seen historically with services in December.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, I appreciate that. And then the bigger trending question I have is really the availability of two alternate options for enterprise customers. One is just what do you see is the impact of hyper-converged infrastructure? The enterprise is deploying that technology, how does that affect your market opportunities? And then the other one is Microsoft's Azure introduced load-balancing functions in September. So that's a new cloud option. Wondering how you see that affecting your overall business? Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Simon, I will take the Microsoft question, and then Ryan will address your question on hyper-conversion infrastructure. So Microsoft's load-balancing is no different from our perspective than other sort of load-balancing solutions that are offered by native cloud providers like Amazon, also Google. And our view on it is fairly simple. We think there is some basic applications and requirements that will take advantage of these solutions, but the market we go after for large enterprise customers, there are two things that we believe they'll continue to look for from F5.","Number one is, for a number of application, there is a feature of richness and depth, both in traffic management capabilities and in security capabilities that are quite differentiated as an offering from F5. And that's not going to change. And that's why we see such a strong win rate for us when our customers are migrating applications that we support to the cloud, it's because of that feature depth that they want.","And then the second aspect is cloud portability or multi-cloud capabilities. F5 offers in a number of ways we allow customers to deploy their applications across not a single public cloud, but multiple public cloud and\/or on-premise. Things like being able to manage their applications from a single pane of glass across all these environments. Things like the ability to manage licenses across multiple clouds. Things like that, things like having the same security posture across multiple clouds. All of those things are mission-critical for large enterprises, and this or that offering from a native cloud provider does not change that requirement. So, that's where we play and where we see a strong difference.","Ryan, and on the hyper-conversion infrastructure.","Ryan Kearny - F5 Networks, Inc.","Sure, Simon. Yes. Regarding hyper-conversed infrastructure, we actually partner with a variety of hyper-converged infrastructure vendors, and we can actually run adjacent to those technologies, because hyper-converged infrastructure still need availability, still need security, and still need services that we offer. So whether we're running adjacent to the converged infrastructure or within the converged infrastructure, we actually partner with many of those infrastructures. And it's basically a benefit to us and our technologies. So...","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc.","I'd like to thank everyone for participating today, and we look forward to talking to you again at the end of next quarter.

Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. Our second quarter of fiscal 2015 was marked by solid sales in North America, where we saw both a rebound in sales from large deals compared to our first fiscal quarter and record sales levels in our service provider vertical. These areas of strength were somewhat offset by some late quarter softness in sales in our EMEA and APAC theatres and Latin America region, likely impacted by the strengthening US dollar. ","Revenue and earnings both grew sequentially and year-over-year, with several factors contributing to strong profitability and cash flow from operations. Revenue of $472.1 million, grew 2% from the prior quarter and 12% year-over-year and was above the mid-point of our $465 million to $475 million guided range. GAAP EPS of $1.18 per share was above our guidance of $1.07 to $1.10 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.59 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.48 to $1.51 per share. The strength in EPS was driven by stronger-than-anticipated operating margin during the quarter, benefits to operating expenses and other income related to foreign currency and a more favorable tax rate than expected.","Product revenue of $244.1 million, up 1% sequentially and 8% year-over-year, represented 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $228 million, increased 3% sequentially, 17% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue. Revenue from the Americas accounted for 57% of total during the quarter, EMEA contributed 24%, APAC 14% and Japan 5%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas and EMEA grew revenue 14%, APAC 11% and Japan revenue was down 3%. Enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 24% and government sales were 12%, including 5% of total sales from US federal.","In Q2, we had four greater than 10% distributors; Westcon which accounted for 16.6%, Ingram Micro at 15.5%, Avnet representing 13.5% and Aero which accounted for 10.5%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses were $256.7 million at the low-end of guided range of $255 million to $264 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $223.1 million. GAAP operating margin was 28.1%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 36.6%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 37%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.6%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $142.3 million, driven by higher than expected profitability and stronger than expected collections in the current quarter. In Q2, we repurchased just under 1.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $113.29 for a total of $156.9 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.13 billion in cash and investments. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program. DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories were $29.3 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.2 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year-over-year to $720.6 million. We ended the quarter with 4,035 employees, an increase of 90 from the prior quarter.","Now for the Q3 outlook. In keeping with recent historical patterns, ongoing strength of our major drivers, and a robust pipeline, we anticipate continued sales momentum with sequential and year-over-year growth in the second half of fiscal 2015. That said, we believe the possible continued impact of foreign currency should be considered as we move into Q3.","With that in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 is $475 million to $485 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range.","We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $257 million to $266 million. This includes approximately $34.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%.","Our GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.57 to $1.60 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 100 to 125 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $170 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy and good afternoon everyone. Before I go on to talk about Q2 results and Q3 outlook, I just want to say a few opening remarks on the organizational announcement that we released today.","Firstly, I\u2019d like to congratulate Manny Rivelo on his appointment as President and CEO of F5 effective on July the 1st this year. When I announced my intention to retire on October last year, I stated that a key priority would be to work closely with our board to have a smooth and effective transition plan for my successor.","I will work with Manny and the F5 executive team over the next couple of months to ensure a smooth and efficient handover of responsibilities and then assume the position of Non-Executive Chairman of the F5 board. Al Higginson, who has been our Non-Executive Chairman for the last 11 years, will assume the position of Lead Independent Director.","I am confident that Manny\u2019s understanding of technology trends, his strategic vision, operational experience and tremendous culture fit with the F5 values will ensure that F5 continues to have a fantastic future and I\u2019m sure you will join me in wishing him great success in his new role.","Okay, let\u2019s talk about our Q2 performance and our outlook for Q3 and beyond. Overall, I was pleased with our performance in Q2. From a sales perspective, the Americas region had a very solid quarter with double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth, delivering their internal forecast. In particular, sales from million-dollar plus deals in Q2 increased significantly over Q1 and this was a significant factor in the Americas region\u2019s strong results.","The EMEA region continued to deliver year-over-year sales booking growth, though the growth was not as strong as we have seen in previous quarters and was below our internal forecasts. Sales in our APAC region were also below our initial forecast and sales in Japan were slightly above the forecast.","Our services business continued to deliver solid results and excellent profitability along with a healthy increase in deferred revenue, which is now approximately $721 million, up 6% sequentially, which should bode well for future business. From a software perspective, the latest industry analyst report show us as a clear market leader in the virtual edition ADC market, driven by our ability to provide us solutions as virtual software offerings -- software only offerings across all the major hypervisors and a unique orchestration functionality in BIG IQ to enable customers to move to software-defined data centers and NFV architectures.","Also, the combination of GBB pricing, virtual ADC sales, and a solid attach rate of software modules continue to result in solid software growth. We had a number of large project wins with our security solutions last quarter. And in our Q1 call three months ago, I mentioned that we had won a large scale AFM Gi firewall project in a Tier 1 service provider in North America. This project is now in production. ","We received more orders last quarter as the customer rolls out more of the Gi firewall solution throughout their network, and we expect to see continuing business from this project during this fiscal year and in fiscal 2016. ","We also plan to replicate the success wherever possible in the overall service provider market. We continue to believe that our security business will be a largest growth driver. We expect to see strong demand for our increasing portfolio of security solutions as customers look to adopt hybrid architectures, deploying applications both in premise and in the cloud.","As you will recall, we launched our Silverline hybrid application strategy in November with the initial launch, including our subscription based DDoS service and our anti-malware and phishing protection service. We extended our Silverline services platform a couple of weeks ago with our industry leading WAP capabilities.","As the latest addition to F5 Silverline\u2019s cloud-based application services platform, the new WAP offering is built on our industry-leading ASM solution. We now offer our customers leading WAP services in both on-premise and subscription-based cloud offerings. This new cloud offering provides both ease and speed of deployment and allows organizations to confidently incorporate cloud resources, while protecting apps and data from increasingly sophisticated security attacks, risks and vulnerabilities.","I was very pleased with the progress we made on our strategic initiatives in the service provider market last quarter. We had a strong presence at Mobile World Congress, where we showcased NFV solutions that power and secure service provider networks.","Sales in the service provider market were very solid last quarter with sales bookings at a record high. The America regions, in particular, had a very solid quarter with several wins with the Tier 1 service providers as well as a number of competitive wins in the cable companies. We won several competitive replacements last quarter, including the Gi firewall project I mentioned earlier, and we had some solid wins with our traffic to LTE solution, including license upgrades as LTE traffic increased in the installed base. Also Gi consolidation traffic steering optimization also continue to be good drivers for us in the service provider market.","As I mentioned last quarter, our hybrid application services based on our Synthesis architecture and Silverline cloud services is resonating really well with our customers and partners. This strategy combined with the strength of our partner ecosystem in areas like SPN provide F5 with the opportunity to play a very strategic role as customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures.","Also, our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn significantly expands our addressable market and increases the types of revenue streams available to our sales force and partner channel.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. Although we faced some potential headwinds as a result of the currency movements in some regions, especially EMEA, I was very pleased with the positive rebound we experienced with the revenue from million-dollar plus deals and I continue to believe that the fundamental drivers of our business remain robust.","We remain committed to plan for growth in our business by investing in headcount and infrastructure moving forward, whilst delivering world-class operating margins. I believe that our existing product portfolio, our hybrid applications services strategy and our product roadmap are not only in-line with customer and market trends, but also key to enabling those trends.","In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter.","Before we move over to Q&A, I\u2019ll hand over to Manny to give you his thoughts on F5\u2019s opportunities looking forward and talk briefly about our strategic initiatives.","Manuel Rivelo","Thank you, John. Before I say a few words on our vision and strategy, I would like to say that this is a very exciting time to be part of F5 and when I look across the company, I see a collaborative and productive team all aligned to the common goal of providing fast, secure and available applications to anyone at any time on any device. That alignment and strategy and purpose is a testament to the company you built and the culture of innovation and respect you champion [ph].","Our leadership team, the Board and I, thank you for your dedication and commitment to excellence. We have something truly special here and I am honored to be given the opportunity to lead it into its next era.","Regarding our vision, over the past years, F5 has evolved beyond the traditional data center routes to include a robust hybrid products and services portfolio including scale-out virtual editions, born-in-the-cloud products and as-a-service solutions, all complementing our market-leading ADC technology. In addition, our innovative approach towards protecting applications has made F5 a logical addition to many companies\u2019 security posture.","And lastly, our broadened ecosystem of technology partners will help us deliver our synthesis architecture to meet the ever-increasing SDN, NFV cloud and security applications opportunities. In partnership with our leadership team, we will continue to evolve the company to ensure F5 can deliver application services in the way that makes the most business sense to our customers, whether that\u2019s on-premise, in-the-cloud or on-demand and always with the confidence that F5 is defending those applications.","Lastly, our most important asset is our people. I will lead in a collaborative, transparent and respectful way. In my first month as CEO, I\u2019m dedicated to listening to our employees to hearing what motivates them and to hear about their ideas on how to make F5 even a better place to work and also how best to serve our customers.","I am excited to get started in this new role and I want to express my gratitude to John and the board for their vote of confidence. ","And I will turn the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jason Ader, William Blair. Your line is open.","Jason Ader","Thank you, and my congratulations to you Manny and thanks, John for all the great years. The questions I have, first, I just wanted to get a sense of, Andy maybe for you, linearity in the quarter. And then secondly, maybe for Manny, I know soft ADCs are not a big percentage of sales today. You just \u2013 virtual ADCs that you do refer to them just now, if the market pivots faster than expected to virtual ADCs, how do you see that affecting F5\u2019s business and particularly the model?","Andy Reinland","Yeah, so first on the linearity, Jason, so it was more back-end loaded than we normally see in a Q3, but it wasn\u2019t like a record, right. Really more telling was my comments on how near the end of the quarter, particularly in EMEA, APAC and Latin America, we saw sales kind of drop off and that\u2019s what has led us to deeper look around the foreign currency elements of this, which we think are tied there. We\u2019ve been talking with the sales teams, looking at specific deals where we think that was an impact and that\u2019s really how the quarter laid out linearity-wise and has led us to this look at the foreign currency and a little bit of a cautious approach around that.","Manuel Rivelo","Yeah, let me just add some to virtual ADCs. So actually, we see as it being just complementary. We are seeing actually our virtual ADCs grow at a nice clip over the last couple of quarters and really over the last couple of years, but what we are seeing is two trends. One is that new applications are getting virtual ADCs, meaning in today\u2019s architecture where either applications are moving to the cloud or they are moving to a much more software defined data center, we are seeing those virtual ADCs take over.","However, in those same instances, customers are looking for traditional hardware solutions in what we tend to call internally a two-tier architecture, meaning the exterior tier of the data center is usually hardware and in that level, we provide services with our custom-built hardware that provides high throughput, high performance. And then we apply virtual, if you will, ADCs at the application layer on the back-end of the tier. So we think it\u2019s actually complementary. We think that to succeed in the market, you need both the hardware components and the software components working in tandem, providing both on-prem and off-prem solutions.","Jason Ader","So you don\u2019t see any cannibalization or ASP pressure in the business from it?","Manuel Rivelo","No, not at the current time, not at all.","Jason Ader","Thank you.","John McAdam","Next question?","Operator","The next question comes from Amitabh Passi, UBS. Your line is open.","Amitabh Passi","Hi, thank you, guys. John, I guess the first question for you, the strength in the service provider vertical, you mentioned North America. Was this again you starting to see the benefit of the security win you talked about? Can you just maybe provide a little more insight into just sort of the service provider trends by geography?","John McAdam","Yes. In service provider North America, it was across the board actually and all the tier 1s and I mentioned competitive wins in the cable company. So, yes, security was a big factor, so was traffic steering, Gi consolidation. It was a pretty well rounded quarter there. Sales in APAC weren\u2019t quite strong, we had a very difficult comparison from a year ago where they had very significant growth. Same in Japan, it was a little bit late [ph] again with a very, very big win from one of the Japanese tier 1s last year. So that was doing a little bit. I don't actually have the information on EMEA. I think it was\u2026","Andy Reinland","EMEA was relatively flat, they came in line where we expected.","Amitabh Passi","And then maybe just as a quick follow-up, just on your GBB program, can you give us a sense where are we, what sorts of attach rates are you getting, do you think you\u2019re past sort of the sweet spot of the acceleration or the momentum you saw last year, just any help there would be highly appreciated?","John McAdam","Absolutely. GBB was interesting actually last quarter, in a sense that, well, first of all, a great majority is still going to best. Actually, I think it may even be a record percentage going to best, actually either went for better or best. It was as much as 80% actually. Interestingly enough, it was very solid in the Americas. In North America, in particular, it was actually very solid with pretty significant growth. ","We did see a little bit of deceleration in APAC and EMEA, which is actually somewhat counterintuitive, because they were slower to pick up the GBB process. I actually view that as good news, because we think, first of all, that\u2019s not a trend that will continue because there is a lot of runway in EMEA and APAC and it was probably linked to the exchange issue, the foreign currency issue which was the bigger picture with the business. So very happy with what happened in North America, and let me say, with still significant revenue and very material part of the product revenue.","Amitabh Passi","Excellent. Thank you, guys. I will step back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. Next question, George Notter, Jefferies. Your line is open.","George Notter","Hi. Thanks very much guys. I wanted to follow up on the currency discussion, I guess I'm trying to get a better handle, any sense for how much of an impact you guys might have felt because of currency this quarter, how much did currency factor into your guidance for next quarter. And then can you remind us how much of the business is US dollar or US dollar linked and to the extent that you see pressure, does that wind up kind of falling through to F5? Is that more felt at the channel level, any more flavor on the whole currency issue would be great? Thanks.","John McAdam","Yeah. This is John. We pertain to talk to face-to-face and\/or video with our sales management in Latin America as well as in EMEA and really drill down on it. EMEA is \u2013 to actually give you a number is difficult. It really is, because if you think of some of the things that we see when you get these currency issues, especially when they are fluctuating quite significantly, your VAR channel [ph] who could make the mistake of taking an order and lose money almost for the time that that order is being paid for by the end-user customer. So that tends to make them shy and we definitely got that feedback from South America. We definitely got that.","We expect that similar things happened in EMEA, but it's a little bit too early to actually give you a number, but we do -- given what we saw as Andy mentioned at the end of the quarter in terms of the slip, which we don't really see that often at all from those regions, we're pretty sure that's got to linked to the foreign currency, the exchange rate I should say.","George Notter","Got it. And then, any sense for how much that is incorporated into the next quarter's guidance?","John McAdam","Well, hopefully adequately, that's what we try to do.","George Notter","Let me ask you this way. What percentage of the deals that you see do you think the currency issue kind of rears up in?","John McAdam","Yeah. It\u2019s hard to -- I mean, what we tend to do \u2013 what do we tend to when we've seen issues like this in the past, macro issues like in the past, we basically go back to the roots of looking at the close rate percentages and hopefully as I say, we've adopted an appropriately conservative, but realistic close rate.","George Notter","Got it, okay. Thank you.","John McAdam","Thanks.","Operator","Next question, Michael Genovese, MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Michael Genovese","Great, thanks very much. I wanted to ask about sales taxes for bundles like the Good, Better, Best. If those can be used to somehow outgrow the overall growth rate of the ADC market and what do you think, what's your current view on what the growth rate of the ADC market is and if you could just talk about how do you use the penetration of Good, Better, Best, as you try to outgrow that overall number?","Manuel Rivelo","So Michael, this is Manny, let me try to answer that question. So, yeah, we believe that GBB is transforming the ADC market, and the growth rate of the overall ADC market and the rationale for that is because, what we are doing is, consolidating a set of services; layer four through seven service inside a product. The traditional ADC product itself was predominantly started out being a load balancer in the early days, if you go back a decade or so ago and since then, we've incorporated into that product, firewall technology, Secure Web Gate technologies, service provider technologies, the list goes on and on, that's part of the value proposition if they are a traffic management operating system or big IP that we bring to the market.","So by looking at that, we think the addressable market of our solutions is about $12 billion opportunity for us. That's what we talked about at the Analyst Conference last November, we are tracking to that, and we monitor that very closely. If you look at just the ADC market, right, and the old definition, that would be about a $4 billion market, so we think we've added to the new definition, approximately $8 billion of incremental TAM.","Michael Genovese","And do you have a view just on the growth rate of the traditional ADC market, I guess the industry analysts are probably counting it, but are there any of those numbers that you endorse?","John McAdam","This is John, we\u2019re not trying to doubt that, because what we\u2019re -- really what we're doing is, we're basically making sure that we get into a big number of markets, not only security, so the more we\u2019re successful in security and we feel good about our progress, the more we'll get into that faster growing market. I could give you a number on security but, I don't want to, that's going to be misleading, because we need -- it needs to be a bigger percentage of our business, it's growing and so we -- that's our strategy, so rather than giving you just one number of the ADC market, remember, we are using ADC to get into other markets, hopefully fast moving ones like mobile traffic and security.","Michael Genovese","Excellent. Thanks for allowing the question and congratulation to both of you.","John McAdam","Thanks.","Operator","Next question, Mark Kelleher, D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Mark Kelleher","Great, thanks for taking the questions. Just want to look at the million dollar deals, you said those increased significantly in the quarter, that's great. What's your anticipation as we move into the next quarter, does that momentum continue, do we make up the -- does the components of that guidance make up smaller deals, what's your thought there?","John McAdam","This is John, I think what we saw there was, I think we got proved right. In last quarter's call, we said we believe that the reduction was due to the Q4 push, emptying the pipeline and I think we're back to normality in the million dollar deals, and I obviously, time will tell that, but that's how we feel when we look at the pipeline and listen to the quarterly business reviews on the, you know, what's being forecast by the sales force. But let me remind you because I'm not going to be here is that Q1 next year, I think you're going to see a very similar scenario.","Mark Kelleher","Okay. And just as a follow-up or maybe a second question, the breakout between product revenue and service revenue, product has been sort of decelerating with service revenue growing quite rapidly, do you see that dynamic continuing, what's the shift or the sales model shift, is that going to continue to push towards service model and subscription revenue, just some thoughts on the growth of product revenue would be great?","Andy Reinland","Yeah, when we\u2019re looking today at that mix between product and service, I really think it's more, the service tends to trail product, right, so we're seeing a lot of good service growth off of last year's tremendous product growth, and if we don't get product reaccelerating again, we'll probably see service start to slow down over a longer period of time. So that's the dynamic there, but nothing --","John McAdam","And if you look at, obviously product revenue acceleration is always going to be a major financial goal, as we -- the rest of the business I think in good shape in terms of profit, et cetera. So that's always a thing, and the two big areas there are service provider and security, and I have to make sure both. And there is going to be other areas where we see growth areas, obviously subscription is one where, it will be a while before we see the growth, but once we see it, it keeps on giving, but you know, number one focus, product revenue growth, but meanwhile, we\u2019re also creating this other channel using subscription services in Silverline to make sure that we\u2019ve got good recurring revenue at a product level as well as a service.","Andy Reinland","And just for clarity, in case I missed something there, our subscription revenue that comes from the Silverline service goes into our product revenue, so it will be a part of that. And the interesting metric that as it gets more meaningful that we\u2019ll start to look at more closely is, deferred revenue and the growth there obviously, because that\u2019s a setup for future revenue. So, we\u2019ll talk about more -- that more in future quarters as it becomes more meaningful.","Mark Kelleher","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Next question from Rod Hall, JPMC. Your line is open.","Rod Hall","Yeah, hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the currency question, George had asked you guys what the dollar rate or dollar exposure is versus foreign currency, and I think you guys price in local currency external for the US, but just wanted to double-check that and then have a follow-up.","Andy Reinland","Yeah, so, actually, almost all of our sales are in US dollar, right, and that goes to the distributor and then converts to local currency at that point, right, which is why John was taking about you know, we work with the channel on these currency issues and historically tended to have addressed them on a deal-by-deal basis. So far with what we\u2019re hearing, we think that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to continue but we\u2019ll see.","Rod Hall","And you guys -- I guess the follow-up then Andy is, given that, are you -- so, you haven\u2019t accelerated price decline in dollars to try to compensate for the local currency fluctuations at least in some of the regions, where currencies are really badly impacted like Brazil and Russia and so on, or have you not really moved to do that sort of thing yet?","Andy Reinland","Yeah, we haven\u2019t -- we\u2019ve not responded with lowering pricing and never really have and probably won\u2019t. I think we\u2019ll be addressing it through our discounting process on a deal-by-deal basis working with our channel partners as the deals merit and they come to us and we decide to figure out how to work it together so we win.","Rod Hall","Okay. And then -- I just -- I also, on services, if I can follow-up on, John, you talked about managed or consulting services, people come at you guys and asking you to do more and more of this. Is there any \u2013 do you have an ability to quantify that for us, or give us some idea for how that part of services is growing for you, I think it still is growing?","Edward Eames","This is Julian. That part of the services business is growing slightly faster than the maintenance support business, but over the course of the last 18 months, we\u2019ve been employing strategies of working with our sales partners and expanding their capabilities to the point that we sub-contract to those people as well, and also providing more of that consulting service remotely rather than going to site all the time. Always focused on product sales, but at the same time, trying to maintain better margins, which is what we\u2019ve done over the past year.","Operator","Okay, we\u2019ll move on to next question. Jeff Kvaal with Northland Capital, your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal","Yes, gentlemen, thank you very much and let me add to my congratulations to those who\u2019ve come before me. I look forward to working with you Manny, and John, I don\u2019t look forward to not working with you I guess is the way I would put it. ","Okay, could I ask, the product revenue growth, obviously we\u2019ve been watching this for many years and asking about it every quarter, looks like it may be flat to down again in the next quarter. How long do you think it may be before the current -- let\u2019s assume that the currency normalizes at these levels, how long do you think it might be before the product revenue would start to drift back up?","John McAdam","This is John, and I\u2019m going to make an excuse, and lead with that, but given what we saw in America last quarter, where we had really solid rebound, not just in the million dollar deals, but the actual sales, if we have not seen those -- this is our opinion there, if we haven\u2019t seen those currency, it would be \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be answering this question right now. So, we have to balance that. But the key for us is to keep focused on creating technology and security and the big drivers that we see, making sure that we execute on areas like the ACE opportunity, which we still believe is there, and if there is a number of deals going this quarter, then we will see results. That\u2019s our focus, but meanwhile, there are some headwinds in between, obviously macro.","Manuel Rivelo","And what I will add to that is, we are continuing our innovation cycle and we will see specifically coming out later this quarter our next release of technology and products into the market segment. So actually, it\u2019s the quarter after, I apologize, Q4 that you will see that innovation come out. So, you will expect to see from us continuing to add innovation on two releases, predominantly a year, and that will continue to build TAM for us in new products in the market.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay. Well, that leads me into new direction, I guess. I mean, do you think it is possible that some of the revenue that you might have liked to have seen in the March quarter and the June quarter did not arrive for some other reason and maybe that\u2019s because they are expecting some of these product refreshes or maybe it\u2019s just the tough comps or what have you? Are there other things going on possibly beyond the currency?","John McAdam","I don\u2019t think so, this is John. I mean, well, first of all, and we had this from our sales force -- sales management in North America and EMEA this week, I mean, they were very optimistic about our competitive position, so we don\u2019t see that at all right now. We think we\u2019ve got a great area there and we will continue, and it\u2019s up to us to keep driving those solutions and innovation that Manny talked about and product revenue will fall.","Manuel Rivelo","And just to clarify, most of the innovation we are talking about here is not physical hardware, it\u2019s actually software innovation, so customers can upgrade to that innovation, specifically as our -- within our support capabilities. We offer that opportunity to move toward \u2013 through the most recent software cycle. So we are not penalized by any means by not having the technology today, and when the additional software functionality becomes available, they will do an upgrade.","Jeff Kvaal","Thank you, gentlemen.","John McAdam","Thank you.","Operator","Next question, Rohit Chopra, your line is open.","Rohit Chopra","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And congratulations, John and Manny. I had a question again just about the end of the quarter and the softness, and I know you mentioned currency. But did you see anything related to competition, I know there is a few competitors that are out there who are a little bit desperate of maybe they were accounting for the weakness at the end of the quarter? Maybe that\u2019s the first question.","And the other question I had, and John, maybe you could help me out on this one, but it comes back to product growth and services growth, is foreign -- what\u2019s the make-up of the services for the new ones or serviced, maintenance contract, are they mostly foreign? And the reason I am asking is, maybe the foreign buyer, are they sort of holding off on maybe some upgrades or some new purchases and they are just sticking with their existing solution for a little bit longer, just given the currency movement. Have you looked at that?","John McAdam","Yeah. Let Julian answer the services thing, because I think definitely the way you have asked the question is about the situation and then we will talk about the competitors.","Edward Eames","So on the services, maintenance, renewals, we had a strong quarter across the globe. The proportions really mirror the product revenue portions from the past that we have talked about, roughly just under 60% North America and the rest of the world the rest. EMEA and North America were our two outstanding performers, there are really no effect whatsoever in this regard.","Manuel Rivelo","And Rohit, just to add around the market share, so over the course of last year, we grew market share and we felt really good about that taking our leadership, while maintaining leadership position in the total market, we are also taking a leadership position in the software-only market. We anticipate this quarter that we will gain market share across the board. Our competitors continue to be Citrix, A10, Radware, those are the primary competitors we see out there. And our selling motions, our win rate in the field, everything is favorable, very favorable, so we expect another year of continuing to gain market share.","Rohit Chopra","Okay. Can I just ask a quick follow-up, Manny, you didn\u2019t seem like when you had your part of the presentation that there was going to be anything different, but if John wasn\u2019t in the room, what would you change?","A - Manuel Rivelo","Oh, John is in the room \u2013 oh, he is not there. I think for us, really I have taken this question a couple of times, where I think the focus is going to be short-termish, first of all, the transition. There is no question about \u2013 we\u2019re going through a quarter here, where we are transitioning, we want to make sure that we continue to execute our financial model as well as all of our customer commitments. But what we are aggressively also working internally is our FY16 and beyond strategy. ","And that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to balance not only the short-term opportunities we have, but also the long-term opportunities to be able to succeed. And as we evaluate that, you\u2019ll see us rolling that out at the Analyst Day in November just like we always do what our strategy is. There are some areas there that we\u2019re going to double-down and accelerate, some of those are probably pretty obvious, things like security, which we have a lot of traction and there is other areas where we might consider pulling back a little bit on the investments just to capitalize on those new areas. And that\u2019s the area that we\u2019ll be evaluating over the course of the next quarter or two. ","Rohit Chopra","Thanks, Manny and John. I appreciate it.","Manuel Rivelo","Thank you.","John McAdam","Thank you.","John Eldridge","Brian, this is John Eldridge. We\u2019re going to take two more calls and then wrap it up.","Operator","Okay. Next question, Paul Silverstein, Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Paul Silverstein","All right, thanks guys. I recognize you\u2019ve been asked the question six ways to Sunday, so that said, going back to currency for one minute, and I suspect it\u2019s probably impossible to tell, but John, Andy, Manny, have you seen with respect to US-based customers, larger customers who do business overseas, where they too have been impacted perhaps to one [indiscernible] or another in terms of a decrease in revenue over the last nine months of depreciation of the dollar? ","Have you seen any sign that they\u2019re cutting back on their IT purchases and historically it\u2019s been the case, the first thing that gets cut is networking, are there any signs of that? And then on the Gi firewall deal that you all called out, in terms of the dollar contribution, can you give us some sense of the magnitude and I heard you say that you expect this continue through \u201916, but I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense of the concentration risk from that one deal?","John McAdam","Okay. So, let me answer that as well as in my mind. So, I think in the last call, I talked about a couple of transactions more than a million. We talked about another transaction happening this quarter, millions plus. That\u2019s the type of, we expect -- and remember this is a rollout, this is not something that you know we expect to see that throughout the fiscal. I am not saying every quarter we\u2019ll see it, I am not committing that, but we expect to see that type of transaction happening as they roll out the Gi firewall to the network. And another thing I said was it through -- we think over through 2016. So, we don\u2019t see any concentration, actually almost the opposite. And the main thing we want to do actually is make it work which we\u2019re very happy with the way it\u2019s gone into production and also to replicate it in the other --","Manuel Rivelo","Let me just add something to that. Although we talked about that one transaction, we\u2019ve also seen other Gi firewall deals that we\u2019ve won, they tend to be much more in the software space, NFV-type projects from that implementation point of view and those are material also in size. So it\u2019s not concentrated as per one account. We\u2019re seeing that traction across various different service providers, some which are going to hardware appliances and some which are going to the software architectures.","Andy Reinland","Sorry. To your initial question about US companies being impacted in some way if they do multinational business, where we would hear that is through the channel at our sales force that services those accounts and even anecdotally, we\u2019re not getting any indication of that that would give us concern there with the US companies doing business overseas.","Paul Silverstein","So, all the near-term we\u2019ve been seeing, you\u2019d attribute to the dollar impact on overseas business, not US?","Andy Reinland","Yeah. And then on the flip side, you look at EPS and saw the benefit in our EPS from foreign currency.","Paul Silverstein","All right. One quick follow-up, Andy I trust, I know you\u2019re saying that the virtual editions are incremental, not cannibalistic, but I also if I recall historic when you said on the issue that virtual editions go out about 80% of the price of a hardware with a wash to the bottom line, that it\u2019s a deal better or worse, does that still hold?","Andy Reinland","Yeah. I mean what we\u2019ve seen historically, if you look at how we price the virtual editions, it\u2019s roughly $12,000, which is 80% of our entry-level box, which is about $15,000, which has 20% margin. So, the entry-level, it's kind of a wash, but what we\u2019ve seen to-date is that those deals tend to be larger because they choose to go with a much more horizontal type approach, which pushes them towards many more instances and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen. So, not saying that it won\u2019t change as things evolve, but at least today that's where we\u2019re at.","Manuel Rivelo","I think just to add some additional context to that, this is Manny, the way to think about it is when we tend to sell the virtual editions, they tend to go out one per application. Sometimes when the hardware is sold, it's many applications from one appliance. So, you\u2019re seeing it picked up in volume, which is Andy\u2019s point versus concentration at the appliance level. So it tends to be almost a wash.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Last question today then comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani, Stifel. Your line is open.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Thanks so much. Let me add my congratulations to both Manny and John. Two quick questions. John, just on the currency issue, just wanted to get a flavor, when you are seeing these issues, are they coming in the form of a lower deal size? Are the deals getting pushed out? Any color over there would be helpful.","And then on Cisco ACE, I know you mentioned it briefly, but are you still seeing a lot of opportunities out there, or is this starting to get a little bit mature since you have been sort of attacking that installed base for well over a year now? Thanks.","John McAdam","Yeah, so on the deal size, we have seen some of that, and again, it\u2019s anecdotal in the sense, it\u2019s coming from sales management as they are looking and thinking, what happens here, we forecast a number and that towards the end, we missed them, we don\u2019t often do that.","And then when you look at some of the actual orders especially towards the end of the fiscal quarter, I should say, we did see some reduction on add-ons coming. So we did see some of that happening. In other words, the customer really needs the basic optimization and steering, but maybe doesn\u2019t opt for an additional module, it was a bit of that one or again, have to actually come up with a specific number on that, but we did see some of that. ","And then ACE, ACE, we think we\u2019ve still got a very big opportunity there. I mentioned I think just briefly during the call that when we went through the America\u2019s QVR this week on Monday, we went through in detail and it was a bunch of fairly big transactions that we\u2019re forecasting to close our ACE opportunities. And then of course, remember that once we do that, if we get a big transaction, it tends to mean it\u2019s a bigger company, we sell security, we sell more add-ons, we sell more into the account and moved up, very good example of that.","So yeah, I think it\u2019s still a very, very good opportunity for us and we are focused on it and that\u2019s why we keep measuring it and looking at it each quarter.","Sanjiv Wadhwani","Got it. Thank you.","John McAdam","Thank you.","John Eldridge","All right. Well, thank you all for joining us for this call and rest assured, we are going to keep our heads down and do our best to bring in a good quarter. We will talk to you all again at the end of Q3.","Operator","Okay, thank you. Then that does conclude the call for today.

For FQ1 2012 F5 achieved sequential revenue gains and solid year-over-year growth exceeding both revenue and earnings guidance. Revenue of $322.4 million which exceeded the high end of our $315 million to $320 million guided range grew 2.5% from the prior quarter and 20% year-over-year.","GAAP EPS of $.83 per diluted share was above our guided range of $.79 to $.81. Excluding stock based compensation expense, Non-GAAP EPS of $1.03 per diluted share was also above our guided range of $.99 to $1.01.","Product revenue of $196.6 million grew 15% year-over-year and represented 61% of total revenue. Service revenue of $125.9 million grew 29% year-over-year and accounted for 39% of total revenue. Book to bill for the quarter was greater than one.","On a geographic basis all regions contributed to the company\u2019s solid year-over-year growth. Accounting for 59% of the total, revenue from the Americas grew 20% from FQ1 2011.","EMEA, which represented 21% of revenue grew 14% from Q1 of last year. APAC accounted for 14% of revenue and grew 28% year-over-year. And Japan contributed 6% of revenue, a 22% increase year-over-year.","During Q1 our application delivery networking business contributed $316.9 million. This compares to $307.3 million in Q4 and $261.7 million in Q1 a year ago.","Revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $5.5 million compares to $7.3 million in Q4 and $7.2 million in Q1 of last year.","Telco was our strongest vertical in Q1 representing 23% of total sales. Financial was 21%, technology 17% and government was 9% including US Federal which accounted for 4% of the total.","In Q1 we had two greater than 10% distributors, Avnet which represented 17.9% of total revenue and Engro Micro which accounted for 13.7%.","Driven by exceptional strength and software sales, our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.8%. Excluding approximately $2.5 million of stock based compensation expense, non-GAAP gross margin was 83.5%.","GAAP operating expenses of $167 million were above our target range of $161 million to $165 million. Excluding $19.6 million of stock based compensation expense, non-GAAP operating expenses were $147.5 million.","GAAP operating margin was 30.9%. Our Non-GAAP operating margin, which excludes stock based compensation expense, was 37.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 34.6%. Excluding stock based compensation our Non-GAAP effective tax rate was 33.6%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $131.9 million contributing to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $126 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.9 million and depreciation and amortization expense was $5.8 million.","ESO at the end of Q1 was 52 days. Inventories were $17.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% sequentially to $380 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately 2615 employees, an increase of 125 from the prior quarter.","During Q1 we repurchased approximately 320,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $107.65 per share for a total of $34 million. Approximately $332 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.","Looking ahead to Q2, based on our solid year-over-year growth, the strength of our pipeline and the productivity of our sales organization, we believe F5 will continue to generate sequential revenue growth throughout fiscal 2012. We remain confident in achieving revenue growth of at least 20% for fiscal year 2012 and expect to see acceleration in year-over-year product revenue growth in the current quarter.","Our revenue target for FQ2 of 2012 is $332 million to $337 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 82% to 83% range; including approximately $2.5 million of stock based compensation expense.

We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $19 million to $21 million. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $100 million reflecting a large sequential increase in our federal tax payments as is customary in our FQ2.","With that I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks Andy and good afternoon everyone. I was very pleased with our Q1 results, which have given us a sold start to fiscal 2012. All major regions may have to exceed our internal sales forecast. From a sales perspective, North America produced solid year-over-year growth. Our relatively weak performance in our federal business was more than compensated for by strong performances in both our North American enterprise and service provider businesses.","I was also pleased with our results in APAC and EMEA and especially in Japan where we continue to see improvement in deal sizes and the current penetration. Our services business had another excellent quarter exceeding both revenue and profit goals as well as coercing a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $37 million.","Sales of the new mid-range VIPRION 2400 products were very strong in the quarter and sales from the entire VIPRION family almost tripled from a year ago. The combination of VIPRION sales and the increase in our software module attach rate have been major factors in obtaining deal sizes at record levels.","TMOS Version 11 continues to gain traction with a lot of interest in features like VCMP for multiple software licenses and IOPS for application optimization and deployment.","The IOP functionality in V11 is proving to be very popular with our customers. Especially for those deploying Microsoft\u2019s Exchange and SharePoint applications. One example of the IOPS is a customer who prior to the introduction of IOPs needed a full week to set up an exchange environment within the network. By using an IOP the same customer has now reduced the set-up time to only five minutes. IOPs give our customers the ability to access the sole capabilities in part of our products which we believe will generate additional deployment and sales opportunities.","We also opened a second technology center in London during the quarter to compliment our facility in Seattle. F5 Technology centers enable our customers and perspective customers to see how F5\u2019s products will operate in their own networking environment.","I\u2019m very pleased with the number of customer engagements that have already occurred at the London technology center and I believe this is a great showcase for (inaudible) and effectiveness of our solutions. IOPs are the most frequently requested demo from people visiting the technology centers.","In addition to the growth we have enjoyed with our hardware based solutions I\u2019m also very pleased with the sales of software only virtualizations of our products, which have increased 149% year-over-year. F5 has introduced the most comprehensive set of virtual product additions in the market and I believe this has enabled us to significantly expand our addressable market and offer new and exciting capabilities to our customer base.","We also saw strong field momentum with our security products in the quarter. Our application firewall solution, the ASM module, had its best ever quarter and we also experienced good sequential growth with our Edge Gateway and APM access solutions. We achieved some important milestones with our security strategy last quarter including ICSE network firewalls application for TMOS Version 11. F5 was also positioned in the leaders quadroon of Gartner\u2019s Magic quadrant for SSLVPNs.","You may also have seen our recent press release announcing that our big AP edge client has the industries\u2019 first SSLVPN solution that provides comprehensive security and mobile access for all devices running Android 4.X operating systems.","F53 downloadable client enhances more values of productivity by providing accelerated client access to corporate resources via a full SSLVPN connection. We have already announced similar functionality for the Apple IOS iPhone environment.","TMOS Version 11.1 was released in the quarter and included a number of features specifically designed for the security market under Telco and service provider customers. Version 11.1 also included a trial version of our VPI functionality.","Over the next few quarters we will be expanding these features to include full VPI capability, advanced Telco oriented iRules, DNS cashing and other features requested by our Telco and service provider customers.","Upcoming product releases includes the new Senator Blade for the VIPRION 4400 platform which will double the performance of the current high-end PB200 VIPRION blades. We believe this new platform will be the highest performing ADC currently available. An eight-slot version of this platform is expected later in the year and will double the performance of the Senator Blade platform.","As we mentioned at the analyst and investor meeting in November, we will start to refresh all our 1U and 2U appliances this year leveraging the technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400.","With our virtual addition we now support Xen and Hyper-V hyper visors. All our software modules will be supported as virtual additions this year and we are continuing to develop new features for our centralized management system to better support application scalability and cloud environments and virtualize data centers.","Finally towards the end of the calendar year we expect to deliver significant new security capabilities with our Topaz project, including a network firewall, protocol protection and enhanced D-DOS and application security.","F5 solutions are being used more and more in data centers throughout the world as strategic control points to secure and optimize mission critical applications. With our expanding addressable market in areas like security and service providers, we intend to continue to aggressively invest in our sales resources, services business and our development facilities.","As far as the outlook is concerned Andy indicated that we expect to see continued sequential growth in the current quarter. As we mentioned at the start of the year, one of our important financial objectives is to deliver accelerating product revenue growth. Assuming no major change in the micro-economic environment, we expect to deliver product revenue growth acceleration in this coming quarter.","We also continue to target year-over-year total revenue growth of at least 20% in fiscal 2012. Our current tight line of business is very strong and with our technology leadership position we enjoy world class competitive win rates in all our major markets. As I mentioned earlier, we believe that TMOS V11 and new products like the VIPRION 2400 will continue to be a key goal driver throughout fiscal 2012.","The F5 team should be proud of the great start we\u2019ve made in fiscal 2012. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners and look forward to the continued support for the year.","So with that we\u2019ll now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions.) Our first question is from Paul Silverstein, Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse","Thanks. John and Andy can you talk about visibility and linearity in the quarter and how your visibility looks today compared to perhaps 90 days ago?","Andrew Reinland  ","Yeah. I think it\u2019s very comparable to 90 days ago. We usually talk about for the current quarter, you know, we get down to the deal level and we think we have good visibility on that. And then even six months or two quarters out we still think the visibility\u2019s pretty good. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed much.","John McAdams","And the seasonality was pretty normal for Q1 as well. There was nothing extraordinary there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tal Liana, Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open","Tal Liani - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good quarter. I want to ask about deferred revenues. Deferred revenues went up pretty nicely year-over-year and sequentially. Can you elaborate on what\u2019s behind it? Is it mainly service renewal timing? Is it seasonal or did you see also growth beyond seasonality? Thanks.","John McAdams","Yes the deferred revenue, the end of this quarter, the end of the calendar year so we do see a large bookings quarter every Q1 going back over time. But this was a very good quarter. No exceptional deals in there, just keep chasing every piece of renewal business down that there is.","John Eldridge ","Yeah and it is almost all maintenance contracts.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Kurtz, Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Allen Kurst \u2013 Sterne Agee","So as the 2400 gets more traction next couple of quarters here, how should we think about transaction size and gross margin profile and how that sort of impacts the rest of the product line?","John McAdams","We\u2019re not indicating that we expect to see a better gross margin profile. But we\u2019ll see. And the reason I say that is that obviously with the VIPRION 2400 there is much more opportunity to add software solutions. First of all BCMP, which is new which has got license associated with it, I mentioned in my introduction that we\u2019re seeing a strong interest in that. So by definition there we\u2019re going to see more software on the 2400 platform","And then the factor is performance functionality, which leads us to believe there will be more module attachments. Because that\u2019s what we started to see last quarter. But we\u2019re not giving any numbers out on that. We just think it\u2019s certainly going to be a good trend.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Ryan Hutchinson, Lazard. Your line is open.","Ryan Hutchinson - Lazard ","So I guess my question\u2019s on Telco. Clearly you indicated strength there. I know you touched on it, John, with respect to the demand there. But maybe if you could flush that out. And with respect to Version 11 is the new opportunity starting to hit stride there? You talked about it at the analyst day; you gave us some evidence of lab trials. I think what the investment community is really trying to get their arms around is with respect to that 20% growth target and how much of that is related to mobile being a piece of that.","And really your ability to physically sit behind Evolve Pack Core or the GSN etcetera over time and then evolve the business from where you are today to potentially where you\u2019re going. I think just any commentary across the board with respect to that strategy would be very helpful. I know it\u2019s been asked several times over the last several calls but never really answered in a definitive way and I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s key to people\u2019s understanding of why you guys grow in a lot of respects to what people believe is saturated market. Thank you.","John McAdams ","Yeah I think we\u2019ve always done that but maybe it\u2019s not been so clear. First of all as data increases within the service provider networks, pure data then obviously LTE will increase that dramatically and clearly more data\u2019s increasing it dramatically as well. As that increases our potential for optimization increases dramatically. So that is a core key driver for us.","And the other thing to think about our business is that, and I think we said this before as well, we don\u2019t tend to be looked upon as the plumbing that\u2019s put in as networks are being built. We do get involved in that architecture however as the data\u2019s increasing and the complexities increasing and there\u2019s more need to mass size that data, to monetize it, that\u2019s when our products really come into the ruin. And clearly VIPRION, the chassis has been very, very popular there.","And then the other area is within the service provider space and maybe Karl you can call on it, like firewall has been very strong as well.","Karl Triebes","Yeah I mean one of the big benefits of the VIPRION is we\u2019re able to consolidate a lot of features and functionality. And one of the things that we\u2019ve been asked by a lot of the surf providers to date is enhancing our firewall capabilities. And this includes having performance, having some very fundamental things like a better rule space language and management functionality behind that. And that\u2019s what we talked about at the analyst day. And that continues to progress.","There\u2019s a lot of other things too. You know the other piece is iRules and we get involved a lot with helping scale various parts of their infrastructure including things such as diameter or SIP or some of the other protocols that are running there. We also get called upon to do things like traffic steering. And traffic steering is based upon content and connections. And so VIPRION\u2019s really good at that and our infrastructure\u2019s very good at that. And with the performance, you know, it\u2019s just a natural thing to be placing behind either the PGW or the GGSN and their infrastructure.","Mark Anderson","You know we talked in November at the analyst meeting about the major use cases for Telco and these are just priorities for these guys. They\u2019re delaying spending on a lot of other places, obviously investing in LPE around the world. But these use cases are priorities because it\u2019s allowing a much more optimized use of their infrastructure to process the dramatic growth and data.","Operator","Thank you. Sanjiv Wadhwani from Stifel & Nicolaus, your line is open.","Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel & Nicolaus ","Just curious in talking about acceleration and product growth in Q2; are you seeing that specifically in your pipelines or is this sort of really the extension of the 2400 continuing to gain more and more traction?","John McAdams ","Well it\u2019s (inaudible) so we expect the 2400 to gain more and more attraction. We expect version 11 to gain more and more traction as we do with verticals like security solutions as well. But that is based upon a bigger pipeline. I mentioned our pipeline is very strong at the moment. I think we\u2019ve taken an appropriately cautious view of the cause rates and the fact of the pipeline, you know, given the potential risks in the economy. But the pipeline is extremely strong right now.","Operator","Thank you. Alex Henderson with Miller Tabak, your line is open.","Alex Henderson \u2013 Miller Tabak","I was hoping we could talk a little bit more about the security piece of your business. Obviously you\u2019ve been making a lot of investments there and doing a lot of work in that segment. It also seems quite clear that the technology is moving up the stack from the packet layer up into the application layer where your skill sets are uniquely qualified. Can you talk a little bit about the context around application management within the virtualization layer and how that impacts, how you set those up relative to those same parameters being utilized within the context of the security management process and if there\u2019s anyway to integrate across those two features.","Dan Matte  ","So a couple different angles to that. You know one is that you\u2019re absolutely right; the desire for security functionality is traveling up the stacks so people want more understanding of context. Not only who the user is, where they\u2019re coming from, which application they\u2019re accessing and what security policies are applicable for that particular application in that scenario.","I think we\u2019re pretty uniquely positioned to be able to deliver on that. One because the number of application level decisions per second to achieve that is very, very high and that plays right into our wheel house.","And then to follow on into the virtual conversation and portion of your question; as these applications begin to travel around within people\u2019s networks and data centers, it becomes important to have those policies follow them. And so what we\u2019re up to is absolutely having a way for our functionality to follow this application and be paired with them so that those policies do work out. And really in terms of what we\u2019re up to and sort of the permission that we have from our customers, they see that security portion of what we do is just a natural extension of our abilities and things that we offer them. So they\u2019re looking for us to provide those solutions.","So sort of beginning endings in terms of having stuff traveling around and being paired up on the virtual front. But you can expect to see much more from us in that area.","Operator","Thank you. Brent Bracelin, Pacific Crest, your line is open.","Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities","I wanted to actually ask a follow up around VIPRION sales tripled here year-over-year. I\u2019m trying to understand what\u2019s driving a mixed shift to chassis versus appliance. Are customers pulling you into new application environments that need a more faster, higher throughput and box? Is it just the 1u, 2u appliances are a bit stale and when that refresh happens you expect to see a more balanced view? Help us understand what\u2019s driving the VIPRION momentum and if there\u2019s a bigger trend going on that can explain why that business is tripling for you versus the traditional appliance business.","Karl Triebes","Part of it is the surf provider business obviously. As they\u2019re scaling their infrastructure that\u2019s putting increasing demand, as John mentioned in his script for the VIPRION placement. And if we penetrate more into those accounts we\u2019re also doing more advanced things in terms of how we may- doing- working with traffic, providing security features and functionality and other things. And so that just puts more demand on capacity.","And so I think part of it\u2019s that. I think parts are supports fro BC&P and some are other functionalities around IOPs because we\u2019re able to slice up their infrastructure and you know build a variety of different virtuals with big IP. And so that\u2019s attractive because you can reduce the numbers of clients you have to put around there.","And then also just to note, our revenue grew both for the 2400 and the 4400; it wasn\u2019t just one or the other. So that encompasses both when we talk about VIPRION. But really it\u2019s traffic. It\u2019s also security and other applications are getting attached and I think Telco probably.","John McAdams ","And also, not to miss that massive price performance increase. So you know the actual price performance is dramatic as to where the 2400 sale versus the existing range of products.","Operator","Bill Choi, Janney Montgomery Scott, your line is open.","Bill Choi - Janney Montgomery Scott","Continued growth in gross margins over the past several quarters, you know, fairly impressive particularly concerning the product revenue decline. I wonder if you could kind of rank order what\u2019s driving some of the gross margin expansion. You obviously have a virtual addition, which is going to be very high gross margins. You talk about higher attach rates with the module and form factor. I forget which quarter it was but somewhere in the past you guys talked about 30% attach rate. If you could update that and whatever else might be really moving this gross margin forward.","John McAdams ","You really answered the question there during the question in that software attach rate is significant. There\u2019s no question about it. And the fact that we\u2019ve got more pair within the hardware solutions to add more software. And you mentioned VCMP, which is obviously really taking up by the customers. And then the virtual edition as well when we talked about the growth, the year-over-year growth in that. So there\u2019s no question that there\u2019s been a makeshift in terms of software that helped our gross margin.","Operator","Troy Jensen, Piper Jaffray, your line is open.","Troy Jensen - Piper Jaffray","Congrats on the nice quarter gentlemen. Follow up on the 2400 here. So could you talk about- I guess I\u2019d be curious to know if lead time\u2019s extended throughout the quarter and if you\u2019re entering Q2 with more backlog for that product then maybe you thought?","And can you give a sense for how much of the sales of 2400 are into Telco versus the new products?","Karl Triebes","So to your question about lead times, I don\u2019t think our lead times for any of our platforms extended during the quarter at all. And I actually don\u2019t know the answer to the make up of the backlog but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything different than normal to highlight there.","John McAdams ","Yeah I think the 2400 is similar to the regular product line in terms of the ability to ship it. In terms of Telco versus enterprise, I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve got that data. Typically in the service provider space the 4400, the high one, has been more popular. But that\u2019s more- I mean I don\u2019t have the data behind that. So most of the 2400 is probably swaying towards security, swaying towards the enterprise at the moment. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ll maybe check for the next call.","Operator","Thank you.  Jeff Kvaal, Barclays Capital, your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal - Barclays Capital ","I was wondering if we could delve into visibility into a couple of the areas that we have all had some concern about given the headline. How comfortable are you feeling with your visibility and pipeline in Europe? It sounds like Telco you feel fine. But then again also in federal. Thank you.","John McAdams   ","The visibility generally we feel good about. And if you look at the sheer volume and we look at the fact of the pipeline and we look at the close rates that we are applying to that, you know that feels good to us and we don\u2019t see any red flag there at all.","Federal of course the visibility there is not so good. But hoping it gets better as we go through the year but we did see delays in projects that we\u2019ve already won, we know we\u2019re going to get the business but the actual purchase order didn\u2019t come out and federal was a little bit disappointing on that basis.","So I think it\u2019s too early to say the visibility in federal has jumped up completely but you know I would say the decline is it was only 4% of our business and I\u2019m not quite sure where the bail went on the federal vertical but that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.","The rest of the business we feel good. As Andy said, we always feel pretty good about our visibility on a quarterly basis with our fact of pipeline and our assumptions there and the forecasting mechanism that we\u2019ve got with the sales force. We feel reasonable about our six-month profile in terms of the way the business is shaping up. And then it gets more cloudy as you go beyond the six months.","In other words there\u2019s no major change really in the visibility.","Operator","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, your line is open.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","If you think about the year in total, what do you think would be the biggest contributor in terms of dollar value that gets you to 30% growth this year? Is it Telco, Security and then virtualization in that order? Or is it more confidence from coming from a big upgrade from your existing core customers?","John McAdams  ","You got me smiling again. So we basically have a goal of at least 20% growth for this fiscal year. I do believe actually that version 11, the core version 11 that we\u2019ve done with the feature sets that we\u2019ve got there, the trends in service provider in terms of the data, the acceptance that we\u2019re now seeing our customers in terms of being a security player, I really think they\u2019re going to play out this year. And they certainly played out in the quarter.","So I think as we look back I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to see. You\u2019re going to see strong 2400 with no real competition against it. I think that towards the end of the year as we refresh the low end we should see some opportunity there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Simon Leopold, Morgan Keegan, your line is open.","Simon Leopold - Morgan Keegan","I wanted to maybe follow on in terms of your growth outlook. Let\u2019s go with the 20% or greater assumption. How much of that do you see driven by the market adjacencies? Particularly you\u2019ve talked quite a bit about security, a little bit less about things like when optimization. But I\u2019m trying to get my hands around how big those are in your assumptions as contributors to this growth rate.","John McAdams    ","I mean we don\u2019t typically break out, for example, what we\u2019ve done within the security space in the quarter. We did say that the application firewall revenues were the best ever. And we did say that we saw some good sequential growth in our access technology like APM and Edge Gateway, and they are significant. I mean they are non-trivial in terms of growth and as a percentage of the revenue that we do. But then you get into the subject of variant security. For we may be putting in a large 2400 installation to do as an application firewall that\u2019s also doing one optimization and then also is doing application optimization. And that gets quite subjective in doing that. So that\u2019s why we tend not to get specific numbers. But the ASN with security only type solutions, the access, you know, they\u2019re very important.","Operator","The next question will be from Brian Modoff, Deutsche Bank, your line is open.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Okay John so let\u2019s try that a different way. Let\u2019s look at security side and the ASM module, what do you think your attach rate is with your installed base? And what do you think it can be over time in terms of the adoption? What feedback have you gotten from your client base with regard to your proposal on the application layer?","John McAdams  ","I mean you know Brian you know we don\u2019t give out the attach rates specifics of our modules. But to give you an idea, if you look at the larger account base that we\u2019ve got and you look at the geographies, ASM has been very, very strong in Europe, it\u2019s becoming stronger and stronger in North America. The sales force and the AFC are becoming much more security savvy. You may have seen we hired a new person in the team, Manuel Rivelo, and that\u2019s his goal is to push that security throughout the sales force and optimize the solutions. It\u2019s pretty critical. But we don\u2019t give the actual attach rate.","Andrew Reinland ","But for certain priority for spending is going to security for a lot of these enterprise customers. And I think now more than ever our competitiveness in these different businesses has never been stronger. So feature parody or superiority is pretty clear across the board for us.","John McAdams ","And just in closing, an obvious statement on security is that security is really becoming right to the forefront of our customers. So we\u2019re really at the right time here in terms of the application solution that we have.","Manuel Rivelo","I\u2019ll just add something to that John. This is Manny. What we\u2019re seeing from the customer base across the board and we\u2019ve seen a lot of examples of it this week just with the service attack and some of the breaches that have happened for the major corporations, application vulnerability is at an all time high. And all of our customers are seeing that. So the ASM module has become front and center for all of them. It\u2019s industry-leading performance, capability, and as a result of that we\u2019re seeing a lot of traction. It\u2019s relatively new in the market in the sense that application firewalls are not well understood so there\u2019s a market awareness also that\u2019s occurring. But we\u2019re seeing that at all major, major accounting we expect to have future success there.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Prianka Chopra with Bush Securities. Your line is open.","Prianka Chopra - Bush Securities ","I wanted to ask you just quickly back to Telco. It was down sequentially and I just want to get a sense of what you saw the carriers doing or major service providers doing in the quarter.","And when you talk about pipeline, John, being strong, does that mean that Telco is sort of rebounding in the upcoming quarter?","John McAdams  ","I\u2019m not going to be specific to that. Let me just do the pipeline. Telco is very important to our pipeline, there\u2019s no doubt about that. And we do see some really large projects out there. But by nature given that they\u2019re large projects you can see some lumpiness. But the pipeline as we look forward in the service pipeline we feel very good about it. We think we\u2019re definitely making progress in terms of identifying the solutions that we really bring to the market that are very, very core to the business of Telco\u2019s. So that\u2019s really important.","Andrew Reinland ","And Roe we\u2019ve talked in the past about for our business in particular the five that Q4 usually in the Telco space is seasonally down. So if you look at the last two Q1s for us, it was 21% and 21%. So actually the sequential down is in line with our expectations but a better quarter then we historically seen Q4.","John Eldridge ","Thank you very much. We look forward to seeing all of you at some point out on the road in the next quarter or two. And we appreciate you joining us for today\u2019s call.","Operator","Thank you.

Thank you for joining us today. I'll talk briefly to our business drivers before handing over to Frank to review the quarter's results in detail.","With 30% software revenue growth in the quarter, we're delivering strong results from the resource shifts we've made in the last 18 months. Customers are leveraging our multi-cloud deployment model and consuming our flagship software and offerings, both on-prem and in the public cloud. Increasingly, they are consuming for new vehicles, including subscriptions and enterprise license agreements.","Security services, including Advanced WAF and bot mitigation are leading the vast majority of our customer conversations and public cloud continues to be our strongest software growth area. I will speak to our software growth drivers in more detail later in my remarks.","Systems revenues declined in line with the market, down 5% in the quarter. As expected, with customers adopting a cloud-first mentality, hardware investment and use cases are being carefully evaluated, and we are seeing some elongations of deal timing as a result.","That said, we continue to see systems growth opportunities in certain segments of the market such as high-performance security use case and in emerging markets. Our Services business delivered 4% growth in the quarter and continues to produce robust gross margins while maintaining world-class customer satisfaction scores.","Our services capabilities continue to differentiate F5 as customers' application environment has become increasingly sophisticated and they recognize the need for reliable and responsive support from their most critical solution providers. We are achieving consistently strong 90%-plus attach rates.","In fact the attach rate for the Americas increased 300 basis points in the quarter. As we discussed at our Analyst and Investor Day in March 2018, over time, we do expect our services growth rates to slow as we transition to a higher percentage of subscription and other service offerings.","In summary, we're very pleased with the progress we are seeing in our software transition. Progress that will be augmented as we begin to see contribution from our recently launched as-a-service platform, F5 Cloud Services, and as we complete the acquisition of NGINX. I'll speak to both topics in greater detail after Frank reviews our Q2 results and our outlook for the third quarter. Frank?","Frank Pelzer","Thank you, Francois and good afternoon, everyone. As Francois noted, we delivered solid revenue and strong EPS growth in the quarter. Second quarter revenue of $545 million was up approximately 2% year-over-year and within our guided range of $543 million to $553 million. GAAP EPS was $1.93 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.57 per share was above our guidance of $2.53 to $2.56 per share.","Q2 product revenue of $238 million was flat year-over-year and accounted for approximately 44% of total revenue. As Fran\u00e7ois mentioned, software grew 30% year-over-year and represented approximately 19% of product revenue, up 80 basis points from Q1 as a percent of product revenue.","Systems revenue of $192 million made up approximately 81% of product revenue and was down 5% year-over-year and roughly flat sequentially. Services revenue of $307 million grew 4% year-over-year and represented approximately 56% of total revenue.","On a regional basis, in Q2, America's revenue grew 4% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA was flat year-over-year and accounted for 25% of overall revenue. APAC revenue grew 1% year-over-year and accounted for 19% of total revenue.","Looking at our bookings by vertical. Enterprise customers represented 65% of product bookings. Service providers accounted for 20%. Our government business in the quarter reflected some modest impact from the government shutdown representing 16% of product bookings, including 6% from U.S. Federal.","In Q2, we had three greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 20% of total revenue, and Arrow and Tech Data, each of which accounted for 10%.","Let's now turn to operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85%, in line with our expectations. GAAP operating expenses were $314 million.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $273 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 26.2%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 34.9% in line with our expectations. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.8%.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q2, we generated $194 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling over $1.6 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 53 days.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $29 million, up sequentially as we continue to build out our new facility in Downtown Seattle. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $33.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $1.16 billion.","Approximately half of the increase over the prior year quarter relates to the adoption of 606. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,795 employees, up 215 people from Q1 as we continue to hire aggressively as planned in our growth areas, including sales and research & development. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 617,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $162.06 per share for a total of $100 million.","Now let me share our guidance for fiscal Q3 of '19. Unless otherwise stated, please note that all of my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. Also, with NGINX not closed, our guidance today excludes any impact to revenue or cost from the transaction.","Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making with our software transition and remain confident in our position in the market and in the growth opportunities for the business. We also believe we are well aligned with the long-term trend towards multi-cloud environments and increasing demand for application security.","In addition, we are seeing increasing traction with subscription and ELA offerings as they provide customers consumption flexibility and better agility for their ever-evolving software architectures. With this in mind, we are targeting Q3 of '19 revenue in the range of $550 million to $560 million. We expect gross margins of approximately 85% to 85.5%.","We estimate operating expenses of $275 million to $287 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year will remain in the 21% to 22% range we previously provided for the full fiscal year with some fluctuation quarter-to-quarter. Our Q3 earnings target is $2.54 to $2.57 per share. In the quarter, we expect share-based compensation expense of approximately $40 million and $1.7 million in amortization of purchase tangible assets.","Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $110 million to $130 million for the year. This range includes approximately $70 million of cost related to our previously announced corporate headquarter move to F5 Tower in Downtown Seattle. The initial phase of the move occurred over the last several weeks and we expect to complete the move this summer.","I'll reiterate that we continue to expect NGINX transaction to close in the second calendar quarter, but we have not included any revenue or cost impact from the deal in our guidance. We expect any revenue impact in the quarter will be immaterial and expect to provide contribution details when we report our Q3 quarter results.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Frank. I'll spend just a few minutes on the trends we're seeing in the business and highlighting some customer wins from the quarter before we move to Q&A. Focusing first on our 30% software growth. We are accelerating software growth across three vectors.","First, we are capitalizing on significant customer demand for security capabilities packaged as software. This is particularly true as customers deploy multi-cloud applications, including applications in the public cloud where the demand for security is even more critical.","As a result, security use cases continue to drive our software growth rate and account for a higher share of our overall product business. In particular, our anti-bot and machine-generated traffic monitoring and blocking capabilities is appealing to customers who continue to face an increasing array of threats.","We are also seeing new security use cases emerge, including privileged user access, credential stuffing and zero trust. As an example, during the quarter, we deployed a combination of access policy manager and our Advanced WAF at an International energy company. They selected F5 to secure their application access. In other words, applications on their network are secured with an F5 application security policy.","For example, F5 provides highly secure access to systems on their oil rigs and oil plants for third parties doing systems maintenance. The second vector accelerating software growth comes from our subscription and ELA consumption models, which were introduced last year and provide customers flexibility as they manage the transition to multi-cloud environments.","Increasingly, customers are using ELAs to leverage our technology in public clouds. During the quarter, we closed three times the number of opportunities and near that in value compared to the first quarter. While the overall dollars are still relatively small, ELAs are an important tool for our sales force and we have a robust third quarter ELA pipeline.","As an example, during Q2, we closed an ELA with an online gaming company. The customer needed the flexibility to deploy Advanced WAF and API capabilities to protect the games' layer 7 DDoS, bots and bad actors. Using an ELA consumption model, we replaced other security vendors and gave the customer the flexibility to deploy the needed multi-cloud security application services when and where they want.","The second ELA example came from an airline undergoing digital transformation and pivoting to a multi-cloud approach. This customer preferred an ELA to ensure flexibility as their needs scale. They selected our high-performance BIG-IP Virtual Edition as well as BIG-IQ.","The same customer also upgraded from the public cloud native Web Application Firewall to F5's Advanced Web Application Firewall. They are using F5 to secure their consumer loyalty application with both bot mitigation and credential stuffing protection.","This deployment offers an interesting example of how F5 can work across often siloed teams within an organization as we work successfully with both the network and the security teams.","The third vector for accelerating software growth is our advanced capabilities in automation, orchestration and central management, which resonate with customers facing an increasingly complex combination of environments and sprawling deployments. In fact, our ability to unify and simplify deployments is unlocking new spend.","For instance, during the quarter, we had a large U.S. payment processor purchase BIG-IQ to manage their global infrastructure deployment of BIG-IP. The customer had come to F5 last year looking for a solution to help them automate their infrastructure and operate at the speed of business. They are now deploying BIG-IQ to manage their global estate of hundreds of BIG-IP instances.","As we look toward the back half of 2019, we believe we will continue to drive software growth with a number of catalysts. First, in Q2, we launched our F5-as-a-Service platform and the first SaaS offering running on top of it. F5 Cloud Services is designed to support modern deployment scenarios.","These include cloud native applications in container-based environments with high availability, strong service, enterprise-grade SaaS solutions that are easily provisioned and configured within minutes. Launched with a basic DNS service set, we have a number of customer already in free 60-day trials. Later this year, we'll deliver even more F5 enterprise-grade SaaS abilities, including security services designed to protect applications from existing and emerging threats.","Another catalyst for continued software growth is a new high-grade ELA consumption model we're launching in response to additional use cases. Customers have asked for an ELA that protects their entitlement when they are migrating from hardware to a software and cloud environment.","With this new high-grade ELA, we are providing customers even more flexibility and license portability as they contemplate digital transformation and what it means for their businesses. We have already developed pipeline and we are excited about what this new model means for future multi-cloud application services.","Finally, we are increasingly confident in the opportunities enabled by our acquisition of NGINX. We continue to expect the acquisition to close in the second calendar quarter. In the weeks since our initial announcements, internal reaction from both F5 and NGINX has been very positive and initial integration planning is going well.","Customers across all theaters are very excited about what they see as the strong potential of the combination and the ability to bridge the divide between NetOps and dev ops. Together, F5 and NGINX will be able to offer solutions that provide the requisite control to satisfy the CIO while giving application developers the freedom to innovate.","We are excited by the complementarity between F5's cloud native app services platform and NGINX' controller. As a result, post-close we expect to converge both under one product family using the NGINX brand and maintaining the momentum in NGINX' current offering.","This converged offering will address a larger total addressable market and will span a broader set of used cases across dev ops and Super-NetOps customer personas. When closed, we expect our F5 cloud native team to move under NGINX CEO, Gus Robertson, providing a significant increase to the NGINX engineering team and additional resources to accelerate new product capabilities and use cases.","The traction we're getting with our software solution is perhaps the most demonstrable evidence that F5 is on a path to become the leader in multi-cloud application services. I mentioned in my opening remarks that customers are increasingly taking a cloud-first approach. We are as well.","As our customers contemplate and begin to work across multiple environments, F5's value proposition actually increases. Organizations of all sizes are quickly learning that operating in multiple environments make things more complicated and F5's solution simplify that complexity with consistent, environment-agnostic policies, automation, orchestration and central management.","I'll speak briefly to our service provider business before we go to Q&A. We continue to drive our network function virtualization, or NFV, solutions in new areas of service providers' business. We are securing DNS and CGNAT wins in growth portions of providers' networks, and we see wirelined and MSO deals ramping.","Recent wins with wireline carriers include DDoS, DNS and firewall services. In addition, we are also seeing opportunities emerge from managed web application firewalls. We continue to have conversations with mobile operators about 5G and while we continue to see the majority of near-term 5G spend focused on the spectrum and radio portions of the network, we are confident that our spending moves towards the core there will be increased opportunities for F5.","During Q2, we successfully expanded our use case with a North American communications provider to include security. We are now providing WAF to front-end all of their consumer-facing websites. The same communications provider was also experiencing numerous outages and network challenges in its field technicians network, which was leading to unsatisfactory customer experiences. F5 proposed an access policy manager solution with manageability through BIG-IQ.","This allowed the provider to achieve greater scale and reliability while supporting dual stack connection, allowing for better access and stability for internal users and delivering greater efficiency for remote field technicians. We're also having discussions with this customer as they contemplate the move from 4G to 5G and expect that as they transition, our sales motion with them will become more software focused.","This is true with another service provider customer as well, where during the quarter we secured a large systems win to help them handle increased traffic and deployed NFV functionality with BIG-IP Virtual Editions.","In closing, my thanks to the entire F5 team, our partners, our customers and our shareholders. We are on this journey together. Our customers' digital transformation requires a continuous transformation of our business and we are embracing that challenge. With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks. I appreciate it. First one, Frank, first from a regional perspective, was there anything unique in the quarter in the EMEA region, you have been posting strong growth over the better part of the past six quarters. And there was a significant downtick from your previous growth rate in the quarter, similarly there was an uptick in the Americas. Can you discuss what's going on regionally? And then I've got a follow-up.","Frank Pelzer","Yes. I think - North America I think we had a solid quarter, specifically internationally, and I'll go to Europe where for the last three quarters we've got growth - we've got year-on-year growth rate now in the 7% to 8% range. And this quarter, Europe was flat year-on-year. That was concentrated specifically in the U.K. where I think we saw this uncertainty around Brexit push up some deals.","And I think we also had some softness in Germany, specifically sort of Germany, Austria region. And so as a result, we had less than perhaps we would've hoped in Europe. Overall, if you recall, Paul, about 18 months ago, we felt we were having some execution challenges in Europe.","We made a lot of progress on those - we made some changes both in leadership and in the way that we have put our formation in Europe. We feel we've made a lot of progress there with these challenges, but these progress are still in the - with a backdrop of continued macro uncertainty in Europe.","And so I think that's what we're dealing with. But generally, we're happy with the way we're - our team is organized and performing over there. I think this quarter was specific to the U.K. and a little bit in Germany.","And then in Asia-Pacific, we also had less cost than we've had in the last couple of quarters, but we think that's a little bit of lumpiness there. Generally, the trajectory for our business in Asia-Pacific is north, and we continue to expect good growth in that region. There isn't anything macro that we worry about there at the moment.","Paul Silverstein","Hey, Francois, on the Brexit comment, just playing devil's advocate, why now? Brexit has been hanging out there for a while, one would think that last quarter, the quarter before, no different than this quarter that, that would have presented a challenge to you and other suppliers, i.e. the uncertainty.","And then I also want to ask you, last quarter you made a comment about lack of manpower in the federal government to actually process the paperwork, which was adversely impacting you from a rev rec standpoint. But there wasn't otherwise an issue related to federal government weakness. And I'm wondering if there's been any change with respect to that?","Francois Locoh-Donou","On Brexit, Paul, you're right. But the - I guess there has been some uncertainty around it. But folks have known that the outcome would be - that the U.K. would exit the European Union. In the last few months, the uncertainty around how that would happen and when, you probably followed all the episodes of this, has increased. And a number of companies have been trying to make contingency plans for what will happen in the very short term.","So in the last month of the quarter, in the U.K. in particular, we saw folks push out decisions because they wanted to wait until they had clarity on what the real outcome would be. Specifically on the Fed, we did - we had a reasonable quarter in the Fed.","We - it could have been better if the government shutdown had not taken place. The impact for us is we didn't lose any business but there was some business that wasn't processed in the quarter.","Even though the shutdown ended I think early February, there was some business that we had won that wasn't really processed in the quarter. So there is a few deals that could have come in the quarter that did not come. But overall, we thought we had a reasonable quarter in the Fed.","Paul Silverstein","All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Alex Kurtz","Thanks. Thanks for taking the question. Francois, just on your commentary around the service providers, it sounded like you're becoming more constructive about the opportunity. I know it's been a challenging vertical over last couple of years. Is something changing there from a demand perspective? Should we start thinking about these group of customers maybe growing faster than the overall business for a period of time?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Alex, I would not conclude that for now. I think we're still cautious about the near-term opportunity with service providers. We felt better about a couple of the North America service providers this quarter than we were in Q1. But overall, if I look at the - our use cases and spend globally with service providers, I still think we are in the middle of this 4G to 5G transition. And that there are good opportunities ahead of us sort of several quarters out, once we see the rollout to 5G radios and the capacity upgrades that will happen for us.","In the meantime, though, we are getting a lot of traction with service providers in two areas specifically. NSD, where we're seeing them use more and more our virtual solutions. So they did contribute to our growth in software as well and also in security, on a number of use cases, including firewalls but also things like CGNAT and other use cases. So these two areas in service providers are doing well. And hopefully the 5G will come, but as we said that's a few quarters out.","Alex Kurtz","And just clarify do you think 5G could be a better dollar opportunity for F5 and 4G wasn't? I know you weren't here for that. But just talking to the team that works those accounts. Is there a sense of just could it be at a better dollar opportunity?","Francois Locoh-Donou","We think so because of the sort of size and scale of these deployments. The fact that we're very well positioned to help teams like network slicing that are critical in 5G and then the way they'll have to handle the traffic, what's going to happen at the edge, around processing more and more traffic and applications at the edge. There are a lot of catalyst that give us a belief that this could be a meaningful, and perhaps more meaningful than 4G, impact on F5.","Alex Kurtz","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Thank you. Francois, I just wanted to clarify, I think, in your comments about the system revenue being down 5%, you mentioned you are seeing some elongation of deal timing. Is it primarily, you're seeing kind of them evaluating other solutions? Or potentially evaluating kind of a move to the cloud? Or is it more just kind of pause in spending that you're seeing? If you could just clarify what you're seeing there?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Samik. It's not a - I wouldn't characterize it as a pause in spending. The phenomenon there is as customers adopt the stance that is more software first or cloud first, they do scrutinize their spend on hardware more. And as a result, the approval cycles for hardware are getting elongated. And I think that's what we're seeing really as the dynamics in large enterprise organizations.","But those that have made a decision to go software first or to go cloud first, from the time we have a project that a team has approved and want to go forward to the time that, that transaction can be processed, there is lot more scrutiny on it. That's what I was referring to.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay. Got it. And just a quick second one. You've referred to the launch of the cloud native product as well as a service offering in the quarter. When you're going and kind of looking at these - kind of asking your customers that look at these products, are they kind of opting to wait for the NGINX controller to be available that you mentioned you kind of put them together and have a converged offering?","Or - I mean, what are you seeing in terms costumer behavior and as the NGINX controller being kind of a deciding factor and you would rather wait for it or kind of close the deals even before it?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Yes, so Samik, I think your - so there was an announcement in the quarter about F5 Cloud Services, which is, I think, a pretty important milestone because it's the first Software-as-a-Service offering of F5 and talking later about what I see as catalyst for F5 Cloud Services.","But I think your question is specifically between NGINX and cloud native application services platform that F5 has been developing. So on that, it's actually fairly straightforward. The NGINX brings to the table element of the portfolio that are not in the virtual ADC space.","So they are completely complementary to what we have been doing. And it's really their API Gateway technology, what they've been doing in web server and app server space and those are completely new, adjacent TAMs for F5. In the virtual ADC space specifically, NGINX has a controller that is in the market and our cloud native app services platform was really based on a controller that we have built organically, but hadn't been launched in the market yet.","And so we've been in the initial stages of integration planning and where we're headed with that is there is significant complementarity between the two in the sense that the NGINX controller appeals to a - I would say, a fairly sophisticated dev ops audience whereas our controller was more targeted, it was a mainstream enterprise buyer that really wanted an easy way to control their data plans.","And so what we're doing is we're going to start with the NGINX controller because it is in the market, it is in use with customers, and we of course want to maintain and accelerate that momentum. But we are going to rapidly port the capabilities of our controller to the NGINX controller, so that the combined offering can target a larger addressable market from the very sophisticated dev ops users all the way to the less sophisticated that want an easy capability with all the analytics that come with it. So we're pretty excited about that potential acceleration of the combined offering.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay. That is very clear. Thanks, Francois. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sami Badri","Great. Thank you. So the software revenue and then the watermarks that you're starting to reach every single quarter is very commendable, but I think the one thing I just want to try to understand is on margins. It looks like, on a sequential basis, there is a little bit of a pressure now. The operating margin that you had this quarter makes sense given your aggressive hirings you commented on.","But on specifically non-GAAP gross margins, can you just walk us through what exactly is happening on the cost side, just because you think that a software ramps up dramatically more, you see some margin expansion and we just want to get a better idea on what exactly is going on.","Frank Pelzer","Hi Sami. It's Frank. Let me start with that one. It's actually right in line with our expectations, what we said was sort of 85% to 85.5%. So we were at the lower end of that range. But it was exactly as we expected to come on board. Over a long period of time, as we scaled the software business the actual inherent margin in there in the growth side is higher than the hardware business.","And so as we talked about at AIM in 2018, as we get even further into closer to Horizon 2, you should see some of the impacts of that investment start to make its way as additional component of our product revenue comes from software and is a better driver for an expansion in that gross margin side. But I'd just go back to say but this is exactly what we expected it and how we talked about it in guidance last quarter.","Sami Badri","Got it. And then the - I think one thing on NGINX, there is lot of commentary on bringing in NGINX and integrating it and going to market more under the NGINX umbrella and unifying the offerings. So one other kind of follow-up question to all of this narrative, is there - will there be any type of cannibalistic dynamics by doing this with the existing F5 business?","And just to kind of use a historical or illustrative example is, if everybody was moving from physical ADC to virtual ADC, there could be an element of cannibalism right to the revenue streams? Is there anything like that, that could potentially emerge by integrating NGINX and going to market with that brand and integrating all F5 services and NGINX together? Could there be potentially any type of cannibalistic dynamics to your revenue stream by doing that?","Francois Locoh-Donou","I think the short answer to that, Sami, is we don't think so. So just to be clear, NGINX does not a direct - so if one wants to go from their current mode of deployment, of using ADC as part of their infrastructure to support multiple applications, but they want to go from a hardware ADC to a virtual ADC, we already cover that today with our Virtual Editions.","And we do that very well which is why, in part, our software has been growing at the rate it has, it's because of what we're doing on Virtual Editions, the introduction of our Cloud Edition and the IQ platform that provides better centralized management and automation and orchestration, and the flexible consumption that we give people around our enterprise license agreement that allow them to have license portability.","All of these things address the use case of how do you go to virtualized ADC deployment and we're doing very well there. The NGINX capability is really more of an augmentation of that than a cannibalization of that, and if you look at the use case of their addressing it's really dev ops folks who want to build their load balancing or ADC capabilities much closer to the application logic as part of new dev ops environment.","And that isn't a cannibalization of the things we do today, it's rather a new growth area for new applications that are being built and deployed either on-prem or in public cloud.","Sami Badri","Got it. Got it. Thank you very much for those answers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. I have two. One is pretty simple, in the quarter you did $100 million share repurchase, but you do have this acquisition. Just want to get a revisit of your plans in terms of share buybacks, given the long-standing pattern had been around $150 million a quarter, now we see a couple of quarters at $100 million. Want to get a better understanding of how to think about it going forward? And then I have a follow up on the verticals.","Frank Pelzer","Sure, Simon. So as we discussed on March 11 when we talked about the canceling of our automatic share repurchase program, our view point really hasn't changed and so we do view our cash balance as a very strategic asset for us, and we're going to use that opportunistically.","It may be for additional share repurchases we're not just going to automatically do, but be opportunistic about. It may be for additional acquisitions or it may be for other activities. So for the time, we have talked about we're suspending the automatic share repurchase but we're going to be opportunistic with additional share repurchases in the future.","Simon Leopold","Thanks. And Francois, in your prepared remarks, I had the impression that you were pleasantly surprised about the telco results this quarter kind of getting back to a trend we had observed during much of fiscal '18, just over $100 million versus $76-ish million in the prior quarter.","And so I understand what you said about the outlook, but if we look at the March quarter, if you were pleasantly surprised by the telco improvement, was there an unpleasant surprise offsetting it? What was weaker than you expected in the quarter? And maybe elaborate on what trends would be in that aspect of the business mix?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Hey, Simon. So I'll start with the last part of your question. What was weaker than I expected in the quarter was Europe. I thought we could have done better and I think as I said the dynamic in the last month of the quarter was weaker than we would've thought. And there was a little bit we could've done more in the Fed. But again, I think we had kind of anticipated that because of the shutdown.","As it relates to service providers, I wasn't necessarily pleasantly surprised. I think what we were trying to point to is, in our first quarter, service providers were particularly weak. And I felt the interpretation of that was perhaps too strong because the service provider segment is naturally lumpy.","And so I think we wanted to point out that we came back to numbers in the service provider space that are more in line with historical mix for F5. But that being said, I am still cautious about the service provider segment for the next few quarters because of the transition dynamics we've talked to.","Simon Leopold","And what's your expectation for the behavior from Europe over the next few quarters?","Francois Locoh-Donou","My expectation is, I think we continue to make very good progress on our own internal execution with the changes we've made. So we've have grown very confident and Chad Whalen, our Global Head of Sales, has been very confident about the leadership team and the formation of the resources that we have in place there.","I have a little bit of cautions specifically around U.K. and Germany, based upon what we've seen. But overall, I think with the changes we've made and the hiring we've had in Europe, our expectation would be that we continue to grow in Europe.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thank you for taking the questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Michael Genovese from MKM Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Genovese","Thanks very much. Francois, hi, I wanted to check in and go back to the presentation when you acquired NGINX and gave the post-NGINX Horizon 1 guidance. And just checking and see if those guideposts are still going to be applicable after today.","Francois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Mike. Yes, they are.","Michael Genovese","So generally speaking, post-acquisition we should model and for this year, next year a little bit faster revenue growth, but a little bit of dilution in the EPS. I just want to make sure that we're factoring in the acquisition correctly.","Francois Locoh-Donou","That's correct.","Michael Genovese","Okay. That's all for me. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rod Hall","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I had two. I wanted to start off with the OpEx line, particularly R&D. We continue to see R&D creeping up a little bit, especially if we look over a multiyear period, and we've just bought NGINX. So I'm just wondering how much more R&D do you think you need to spend to integrate that, and to continue to push products forward.","Should we anticipate that the R&D line continues to grow as a percentage of sales for a while or does that stabilize in a few quarters? And then I have a follow-up to that.","Frank Pelzer","Hi, Rod. I think you'll see the R&D line pick up a little more over the next few quarters both because of the NGINX acquisition and additional investment that we want to make to catalyze or capitalize on the opportunities in front of us, specifically in the case of NGINX, beyond the organic investment there.","We want to port security capabilities into the NGINX platform fairly quickly. We want to accelerate what they've been doing in the API management space. It's a big market. There is a big opportunity there. They didn't have the resources to fully capitalize on the opportunity for us. We're going to accelerate that. Same on the application server space. So all of these things should pick up.","And then in security, we also are going to continue to make more investments. We've had very strong traction in security in the first half of 2019, both for our own on-prem offerings and increasingly our managed services security offerings in civil line and our cloud services in security and software services.","And as you know, the market and security is, of course, moving more to software-managed services and cloud. And so we've got some exciting offerings and we're going to press ahead with those opportunities. That being said, all of that - all of those investments have just gone through.","They were considered when we gave a revised Horizon 1 guidance of operating profit between 33% and 35% for Horizon 1. So all of that's accounted into what we should expect.","Rod Hall","So are you - just to clarify that, Fran\u00e7ois, you're saying that it creeps up in the next couple of quarters, then it stabilizes? Or does it creep up peak and come back off? Just can you give us some idea on trajectory, what we ought to be thinking?","Francois Locoh-Donou","I think it stabilizes. We're not giving specific guidance for next year, but essentially I think it stabilizes to get into that 33%, 35% range for Horizon 1.","Rod Hall","Okay. And then my follow-up was with regards to service providers, the telco revenue, I mean if our calculations are right, I guess they are, I mean you are right back to the revenue - absolute revenue level you were at two quarters ago. When you guys had said last quarter after the big deterioration in that revenue line, you thought it'd take a couple of quarters to get back.","And we kind of had the impression from you that, that was pretty concentrated, the deterioration of that revenue. So I just wonder, any color you could give on what happened there? Was there a project that you thought would be delayed longer that came back or did - that one or two carriers that deteriorated in revenue terms add new projects? Just give us any color on why that snapped back so much more quickly than you thought it would?","Frank Pelzer","Well, it was, Rod. It was pretty concentrated and we've had good projects this quarter around a couple of carriers where we have the specific softness. My comments overall are related to the opportunity that we see in service provider. And I think the levels where we're at today are not the levels where we would like to be 18 months down the road when we - the 5G opportunity is truly - would truly mainstream.","Rod Hall","Okay. Thanks, Francois.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Catharine Trebnick from Dougherty. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Catharine Trebnick","Oh, thanks for taking my question. Back to the service provider. Any - are - which regions do you think are tracking faster as far as getting ready to implement 5G? And then where do you think your best position, North America? Because you have such good relationships with top tier carriers, one? And how are you doing in Asia PAC versus EMEA? Thank you.","Chad Whalen","Hi Catherine, this is Chad Whalen.","Catharine Trebnick","Hi.","Chad Whalen","I think - how are you?","Catharine Trebnick","Good.","Chad Whalen","From a service-provider perspective, I think that we've - across the different theaters, we're seeing motions kind of isolated certain countries outside of North America. And I would say that there is been a stronger movement in some of the APAC region as opposed to maybe throughout Europe.","And here in North America, there is deep interest in what's going on with 5G planning both in terms of core capacity for enhanced mobile broadband, which is kind of the first service that they are launching. But more importantly for us, is the new architectures they include mac at the edge.","And we're spending a lot of time and that's a forcing function for what we're doing around our virtual software offerings. So we're seeing it kind of broad based, but I would say from a concentration perspective, North America and Asia Pac are probably furthest along.","Catharine Trebnick","And are you seeing any different competitors spring up in this area, especially when it comes to the NFV piece of it, combining GNAT (sic) [CGNAT] and - with DDoS and DPI? Are you seeing any other - I mean who do you typically see when you're competing at that level? Thanks.","Chad Whalen","Well, from a - in many parts of the globe, the network equipment providers are kind of the key access into the carriers. And so Nokia, Ericsson, Samsung is new and has made a pretty marketable impression in a APCJ and we're expecting that to continue in EMEA. In terms of new entrants on the software side, Affirmed Networks has been around for some time, we see them some more. But it's typically the same players that we're seeing and have seen in the 4G space that are transitioning in the 5G.","Catharine Trebnick","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Vinod on for Ittai. Thanks for taking the question. I have another NGINX question. You know, I know it's early in the planning and integration projects, but now that you're converging NGINX with cloud native, how does your go-to-market approach change? Are you going to be adopting their approach?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Vinod. So the approach that we have around the NGINX opportunities, we are going to integrate their sales force, which has been, I would say, for the most part, an inside sales motion. We're going to integrate that organization into Chad Whalen's global sales organization. And we're going to complement that inside sales motion with the enterprise high-touch sales motion that F5 has had in place and excels at.","And I think with the combination of these two capabilities, we're going to be able to touch both the low-end deals as well as more and more the high-end, high-touch deals, because one of the things that we think is going to accelerate as we monetize NGINX at scale is that with the acceleration of their controller capabilities with the new resources that we are putting in, NGINX is going to have access to deals of, I think, increasing size as well as larger deals in the enterprise space.","And so we really think we're going to need both motions. Both motions are going to under a single organizational umbrella under Chad Whalen and we've already started to think about the governance and collaboration between these organizations to make that very smooth.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","And that's all the questions we have time for today. Thank you for joining. This concludes today's conference call.

If you plan to attend the meeting, you can register online from the link on our IR Events Calendar entry for November 13.","Now I will turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. In my prepared remarks today, I will first discuss our results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year ended September 30, then I will provide guidance for the current quarter, and finally, outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for fiscal year 2015.","For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we saw continued momentum with our key drivers, with solid results for both revenue and earnings. Revenue of $465.3 million was above our guided range of $453 million to $463 million, up 6% from the prior quarter and 18% from the fourth quarter a year ago.","GAAP EPS was $1.26 per share, above our guided range of $1.15 to $1.18 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.57 also exceeded our guidance of $1.46 to $1.49 per share.","Q4 product revenue of $255.5 million, up 8% from Q3 and 20% from the fourth quarter of last year, represented 55% of revenue. Service revenue of $209.8 million increased 3% sequentially, 15% year-over-year and accounted for 45% of revenue.","On a regional basis, the Americas grew 16% year-over-year and represented 59% of revenue. EMEA grew 22% year-over-year and accounted for 22% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 14% of revenue, increased 25% year-over-year. And Japan, at 5% of revenue, grew 4% from a year ago.","Enterprise customers represented 67% of Q4 total sales. Service providers accounted for 19% and government sales were 13%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.","During the quarter, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 16.9% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 16.3%; and Avnet at 14%.","Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.5%. GAAP operating expenses of $235.8 million were within our $232 million to $240 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $212.8 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31.7% and non-GAAP operating margin was 37.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.2% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.5%, in line with our forecast.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $170 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.13 billion at year-end. For all of fiscal 2014, cash flow from operations totaled $549 million.","DSO was 47 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $24.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $636.7 million.","In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.32 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $113.21 per share for a total of $150 million. Approximately $331 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.","During the quarter, we added 90 employees, ending the year with approximately 3,835 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 480 employees, an increase of 14%.","For the full year, with a strong close to our fiscal year, F5 exited 2014 with record top line and bottom line results, reflecting solid year-over-year revenue and earnings growth. Revenue for all fiscal 2014 was $1.73 billion, up 16.9% from fiscal 2013.","Product revenue of $936.1 million was up 17.2% from the prior year and accounted for 54% of total revenue. Service revenue of $795.9 million grew 16.6% during the year and represented 46% of the total.","GAAP net income for fiscal 2014 was $311.2 million or $4.09 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $413 million or $5.43 per share.","Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '15 outlook. Entering fiscal 2015, we are encouraged by the strength of our enterprise business, growing demand for our security products, the success of our Good, Better, Best bundles in driving larger deals, and broader adoption of our solutions. We continue to drive our leadership position in cloud with strong and maturing partnerships with industry leaders such as Cisco, HP, Microsoft and VMware, and accelerating growth of our Virtual Edition product set. In addition, we continue to win large deals in service providers with both our traditional traffic-steering solutions and telco-specific offerings such as Policy Enforcement Manager, CGNAT, and Traffix Diameter products. We also plan to formally roll out Versafe and Defense.Net as subscription services to our sales force during the current quarter. And we believe these new security offerings will meaningfully expand our addressable market opportunity. On the strength of these ongoing drivers and incremental solutions, we anticipate another year of solid growth and profitability in fiscal 2015.","In preparing our Q1 guidance, we have factored in typical seasonality that we see with the start of a new fiscal year and common with peers in the tech industry. With this in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we are targeting revenue in a range of $460 million to $470 million. We expect GAAP gross margins in the 82% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 83.5%.","We estimate GAAP operating expense of $245 million to $253 million, including approximately $28 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 38.5% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.10 to $1.13 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.46 to $1.49 per share.","We believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $180 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by approximately 100 to 125 employees during the quarter.","Looking out to the year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year are as follows. We believe with our expanding product portfolio, growing customer awareness and adoption of Synthesis architecture, our partnerships with key players in the emerging SDN market and assuming no material impact to the industry from broader macro issues, we will drive year-over-year product revenue growth throughout fiscal 2015.","We also expect to see, from the base of Q1, sequential growth in our business with a traditionally strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate that non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 83% to 84% range. With our expectations of revenue for fiscal '15, we anticipate continued investment in our business to drive top line growth. As such, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to trend in a similar fashion to fiscal year '14, in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and increasing through the second half.","Capital expenditures are expected to range from $6 million to $12 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments. We also anticipate additional CapEx of $15 million to $20 million in the second half of the year, with expansions of our facilities in both San Jose and Tel Aviv expected to come online in the summer of 2015.","We expect stock compensation to increase in Q2 $5 million to $7 million, and then remain roughly at Q2 levels through the rest of the year. And finally, assuming the R&D tax credit is not extended during fiscal 2015, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 38.5% on a GAAP basis and 35.5% on a non-GAAP basis for the year.","As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor Meeting will be November 13. We hope you can join us as our executive team presents the company's strategy and go-to-market plans for F5.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I am sure that you all have seen the announcement regarding my decision to retire at the end of fiscal 2015 that was sent out today. I just wanted to say a few words about my decision, and then we will move on to the business in hand.","It was a really difficult decision. I'll be 64 years old in February. And when I retire at the end of the fiscal year, I will be approaching the 65-year milestone. Just be clear, this was a personal decision that my wife and I agreed to, and frankly, was made harder by my profound affection for F5, our business and the F5 team. You will hear me repeat this in my quarterly remarks, but I feel really excited about the prospects open to F5 in the future, and my decision was in no way related to any negative business considerations. F5 has an awesome array of bench strength in the executive team and throughout the entire organization. My focus for 2015 is simple: number one, deliver world-class business results every quarter; and number two, work closely with our board to have a smooth and effective transition plan for my successor.","Okay. Let's move on to talk about our business.","I'll take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2014, talk in more detail about our Q4 results, and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2015.","I was very pleased with our overall performance in fiscal 2014. The F5 team delivered overall revenue growth of 17%. This growth was split equally between Services and product growth, both at 17%. We also delivered world-class operating margins each quarter, including a non-GAAP operating margin of 37.8% in the final quarter of the year. We exited fiscal 2014 with a stellar balance sheet, with over $1.1 billion in cash and investments, having purchased $651 million of our common stock during the year. We increased our headcount by 480, ending the year with 3,835 employees.","There were many highlights in fiscal 2014. Our security solutions are driving a significant number of sales wins, including many multimillion-dollar transactions. Approximately 36% of our total product sales last year included one or more security products, and this represents 41% growth over fiscal 2013.","We added significant functionality to our web application firewall and access solutions, ASM and APM, and we expect to see continuing demand for these products as the complexity and sophistication of application attacks continue. There is clearly an urgent and growing requirement for customers to protect their applications in on-premise data centers and in private and public clouds.","Fiscal 2014 was a forceful year of sales of our traditional firewall solution, ASM. ASM sales have grown significantly in the year, and we have won several large transactions where we replaced the incumbent competitive solutions. Project wins have included both data center firewall solutions and Gi firewall solutions with Tier 1 service providers. Our Gi firewalls are situated between a service provider's mobile network -- radio network and the Internet, and is ideal for protecting subscribers from complex attacks, such as large DDoS threats.","We also significantly expanded our portfolio of subscription security solutions this past year. We added our Secure Web Gateway product, our Versafe anti-malware and anti-phishing subscription service via our Security Operations Centers, and we completed the acquisition of Defense.Net, earning a high-capacity, cloud-based service for protecting data centers from DDoS attacks. These cloud-based protection capabilities are complementary to our on-premise DDoS solution that I referred to earlier. This combination provides our customers with the most comprehensive, hybrid DDoS solution in the market, engineered to absorb the full threat spectrum of DDoS attacks.","Although we have seen customer orders already for both the new cloud-based DDoS service and the anti- malware and phishing solutions, we have yet to formally release these solutions to our global sales force and partner channel. We plan to introduce these additional solutions next week at our international sales conference, along with training programs and sales collateral.","The team also delivered a strong performance in the service provider market last year. I already mentioned the opportunity we have with our security products in the service provider market, especially with our Gi firewall solution. We also saw increased traction with our Policy Enforcement module, PEM, which provides integrated subscriber and application awareness, traffic steering, reporting and policy enforcement.","Another area where we have seen good success in the year with service providers comes from our unique capability with TCP protocol optimization. We introduced 7 specific optimizations last year in the TMOS Vancouver and Alpine releases. These optimizations improve TCP performance when the network is experiencing packet loss and\/or network congestion, typically caused by the explosion of mobile data traffic. This allows for significant cost savings by the mobile service provider, as well as providing a faster service to subscribers.","Although the functionality is targeted to LTE and 4G applications, it also helps improve general data center performance, especially within virtualized data centers, where virtualized applications can burst traffic at rates exceeding 10 gigabits per second.","We have also made significant progress with our Traffix Diameter solutions for LTE rollouts. Our competitive win rate is very high and we now have approximately 40 projects currently in production, with several other projects in process. In addition, I would like to point out that we now have Tier 1 service provider production wins in all theaters. These projects can be complex and very mission-critical, and we expect our focus in the next few months to be concentrated on project delivery and project rollout.","We've made great progress with the product refresh opportunity throughout the year. The feedback from both existing customers and new prospects has been excellent, and I believe this opportunity will continue throughout fiscal 2015.","Our installed base currently includes over 75,000 systems that have been installed for 3 years or more, approximately 40% of the installed base, which is clearly a good refresh opportunity.","Another highlight last year was our progress and increasing traction with software sales, including software modules running on TMOS and software-only Virtual Edition solutions. Both our software attach rate and our Virtual Edition sales have increased steadily throughout the year. Customer reaction to Good, Better, Best -- the Good, Better, Best sales strategy has been fantastic, and I will give some specific deal details in Q4 GBB sales when I talk about our Q4 performance. Our software-only virtualization solutions continue to gain traction, with annual revenue growth up more than 49% from fiscal 2013.","Fiscal 2014 was another great year for extending our technology leadership. I already mentioned the new cloud-based DDoS service, the new anti-malware and phishing solutions and the Secure Web Gateway product. We also introduced DDI integration with our APM access solution for VMware Horizon. We released BIG-IQ, our new orchestration and management platform, with 3 modules for cloud bursting, security and device management. And we delivered significant cloud and SDN integration with VMware, Cisco, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Alcatel-Lucent and OpenStack.","In addition, we introduced over 300 major new features across 2 major releases of TMOS. We achieved significant enhancements with our VE performance, with 10 gigabits per second available for most hypervisors. And we introduced the next-generation iControl on BIG-IP using REST to support software-defined data center and cloud-based architectures. We also added a first-ever 2U 2-slot chassis as an entry-level VIPRION product.","I believe our competitive position and technology leadership is as strong as it's ever been. A good example of our competitive strength is demonstrated by our success in the Cisco ACE replacement opportunity, with another solid year of revenue from new customer ACE replacements and solid growth from existing replacements for additional sales in areas like security. We believe that our total replacements to date account for significantly less than 50% of the ACE installed base, and we expect the opportunity to continue throughout 2015 and beyond.","Our Services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2014 and contributed to be a significant profit -- and continued to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor, while maintaining customer satisfaction at world-class levels. The attach rate of service to product sales continued to improve, and we once again experienced excellent renewal rates. We also continue to grow our consulting business, with increase -- which increases customer satisfaction and drives additional product revenues.","Perhaps the most exciting achievement in 2014 is how we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of the potentially revolutionary and disruptive trends currently facing the technology industry. These include the accelerating adoption of public and private clouds and SDN architectures, the explosion of mobile data and LTE rollouts, complex global security threats and software-defined everything. I believe that the progress we have made with our Synthesis architecture, our technology partner ecosystem and SDN partnerships, our move into open cloud and subscription services, combined with our new pricing and business models, all combined, position us strongly for the future.","Synthesis allows our customers and partners to build future-proof architectures that support on-premise solutions with the opportunity to scale to private or public clouds, as requirements dictate.","As far as Q4 is concerned, I was very happy with the performance. From a sales perspective, we saw year-over-year growth in all our major regions, with especially strong results in EMEA and North America and good improvement in Asia Pacific and Japan. We also saw a marked increase in larger deals, especially million-dollar-plus deals during the quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. We continued to experience strong momentum with our Good, Better, Best sales most [ph] in Q4, with customer adoption continuing to be very strong in the Best category. Our Services business delivered another strong quarter with a solid increase in deferred revenue, which now totals $637 million.","Lastly, we are very proud to have been positioned as a leader in the Magic Quadrant for Application Delivery Controllers for 8 consecutive years.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy stated our guidance range for Q1 and the expectations we have for sequential growth throughout fiscal 2015.","We have a world-class sales force, who are efficient and motivated to drive business in the final quarter of the year, and Q4 was no exception. As usual, this leads to seasonality in Q1, which is normal in the technology market and in line with our peers. As I have mentioned several times, we believe the business drivers we have experienced in fiscal 2014 hold firm in fiscal 2015.","In addition, some of the new business drivers that are subscription-based, such as Versafe anti-malware solutions and our cloud-based DDoS service, will pay dividends in a phased approach throughout the year and in the future. I believe we are uniquely well-positioned to take advantage of the significant market trends which are occurring today, and we intend to continue investing throughout the year to take advantage of these exciting opportunities.","I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their tremendous efforts last year, and I look forward to their continued support for fiscal 2015.","And with that, we'll now hand over the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ittai Kidron, Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","John, congratulations on your decision. I had a couple of questions. First for you, John, with regards to the succession plan. Do you have any view on whether the next year will be from within or without the company? And second question for you, Andy, on the service provider side for 3 quarters in a row, flat to down sequentially. Clearly, you have some big opportunities and you're making some good traction there. Can you give us a little bit more color on what's not working so well? It seems like there's no growth in that business. And what's kind of holding this back?","John McAdam","Yes, okay. This is John. Succession planning, as I mentioned, is clearly a top priority for the board and myself, as I mentioned in the beginning of my delivery. We are absolutely -- and I want to be very, very clear on this. I'm also very, very committed to delivering world-class quarters during the year as well. But clearly, succession planning is a top priority. I mentioned that we've got tremendous bench strength in F5 right now. So you can draw your own conclusions from that. But what we're going to do with the board is we're going to be focused on this subject, we're going to do it properly, it's going to be smooth, it's going to be professional, and I feel pretty comfortable with that. That's really all that I'm going to say on that subject right now.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Very good. And now the service provider?","Andy Reinland","Yes, so we've talked a lot about in the service provider space, so we see it as being a lumpy business for us. We still feel good about the pipeline. We feel good about what we're seeing, but clearly, we're not hitting that 20% to 25% kind of target that we talk about. But I wouldn't call out anything that I think -- maybe just softer spending, but nothing specific that I could call out relative to us and our experience with service providers that I'd highlight is something to worry about.","John McAdam","Yes, in fact, I mean, I think the -- we're pretty excited. I am, and so is the service provider team, about the TCP optimization stuff that we've done during the year. I wouldn't underestimate that opportunity. Basically for heavy traffic, it's a great money-saver for the -- and increases the quality for the service providers. Traffix, we feel really good about. I did mention, however, that this -- the short term, and that's probably towards the end of this year. We're very focused on making sure these big, pretty significant, complex projects we're working on with Tier 1 people goes smoothly. So that's going to be our main focus, but you'll start to see that ramp again, I'm pretty sure, as we move into the calendar 2015. And then security, security is a big one. I mean, we're starting to see traction with the Gi firewall. We've still got a lot of POCs, proof of concepts, going on. We've had orders, million-dollar-plus orders on that, and that could be very big for us. So I think there's a whole bunch of things going on there. And PEM, I mentioned, the traction in that as well.","Manuel F. Rivelo","And this is Manny. The only thing I would add to that is a lot of the footprints that we're going into are new footprints, and that means that they take long proof of concepts. John highlighted all of those. They're inserting ourselves into critical components of the network beyond the traditional traffic steering. And simultaneous with that, what we're seeing for service providers, and we are doing dozens of proof of concepts right now, is a movement to network function virtualization. So we're starting to see that also. So obviously, service providers are going through a massive transformation. Our technology is critical because it continues to drive more towards subscriber and application awareness, and movement from hardware to software or a mix of hardware and software to NFV. So that's going to take a little bit of time, but we're really excited with the progress across the board, everything that John and Andy mentioned.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So Manny, does that mean you do not expect an inflection point necessarily in the service provider this year? It could take a little bit longer before all this work just starts delivering?","John McAdam","There's no way we would say that. I think that'll be prudent not to say that. It is lumpy. If we hit it off with the Gi firewall, that could be interesting.","Operator","Next question from Pierre Ferragu, Bernstein.","Pierre Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","On the security front, you mentioned that as being like a very important driver for growth today. And I'd really like to understand how you see your position in the market evolving and who you actually compete with. So I know it's kind of like a question you've had very often, and it's kind of a silly question, but I still don't understand whether your clients, when they look for a security solution, consider you guys as well as they would consider like a traditional security player, like a Palo Alto, or if you guys actually sell security as an additional feature on your platform, but you don't really face traditional firewall players in competitive bids.","John McAdam","Yes, this is John. I'll just take a minute, and I think Manny and Karl can give you much more detail. The key to understand us is our position in the data center and our strength there. So most of our security solutions -- and we have access solutions as well to the mobile devices. But the key to understanding our strength is, a, we're all about the application, we're really well-placed in the data center and we have massive performance advantages. So with that, maybe Karl and Manny could give you more detail.","Karl D. Triebes","Yes, I'll start. This is Karl. Yes, John tried. Our focus has been the application. I mean, that started when we acquired Magnifire 10 years ago to focus on web application firewalling. And with that, we integrated that as part of our BIG-IP portfolio because we needed -- we wanted the scalability, and we've significantly added to its capabilities along the line, but the focus has been on the application. Then we added things like APM for doing things like remote access, single sign-on, build the front-end applications. And the more general discussion around security is that because we sit in the data center, and because we interact at the transactional level, we're a proxy and we're able to see both sides of the transaction, both from the client and back from the server, and understand the context of the application, we can imply -- we can apply intelligence to that connection that other security devices can't do, such as like a Palo Alto, which sits at the perimeter, which is doing distinctly different types of security services, whereas, we're focused, again, back at the application tier. There's other things that we do there as well. For example, now, we acquired Versafe to provide antifraud services. Again, because we're involved with the transactions, with the fraud -- in between the client and the server, we're able to form a trusted connection with the client dynamically and then send certain conditions and then prevent and detect these different conditions as part of that. And so our focus on security has been effectively preventing attacks against applications. Now we're extending our footprint in the data center, meaning providing other types of security, and you'll see more of that. We're advancing our DDoS capabilities. We're looking at ways to provide risk assessment, other advanced analytics as part of that, and we'll extend from there.","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes, and this is Manny. I'll just add a couple more things to that because I think it was well-covered. The other stuff that's really important to note is that we also view the new -- there's a new perimeter in most enterprises. The perimeter, which was classically the Internet boundary wall, is no longer the case because we have devices that we bring into the corporate environment. So we're doing a lot of work around identity being the new perimeter and the way users access into the network. That's a very large growing business for us. It's our APM business. And the last piece I'll point out is as an ADC, we not only provide security services, we provide availability services and acceleration services, all simultaneously. So that gives us a very strong foothold into these accounts because we're not providing 3 separate devices to secure, accelerate and make an application highly available. We simultaneously provide that based on contextualization of the user accessing the application. So that's really been our strategy and it's taking hold in the market segment.","Operator","Next question from Catharine Trebnick, Dougherty Networks.","Catharine Anne Trebnick - Dougherty & Company LLC, Research Division","This, I guess, is for Manny and Karl. Could you tell me roughly how many different use cases you would see in the different operators? I think that would help with -- because you're getting a lot of traction with Traffix and PEM, but like let's take a Tier 1 operator versus a Tier 2 operator. And how many different use cases would they use of F5 today versus maybe perhaps a year ago?","Manuel F. Rivelo","Well, Catharine, it's Manny. It's hard to -- I don't have year-on-year comparisons. So it's hard to give you that, but I'll show you when we -- on 2 weeks, when we're over at the Analyst Conference, I'll show you 11 use cases that we're selling aggressively into service providers this year. I'd have to go back and tell you how many we're doing last year. But above and beyond that, what we're seeing with service providers is not only the standard use cases we sell around TCP optimization, firewall security, application security, the list goes on and on, but we're also seeing service providers use the extensibility of our product, the openness of the platform, allowing them to program the platform to solve their unique application, traffic-steering problems and\/or application problems inside that environment. And that's the power of iRules, iApps, et cetera. So it's hard to put your finger on it because we quite often get going in solving some of their application challenges when other products can't, and that's because of the capability. In addition to that, we're seeing huge momentum with them, as I said, on NFV and VEs as we go across the board. So I'll share more of that with you in 2 weeks, and you could see a slide that has the actual use cases that we're going out aggressively after.","Operator","The next question, Brent Bracelin, Pacific Crest Securities.","Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","John, I also wish you the best on your pending retirement here. It's certainly been an impressive run as you kind of built this from a $100 million business to a company that looks like it's well on its way to a $2 billion company. You certainly will be missed. Two questions for me. One, John, in light of mixed results across the networking space, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the pipeline visibility going into the December quarter this year versus last year. Do you see anything kind of abnormal? Or the mixed results that you're seeing across some of your peers is something maybe perhaps you're not seeing? Any color there would be helpful.","John McAdam","Yes. No, no, I don't see anything abnormal. I mean, as I was saying, we have a pretty good sales force, and they know what Q4 is all about. They have accelerated and they're focused. They have a sales club and they drive Q4 business. So normally, and the emphasis on normally, you will always see that the pipeline goes down somewhat because they close so much business, and that's the same as it was last year. But in terms of our like-for-like, we're seeing growth opportunities across the board and these drivers we've talked about.","Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's certainly helpful. And then, Andy, a quick question for you around Services. I know we have the drag of slower product growth a year ago, dragging overall Services down. But as we think about the slowdown here to 14%, 15% growth this quarter, do you think this is kind of the low watermark and we should stabilize here? Or what's the visibility into the Services maintenance business? And when do you think that could start to reaccelerate?","Andy Reinland","Yes. I mean, the expectation is clearly for it to flatten out this year. I mean, we've come through the last 3 quarters of 20% product growth sequentially. That's going to create that pull. So every expectation is we'll see that start to trend more positively this fiscal.","John McAdam","And then from a visibility point, if you -- frankly, it's pretty good.","Andy Reinland","Yes, with the deferred revenue that we have, well over $600 million. Over 75% of that is current. So that gives us a good anchor when we do our analysis on the coming year.","Operator","Next question comes from Vlad Rom, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Vlad Rom - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Andy, just a quick question on the guidance. So if you look at it, and you assume a little bit of deceleration on the Services line, it looks like product seasonality is perhaps more towards the low end of historic performance, just in terms of the guidance. How would -- how should we be thinking about the puts and takes embedded in the guidance? So kind of the security, sounds like it's a positive, potential rollouts on the service provider side, but can you talk about the puts and takes? And then, also, a follow-on question on the Virtual Edition. If you're seeing any potential dilution in terms of revenue with the acceleration in that product?","Andy Reinland","Yes, so we actually don't normally comment prospectively between products and service in our guidance. We pretty much let it stand. I'd go back to our comments on seasonality. When you're looking at year-over-year, if you go back and look at our guidance from a year ago relative to our results and messaging, I think you'll see similar analysis. And as John said, we're not seeing much different -- distinctly different from a year ago, and I'll leave it at that. And VE?","John McAdam","Yes, we are not seeing a dilution at all with the VE-type solutions. They tend to be very different from an architecture nature. They tend to be very horizontal in design. And typically, we're seeing some really big ones as well. I mean, there was an extremely big one in the federal space, for example, last quarter. And that -- when I say big, I usually mean more than $1 million. And they're solutions that we probably wouldn't actually be involved in, if it was pure appliance-type sales. So we're not seeing much of that at all. Maybe over time, we will, but certainly not anytime soon.","Operator","Next question, Erik Suppiger, JMP Securities.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","First off, congratulations, John, on your decision. Best of luck. First off, I'm curious on the web app firewall. Do you think that you're taking share in that market? Or can you comment a little bit on some of the competitive dynamics that you've seen in that market over the last, say, over the course of this year?","John McAdam","Yes. Manny?","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes. So yes, we feel very comfortable that we're taking share in that market segment. We just actually had a -- NSS Labs, who ran a large test on our firewall relative to everybody else's firewall, and we scored incredibly well on that. We're also seeing huge traction from our customer base across the deployment of web application firewall. And I think what you'll see is in the future us also putting our web application firewall out into the cloud. As we continue to expand our cloud-based solutions, bring that out. That will give us a full portfolio of services on-prem as well as the services in the cloud. So we feel really comfortable. We have great technology, great performance and a very, very low false positive score, which is really important in the sense that we don't see a lot of noise on the network. We actually see real vulnerabilities.","John McAdam","We think the WAP solution is -- I mean, it's going to be great for on-premise, and it will stay that way for a long, long time with all the policies it can do to protect the apps. As a service, we think it's got great potential. Julian's organization is working aggressively on that to provide it as a service. We'll have it in this fiscal year. And I don't know if you want to say anything about that Julian?","Edward Julian Eames","So we're targeting April with an upside of trying get it ready for February, but April's the plan. And with the DDoS service in front of that, we'll announce that next week. And we've opened all the data centers, so we're ready to take orders on that as well.","John McAdam","So this is -- because I know these are scripted, but I think Julian indeed say February. Now having said that, it's going to be during the year. We're not going to -- I don't want to be too specific. But very fast.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","How's the win rate on that, on the web app firewall? Has that changed much during the course of this fiscal year?","John McAdam","Yes, I'd say it's the same. I mean, we do check the competitive runway and it's high, but I don't know the answer to that, Erik.","Manuel F. Rivelo","I mean, it's been -- Erik, this is Manny. It's been high always, as John pointed out. We haven't seen any material difference in that. If we don't see an account, we could lose it, of course. And the other place that we've had a couple of losses over the course of the last couple of years is when a customer doesn't want to deploy it on-prem, but instead wants to deploy it in the cloud, right? And that's part of the driver also to put our solution in the cloud. So absolutely not. At this point in time, I would say it's the same as it's been historically for us.","John McAdam","And the only thing is that GBB, one of the main differentiators between GBB as Best versus Best -- and one of the mains, it's not the only one, is ASM, the WAP solution. So we will take a look at this. And when we talk in 2 weeks' time, we'll maybe give you some more data.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. One other quick question on the server market. Does the end of support for Microsoft's Windows 2003, does that play much of a role in terms of your demand drivers? Is there much of a refresh cycle coming over the remainder of the support contracts there?","Karl D. Triebes","This is Karl. I don't think there's a big impact there because, largely, we're not tied to a specific operating system. And with the movement to the cloud, with the rise of Linux, with other things that are going out there with VMware and other things, I think we're more closely correlated to that than we are a specific operating system or anything around that because we haven't seen anything to date.","Operator","Next question from Bill Choi with Janney.","William H. Choi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","John, also, congratulations. It's been quite a run over the 15 years. I guess, I wanted to get your -- some sense of what you mean by, I guess, strive for world-class quarterly performance. Beginning of last year, you certainly set your #1 priority in accelerating product growth. Any way to tie this back into the product growth perspective?","John McAdam","Well, yes. So we -- one of the things we do every year in the company, and we'll be rolling it out actually tomorrow, but we have something called the vital queue, and we have a number of -- many are actions that we want to do, for example, SDN partnerships, and you could probably guess a number of them. And then we normally have some financial goals as well. And obviously, just because I'm going to talk about one goal doesn't mean we want to be -- don't want the other goals to increase. But the main focus for this year, again, is product growth. That's always #1 for us.","William H. Choi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And you're starting to partner with Cisco. That was a profound change in your relationship. I want to also get a sense of how much you're benefiting from that relationship. If you could give any sense of how big your channel partnerships have gotten? What kind of ACE replacements you've already had? Any color on that would be great.","John McAdam","Well, yes, the ACE replacement has been extremely significant through the year, very, very strong. And we haven't got specific revenue numbers to give you, but they're very, very strong. The number of add-ons to existing ACE replacements is in the millions, quite often it's a Fortune 500 organization. So we feel very good about that. Every QBR, quarterly business review, one of the things that we ask the sales management to talk about is the relationship with our partners like Cisco and VMware, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, companies like that. Because our whole goal is not just about ACE, it's all about partnering with these companies. So it's a win-win, and they gain something from the relationship, and so do we. And the progress in that, with the companies I just mentioned, has been pretty significant.","William H. Choi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Isn't that -- that's where your larger deals are coming from?","John McAdam","Yes, a lot of it is influenced by that type of business. Not all of it, but a lot of it.","Manuel F. Rivelo","This is Manny. Just to add to that. John mentioned some of the key networking companies there, HP, Cisco, VMware and Microsoft. We've integrated with all of those companies our Synthesis architecture, our software-defined application services, Layer 4 through 7, with their SDN technology stacks. So obviously, where VMware would be something like NSX; with Cisco, it would be more of their ACI, APIC infrastructure; HVN with Microsoft, et cetera. But we've gone beyond that in those partnerships, in those integrations in the sense that with certain partnerships, we're also integrating with their security stacks, with their cloud stacks, and we have joint go-to-market and channel motions across the board. So the ecosystem there is broad and the ecosystem there has actual go-to-market activity associated with that. So yes, we should expect continued growth in those relationships throughout the year.","William H. Choi - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Can you quantify the channel base, I guess, for the year?","John McAdam","No, I don't think we'll qualify that -- quantify. But we will, by the way, talk in a lot more detail. And Eldridge just reminded me here, in 2 weeks' time. That is a specific. Again, the topic is what we're doing with these partners. You will hear a lot more about it with some interesting use cases.","John Eldridge","Okay. This is John Eldridge. We're going to take 3 more questions, and then we're going to wrap it up.","Operator","Next question from Tal Liani, Bank of America.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The service -- in the 5 of the last 6 quarters, product growth was stronger than service growth, which is always -- or sometimes, it's a sign that service growth accelerates over the next few quarters. So can you speak about the dynamics of Services versus products? And should the stronger product growth be a leading indicator for acceleration of Services or not? Just the puts and takes there.","Edward Julian Eames","Tal, this is Julian. There is a relationship. It can span over 3 quarters to 4 quarters depending on where the product has been sold, whether it's refresh or not. But I think you see the indicator of it in the deferred balance that's grown by 20% and 22% in the last 2 quarters.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So does it mean that when you look at next year and the following year, I mean, without the timeframe and without the numbers, but it means that you're looking for service growth to accelerate if I just interpret your comment?","Edward Julian Eames","We think we're on the bottom now, and we'll start to see an increase as the reflection of that additional product sales comes in as layers on top of the service sales.","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Any reason for the recurring revenue growth as a percentage of sales to also increase outside of the normal services growth?","Edward Julian Eames","Can you say that again?","John McAdam","[indiscernible] you're talking about or...","Tal Liani - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So any outside of -- I'm asking if when we go to cloud and we go to different business models of service model -- or sorry, software model instead of appliance model, there is also a question about recurring revenues. And I wanted to know what is your outlook for the recurring revenue part? Outside of the maintenance fee that you're getting on appliances, what do you think will happen to recurring revenue part of your business?","Andy Reinland","Yes, so we talked about just in next week, we're going to be launching 2 subscription services with Defense.Net and Versafe. We also have Secure Web Gateway. We think we'll see -- probably later in the year, we'll see sales as we launch this out, but that's going to go into deferred revenues. So you're probably going to see over time where that becomes -- breaking that out becomes more of an important metric on deferred subscription revenue.","John McAdam","And similarly, if we meet our goals in WAF and ASM, you're going to see exactly the same.","Andy Reinland","Yes.","Operator","Okay. Next question from Georgios Kyriakopoulos from SunTrust.","Georgios Kyriakopoulos - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","John, on the Cisco ACE opportunity, you mentioned that less than 50% of the installed base has been replaced. Can you talk about the typical incremental opportunity beyond load balancing?","John McAdam","Again, we will talk about that in a couple of weeks' time in a lot more detail. But we've looked to what we believe, from a market share and historical perspective, what the kind of installed base is. And we believe it's -- you're going to get more data on this. I don't want to be too specific. You're going to see much more than $1 billion, $1.5 billion, probably near that number. We think -- I say 50%. We actually think it's a lot less than 50% that's been covered so far. So we think the opportunity is way more than 50% still out there remaining. And we'll give you more details in that when we meet with you in a couple of weeks.","Operator","Okay. Next question, Jess Lubert, Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions, maybe first for Andy. With the possible exception of the December quarter, is it fair to assume you'd expect product sales to grow sequentially through the upcoming year?","Andy Reinland","Yes, and I said that in my prepared remarks. But yes, we do.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then federal picked up in the quarter, so I was hoping you could talk about what you saw in the market, how you expect federal business to progress. And to what degree that was just a function of some fiscal year-end buying? If there is reason to believe that we should see continued growth as we go into fiscal '15 in federal?","John McAdam","Dave can answer -- give you some more flavor on what we've done in federal. But remember, that was Q4 of course, just ending September. So by definition, that's always been the best growth for us, of course. So we really expect our federal business to be down in this coming quarter, as it always is, just so we're clear. But Dave, do you want to talk about Q4?","Thomas David Feringa","I think in Q4, I mean, I think we had a very solid quarter in federal. We actually, towards the end of the quarter, we thought it had a potential to be even larger, but we saw a couple of things. First of all, our business in the civilian and in the intelligence side of federal has been very, very strong, lots of growth and investments. And certainly, our solutions not only around ADC, but around security and cloud, are doing very, very well. In Department of Defense, we're certainly seeing a pullback. Obviously, our activities in Iraq and Afghanistan are being pulled back. And so Department of Defense is definitely pulling back. But even with that, we're seeing a lot of opportunities going into this year. So we're very bullish on this year. We think intelligence will continue to be a huge driver for us. As Department of Defense and other agencies start to going to cloud and start looking at more efficient ways of delivering services, we think that's going to play very, very well with our strategy. So like the team, I've got a very good team, very, very solid outlook in fed this year.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me, but Grantley-based servers are now in the market. Can you help us understand to what degree the availability of these platforms might drive some incremental customer requirements or refresh activity for some of your products?","Karl D. Triebes","Yes, I mean, the Grantleys add significant performance. As you know, we have a pretty tight relationship with Intel, so we understand pretty far in advance what's coming and what are the specifics of these processors. In fact, we leverage a lot of their technology, as you know, in our products. But in terms of adoption, I mean, yes, it will improve performance, it allows you to run more virtual servers, you can run more applications, you can concentrate more drives, more traffic into the network, and that's all good for us. And what I think it really speaks to is efficiency of the systems on the back end. Because really what's driving the traffic, it's not just server speeds, but it's actually things that are happening on -- with mobile devices and what's happening outside the perimeter of the data center, right, that's driving these trends. So it just makes it more efficient. But yes, we expect that, that helps our case in the data center, if you will.","Andy Reinland","Jess, I wanted to clarify one element to your question that you asked. I didn't hear when you asked about the sequential growth that you were asking specifically about product, and we normally don't guide product. My comments were the total revenue, we expect to see sequential growth. So I just wanted to make that clear.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You don't expect sequential product growth for the year?","Andy Reinland","I didn't say that. It's just specifically what I thought you were asking and what I was answering was based on what we normally give, which is...","John McAdam","We don't normally give that data, and we're still not.","John Eldridge","All right. Thank you all very much for joining us, and I hope you -- all of you can find a way to attend our Analyst Investor Meeting on the 13th of November. I look forward to seeing you there.

Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, John. In a relatively challenging environment, F5 delivered year-over-year revenue growth and strong profitability. Revenue in Q2 grew 2.4% year-over-year to $483.7 million, within our guided range of $480 million to $490 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.68, above our guided range of $1.61 to $1.64 per share. These results exceeded our forecast driven by strength in gross margins and prudent management of expenses, as well as a decrease to our worldwide effective tax rate and the strong buyback of our common stock.","GAAP EPS of $1.11 per share was below our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16 per share due to one-time costs for a patent-related jury verdict and other costs associated with that litigation. The related impact of these one-time costs to GAAP EPS was approximately $0.08.","Product revenue of $225.4 million declined 4% sequentially and 8% year-over-year and represented 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $258.2 million increased 1% sequentially, 13% year-over-year, and accounted for 53% of total revenue.","Revenue from the Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter; EMEA contributed 25%; APAC, 13%; and Japan, 5%. On a year-over-year basis, the Americas were up 1%, EMEA revenue was up 8%, APAC revenue grew 1%, and Japan revenue was down 1%.","Enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21%, and government sales were 16% including 7% of total sales from U.S. federal. In Q2 we had three greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted for 18.2% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which represented 15% of total revenue; and Avnet representing 13.3%.","Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. Including $8.9 million for patent-related jury verdict and other costs associated with that litigation, GAAP operating expenses were $286.5 million, above our guided range of $272 million to $281 million.","Non-GAAP operating expenses, which exclude these patent litigation costs, as well as stock-based compensation and amortization of purchased intangible assets, were $239.8 million. GAAP operating margin was 23.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 34.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.7%.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was $133.1 million. In Q2, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $94.62 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments. At its April meeting, the board approved an additional share repurchase authorization of up to $1 billion.","DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories were $35.2 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $16.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 17% year-over-year to $842.7 million. And we ended the quarter with approximately 4,325 employees, an increase of 50 from the prior quarter.","On to our fiscal Q3 outlook, as we enter into the historically stronger second half of our fiscal year, we remain focused on business execution and the delivery of our upcoming new products and features to drive the next leg of growth for F5. With this in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 is $490 million to $500 million.","GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82.5% range, including approximately $4.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%.","We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $270 million to $279 million. This includes approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 33%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.29 to $1.32 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.77 to $1.80 per share.","We plan to increase our head count by up to 50 employees in the current quarter, and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $155 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Andy; and good afternoon, everyone. Overall, I was pleased with F5 team's fiscal Q2 performance. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 2.4%, with strong profitability and operating margins in a relatively challenging business environment.","From a sales perspective, EMEA, Japan and the Asia Pacific region all delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth. Sales bookings in our America region were down year-over-year in Q2 as we experienced a drop in sales in our two strongest verticals: finance and telco. However, in spite of the shortfall in these verticals, sales from large transactions remained solid in the Americas during the quarter with year-over-year growth from sales in the $1 million-plus category.","Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 13%; also deferred revenue growth 17% year-over-year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business. Our Good, Better, Best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our bookings with year-over-year growth of 25%. As in previous quarters, customer adoption of the Best category remains very strong.","Overall, software revenue also remained strong in Q2 with more than one-third of product revenue coming from software sales driven by security module sales, GBB and software-only VE solutions. Security continues to be the growth driver of our business. We had a number of excellent wins last quarter driven by our application security modules with strong year-over-year growth in large transactions. For example, a global Fortune 25 company invested almost $1 million in the F5 APM solution to enable identity and access management for their employees into the Microsoft Office 365 environment.","Also, we won a project with a U.S. regional airline, who invested nearly $1 million in our on-premise web application firewall to help mitigate malicious and organic DDoS-oriented service interruptions.","Another example was with a telco provider with more than 20 million subscribers which made a significant investment in Silverline anti-DDoS services to thwart attacks orchestrated by an unidentified hacktivist.","We delivered solid sequential and year-over-year growth from Silverline, our cloud-based subscription DDoS and web security services. The pipeline for Silverline services continues to grow, and we continue to invest in additional head count in sales and support resources to take advantage of this growth opportunity.","We also launched an inside sales initiative in Q2, targeting the mid-range market opportunity where there's a real need for application and DDoS protection ideally suited to a subscription service model.","We also had some excellent wins in the hybrid private and public cloud environment. A large European banking customer purchased over several hundred thousand dollars of VE subscription licenses through the AWS marketplace for the deployment of a new customer engagement portal that coexists with the existing infrastructure and will ultimately support more than 10 million customers.","A large SaaS customer invested in VE license through the AWS marketplace to provision Layer 7 local traffic management capabilities on a new platform-as-a-service offering to their installed base.","Another cloud win last quarter involved a large U.S.-based entertainment content provider purchasing VE licenses through the AWS marketplace as part of their lift and shift strategy to move their customer interaction operations into the public cloud.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $490 million to $500 million. In the context of several global macroeconomic issues we delivered strong financial results in Q2, but as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short-term. We have made good progress in all our strategic and major initiatives in Q2. As I mentioned last quarter, we have no shortage of short-term business drivers, which we will introduce starting this current quarter.","Earlier this month, we introduced a new version of TMOS, version 12.1, known internally as the Cascade release. Cascade supports the new 100-gig blade for our high-end VIPRION series which I will talk about shortly. Cascade also makes huge strides to increase F5's leadership in application programmability and application deployment. Cascade introduces F5's next-generation iRules and iApp functionality, called iRulesLX and iAppsLX.","iRulesLX allows users to leverage Node.js libraries to provide new functionality addressing the needs of the DevOps market, as well as customer applications that need customization and programmability. iRulesLX is based on the LineRate technology and is fully integrated in TMOS.","iAppsLX allows for easy programming of specific use cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used web application programming language JavaScript. iAppsLX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN product as it allows use cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ into the various SDN controllers such as the Cisco APIC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature which should give F5 a clear advantage with our SDN partners.","We are on track to deliver a new performance FIPS appliance and LME (15:15) based on the BIG-IP 10000 series appliances. It uses next-generation technology, enabling an eight times improvement in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core requirements in both our financial services and our federal markets.","We successfully demonstrated our 100-gig blade for the high-end VIPRION series platform at Mobile World Congress last quarter. The new VIPRION 100-gig interfaces more than doubles the performance of an existing cards thereby enabling the first-ever terabit-class ADC in the market. We are seeing strong interest in the 100-gig blade from our global service providers and have already received an initial $1 million-plus order for the product. The 100-gig blade is on track for delivery in May and we would expect to see initial revenue from the 100-gig blade this quarter, current Q3, with growing momentum in Q4 and into fiscal 2017.","The new blade runs all TMOS application modules and is targeted at service provider applications including Gi firewall, Carrier-Grade NAT, and intelligent traffic steering. BIG-IQ release 5 is also on track for release this quarter and we are very encouraged by the customer reaction to the new functionality and scalability improvement that are included in the release. Release 5 includes centralized management for all security products including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi Firewall, and WebSafe anti-fraud. It also adds new device management capabilities, ADC management and application analytics.","I mentioned in last quarter's call that we plan to expand our product portfolio by adding purpose-built security products which will address new markets. The initial release will include an SSL Intercept and SSL Air Gap solution, as well as a standalone DDoS solution with new behavioral and intelligence capabilities. There have been some small changes in the delivery schedule for these two products. The initial release of the SSL Intercept and Air Gap products will now be available in early-July; and the standalone DDoS product should be available slightly earlier than expected with availability towards the end of this current quarter.","It's worth noting that we have already won large SSL Intercept projects using our existing iRules on our current ADC range of products. The initial version of the standalone SSL Intercept solution will use our existing iApp technology to allow much simpler implementation. This will then be enhanced further by using the new iAppLX (sic) [iAppsLX] (18:01) functionality in a later release.","We're also making good progress to release a 40-gig capable version of our software VE solution. Intel demonstrated our F5 VE solution in a 100-gig environment at Mobile World Congress and received a lot of interest from service providers who have the goal of driving NFV architectures in the future.","Progress on our plan to deliver a comprehensive appliance refresh is going well and we are on track to commence delivery of the new products in July and have all products available within a three-month to four-month window.","The new appliances, known internally as the Shuttle series, significantly improve performance, decrease total cost of ownership and increase our competitive leadership. However, the Shuttle series is much more than a simple product line upgrade. The Shuttle series is DevOps-friendly, encompasses a full stack of security solutions and offers specific persona-based customized solutions using our proprietary FPGA software-defined hardware functionality.","The Shuttle series will support our application modules across the entire product lineup and are designed to support and enable two-tier architectures including hybrid clouds. Our high-level goal with the Shuttle series is to bridge the gap between traditional IT, the DevOps environments and the emerging cloud architectures.","I continue to believe F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. Our absolute focus is on execution with the primary goal of delivering product revenue growth. And I believe this goal will be achieved as we deliver the new product business drivers to the market.","We have added several key executives to the F5 team last quarter to support and enhance our focus on execution. You may have seen recent press releases announcing the appointment of key sales and security executives to F5.","I'm really excited to have Pete Brant, David Helfer and Mike Convertino in the F5 team. Pete joins us as SVP for North American Sales and brings with him a fantastic track record with more than 20 years of experience in technology and security sales. David joins us as VP of Worldwide Channels and brings extensive experience in global channels and sales operations, again with a fantastic track record. Mike is F5's first Chief Information Security Officer. His first priority is the continued protection of the company's customer assets and data. Mike will also play a lead role in the development of F5's securities product roadmap and represent F5 in the IT industry and wider security community.","In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, I'll hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is now open.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi.","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Alex.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","So, just a couple of very quick, detailed questions. Can you tell us what the actual ending share count was given how much you guys are buying back?","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, our fully weighted diluted share count for the end of Q2 was 67,000,804.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","No, that's the average. What's the actual ending?","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just give us a second...","Unknown Speaker","Give us a second, Alex, and we'll get that to you.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","And then the second question on the linearity in the quarter, you clearly had some angst in the broader marketplace in January and February. It seems to have gradually resolved itself over the course of the last month of the quarter and into April. Has that been your experience over the course of the quarter? Was it soft in January\/February and then improved linearly over the course of the quarter? Can you give us some sense of what's happening?","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","To some degree that was the case. So, obviously, January and February, we did see some angst. We started to get a little bit worried about visibility, but obviously we check linearity weekly, and it wasn't a disaster, but it wasn't probably as good as we would've liked to have been.","We did see visibility start to clean up towards the end of the quarter, which was obviously encouraging, because that was slightly different from last quarter, where I said almost the opposite.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","And if I could, just on that same subject, would the financial segment, because of how awful their business was in the quarter, be one area that didn't do that?","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. No, no. We actually had some pretty strong transactions towards the end of the quarter that we expected in the financial segment. And by the way, Alex, I mentioned in my script that obviously financial and telco were down somewhat. They weren't down a significant amount; well, finance in particular wasn't down that much. Telco was actually down more.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks.","Unknown Speaker","Alex, the number you were looking for was 66,000,981.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is RK (23:51) on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the enterprise spending weakness that you're seeing and what's driving that. So, do you think it's all driven by just the macro weakness or, I mean, EMC today, earlier today talked about how they're seeing customers pausing spending as they look at the various different cloud architectures. Do you see some of that too?","And I was also wondering if you think that customers are pausing spending ahead of your upcoming product research? Thanks.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So pretty much similar to what we said last quarter; in other words we do see macro. We don't think it's a strong spending environment in general out there, but we are also, in our opinion, we think there are delays in spending caused by customers effectively strategizing over the new cloud architectures and what applications they should take and basically planning that. So I think we're seeing some slowness because of the transformation in architecture. So that's two reasons.","I must admit that I think there's another reason. I mean, over time, we've seen some disruption, and it's been well publicized in management. And I think that's behind us now. I talked about some of the hiring that John DiLullo, in particular, has done over the last couple of quarters and (25:22) back in charge in North America, and I feel really good about that. But, the two big ones for us are really the macro combined with the fact that the cloud architectures, and you combine those two together and that makes it easy to make a delay in the spending decision.","And then in terms of the Osborne (25:43) type question that you asked about, not really. I can't say we're seeing much of that, we're watching it like a hawk especially this quarter because I did say that the big product shipments which is the Shuttle series is now destined for July, so we're feeling good about really getting a good date now that's pretty soon. And I think we're going to be okay with that, but we're watching it very, very closely.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Robison with Wunderlich. Your line is now open.","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Hey, thanks. So, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on the TCO benefits for Shuttle series. I'm trying to get my arms around what's going to stimulate an installed base upgrade cycle.","Karl D. Triebes - Chief Technical Officer & EVP-Product Development","Yeah, I mean \u2013 hi, this is Karl. Real quick, there's a few things. One is, typically every time we release new appliances, the new generation tends to be, on average, about two times to four times faster for the equivalent price points. And so, we certainly are moving forward in that direction with these.","All of these appliances also now support FPGAs, all the way down the lineup. And so, as John mentioned in his script, we're going to be supporting these use case driven versions of these FPGAs for specific scenarios like security or other areas where you can optimize the platform depending on how you're going to use it.","So, for example, with security, if you want to block, say, IP addresses, you can do that in hardware. Or for like private cloud scenarios and data centers, you'll be able to connect things transparently through the hardware versus doing it through having to balance everything through the CPU. So, you get not only benefits from just the back-end horsepower, but also from the ability to offload a lot of functionality into the hardware and the appliance.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And also with the performance improvement you get more modules on a single system than you would normally get. So there's a bunch of areas there, but I actually think the big one \u2013 and that's why I said it's not just a product line upgrade, because we're going to get all that good stuff, and hopefully the customers will benefit from the savings that they get. But, more importantly, SS bridge (28:01) we see as a bridge between the existing on-premise architectures and the cloud with some of the stuff that we can do that Karl mentioned on FPGAs to tunnel connectivity between private and public clouds and these products.","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. So a part of it is, when you say offload that sounds like maybe you're pulling some wallet share from some other adjacent types of products. I know you've mentioned the SSL Intercept. But, are you talking about those kind of (28:33)","Karl D. Triebes - Chief Technical Officer & EVP-Product Development","No. We're offloading it from the CPUs, so we're not having to burn CPU cycles. So, you can do anything in software, but it's a question of performance. And by offloading certain functionality into the hardware of the system, we can really heavily optimize this. And by the way, this is \u2013 if you look at Intel's approach with their acquisition of Altera, they're taking the same approach where you can allow for optimization of hardware elements as well as software elements all on the same system. So...","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","So what you're really talking about is going back to what John said about running more modules on a given appliance...","Karl D. Triebes - Chief Technical Officer & EVP-Product Development","Yeah. So, more functionality, more modules, more consolidation, more performance. The systems will also have more memory, so we can support higher concurrency limits. There's a lot of goodness with that architecture.","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","So the TCO comes down to running more modules then?","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That, plus the other things we said.","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Vijay Bhagavath with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Hi, John and Andy. Question for you around your roadmap focus. I'd like to better understand the focus and emphasis of the roadmap. Is it on speeds and feeds like you just mentioned the 100-gig VIPRION blades or would it be in security, for example, some of the growth opportunities in security outbound firewalls end point security, threat analytics? I think where I'm coming from is I want to better understand over the next few years do you see F5 primarily as a security company, or do you see it primarily as an ADC company? Thanks.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Now, this is an easy question. So, first of all, by a mile the focus is on more sophistication and feature sets within the software. That's obviously the way things are going and especially by a long way security being the main focus for us. So, things like behavior analysis, areas like that where you'll see enhancing all our software capability. Our goal has always been to add features to increase our addressable market especially in security and that's what you're going to see.","Speeds and feeds are great because they tend to be pretty tactical from a growth perspective and we'll take advantage of that, but over time what we're interested in is building our security portfolio that's absolutely focused on our skill set which is application security and then increasing that. And increasing it not just by functionality, but also by the way we take it to market, like, for example, the Silverline services having our own cloud-based (31:10) And then, of course, putting that software on all the public clouds as well.","Karl D. Triebes - Chief Technical Officer & EVP-Product Development","And just to add to that, just giving an example performance and functionality are critical, because we use the Gi firewall, for example. We're able to get in \u2013 one of the reasons we're able to get in there is that we can replace racks of gear with a much smaller footprint with a much higher TCO and so performance has to be there, the functionality has to be there, but those two go hand in hand.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Perfect. A quick follow-on is on Europe and Asia. We have heard mixed signals from other companies that have reported. What are you seeing, John, in terms of a demand outlook in Europe and Asia? Thanks.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We're happy with it. I mean, I actually \u2013 it was quite specific that we actually saw year-over-year sales, bookings growth in APAC and in Japan and in EMEA. And we think we're actually doing really well there and we've got a good opportunity.","Vijay K. Bhagavath - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Just two quick questions. John, any further granularity on what exactly happened with the telco vertical? It looks like it was down probably in the mid-teens or so.","And then second question on product revenue growth. I know you talked about that. Should we be looking at product revenue growth in July and September on a sequential basis than on a year-over-year basis? Thanks.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On your first question, just for clarity, were you saying it was down 15% or \u2013 because it was 21% of our revenue for the quarter.","Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Right, John. Maybe my calculation might be a little bit off, but telco was down, I'm thinking, in sort of the mid-teens or somewhere around there.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. As I mentioned, telco \u2013 I mentioned the two verticals, telco and finance and I did say that telco was down more. We've seen this so many times and the really big one was, I don't even like mentioning it, but it was in 2013 in the same quarter where we saw telco slump pretty badly. There's definitely \u2013 I think it was a slow spending environment in telco last quarter. I think we've seen that from some of our peers and announcements that they've made. There also, I think, there's some slowness related to some of the decisions we're making from an NFV architecture perspective.","Having said all that, we look at the interest level on the 100-gig blade and it's very high. Now, we're not announcing it. We're not shipping it until May. We have taken fairly sizable order already, and we expect to make revenue this quarter. So, I think, to be frank, I think the biggest \u2013 the real run rate starts in Q4, but we will see additional revenue. And that, I think, will help certainly in the short-term and beginning of 2017 the telco vertical. But, apart from that, I don't think there's anything systemic. It's all about with us, typically, projects not closing or moving from one quarter to another.","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then to your question on product revenue growth, I mean, obviously, we don't guide beyond the current quarter, but you do see sequential growth implied in this coming quarter and that's our absolute focus and that's why we're spending a lot of time talking about the new products coming out and the impact we think that's going to have through the rest of the year and into 2017. So, we'll see.","Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer Securities. Your line is now open.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Couple of questions from me. First, following up on Sanjiv's question on the service provider. John, is there potential any (35:06) in front of your 100-gig introduction? And can you tell us if there's been some unusual turnover in your sales force in general and maybe in your service provider sales force more specifically?","And then, Andy, with regards to OpEx, I think, in your investor day last year, you've kind of talked about how you expect operating margins in the second half of the year to be better than the first half of the year. Clearly it's showing, but can you give us a little bit sense of a magnitude? How much of an improvement? Should we see a little bit more a flattish pattern from your R&D expenses, which have been moving up quite aggressively in the last three quarters? Does that flatten out here \u2013 how much of a lift we're getting operating margin-wise.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okey-dokey. I'll take the first two then. On the delay, I mean, it's always tough to tell that. There may be some proportion of delay that happened last quarter. Remember, we're spending a lot of time talking to the large customers, large service provider customers about the 100-gig. We've got a pretty good view into the potential demand both this quarter and next. As with any new product, they will try it out, which is why I was indicating that we'll probably see a stronger reception to it in Q4, because it's only going to be coming out in May, but we feel really, really positive about seeing revenues this current quarter as well.","So it's difficult to actually measure that type of question. I would probably say that, because it's going to be available this quarter, one cancels out the other. In other words, I don't think there's going to be any significant delay because of the 100-gig, just to be specific.","Regarding the turnover question, we don't really talk about that stuff much, but I will comment on it. We did see some turnover last quarter in the Americas. We're addressing that aggressively. In fact, we have addressed most of it aggressively, actually, to make sure that we don't lose any momentum because of that. But, I wouldn't go into it in any more detail than that.","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And on operating margin, the messaging we put out there still holds. And if you look at our revenue guidance against the OpEx and gross margin I put out there, we are going to see some improvement in operating margin. But like we always say, we're going to watch it against the revenue and adjust accordingly. So, we're looking forward to continued improvement against revenue growth. And if we see that, we'll have it; and if not, we'll adjust accordingly.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Very good. Good luck, guys.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. It seems like in the next couple quarters you've got a lot of new product launches and things like that, which is very exciting. Don't get me wrong. Can you help us understand about what we should be thinking about for OpEx as well as margins? I think you'd mentioned you're going to be hiring this quarter about, I think you said 50 additional employees, which is good. The cost profiles or the operating expenses and associated gross margins of, kind of, the run rate what we're doing now versus these newer products, so we don't get too ahead of ourselves and monitor in how they plan out with these next couple quarters of your new product launches. Thank you.","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, specifically on gross margins, where we think we could see potential upside, we don't think the new products coming out will have a lower gross margin profile. This is really about mix and mix-to-software, and the impact that could have on the longer term to our margin. And we'll see.","As we talk about quite a bit, if we do get gross margin improvement, we like to look at how we can invest that back in the business, and our most recent obvious example is bringing Silverline to market with really not (39:13) much of an impact on our overall business model. And though we don't guide much beyond the next quarter, where you see we said 84% for our non-GAAP gross margin, we expect to see strong gross margins continue, and we'll manage it very carefully.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much for the details.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Two quick questions, if I could. I just want to drill a little deeper in terms of the international strength, if you will, relative to the U.S. How much of that is related to market share gains versus just penetration of existing customers?","And then the other question we had, we've been doing some work and obviously have limits in terms of how many VARs we can speak with, but the VARs seem to feed back to us that hey, a lot of our customers don't recognize F5 as a security vendor. I was just kind of curious why you're not taking advantage of this opportunity with all these new products and maybe spend a little more from a sales evangelism perspective to get the word out that you're going to be a long-term security vendor?","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Let me take the second one first. I mean, we do \u2013 we couldn't deny that we could improve our security profile image, because we think we've already earned it, but clearly we haven't earned it from a marketing or a profile perspective, and we need to do that. So you'll see us doing a number of things. I mean, if you look at some of the hires that we're hiring, we're hiring more and more security people, and we've added significant security experts within the field to support the overall sales force. We've had it \u2013 I talked about Pete Brant with his background in security, our new CISO. So, you'll see us doing more than that.","I'm not going to say anything specific of that spend, but it's the big focus for us, because it's the future. We're also pushing ahead with the security research team as well, because we do need to get more public about that. I mean, in fact, if you looked on the script today, we probably never really mentioned some of the security wins we've had during the call we've started to do that as well. So, we do take that \u2013 we take that input very seriously.","In terms of the first question on outside of the Americas in terms of how's the growth profile, I'm not sure it's directed at market share gain and\/or customer penetration. I think, first of all, typically, when we penetrate, say, the times 200 that's a good thing, because that means we do more and more business. So, we love the concept of penetrating into existing customers. There's so many applications that we can sit in front of and optimize. I don't think it's really that.","I think they've been executing well in a tough environment, obviously, but they've been executing well in those environments. We think with the changes we've been making, that John DiLullo has been making in sales in the Americas, you're going to see similar execution coming in the future as well.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jayson Noland with Baird. Your line is now open.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you. John, I wanted to ask about the dedicated security products DDoS in June and SSL in July. I guess that's not a surprise since you guys have a lot of traction in those categories now, but is this just the beginning of a portfolio expansion in security?","And then, Andy, if you could talk to the sales overlay. Are these SEs working with account managers, or are you hiring dedicated account managers with security quota? Thanks.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Okay. On the first question, yeah, it's absolutely beginning and Karl can talk about this in a second. I would say, first of all, DDoS we feel really good about across the board, and you'll see us linking a standalone DDoS solution to a Silverline DDoS solution via signaling, which is going to be pretty unique and feel good about that. But, the reason I'm mentioning the first two is that we're hearing a lot of interest from the field on SSL Intercept and SSL Air Gap. So, yes, we will be adding more, but our main focus is going to be taking that opportunity. In terms of the types of things we're adding, the Shuttle series is obviously geared to that to that and Karl might want to comment, just in general.","Karl D. Triebes - Chief Technical Officer & EVP-Product Development","Yeah. I was going to comment. We're significantly enhancing our security portfolio. I mean, centralized management, we didn't talk about that, but with BIG-IQ 5.0 our whole security or portfolio is now managed under one central controller. We can manage multiple hundreds of devices, tens of thousands of objects, things like that. So we're really expanding that. And then with the appliances the SSL Intercept John mentioned, the same thing with the DDoS as well as Carrier-Grade Firewall and some other things that we're planning in the future. We're significantly enhancing the capabilities at DDoS solution in addition to that, doing things like behavioral DDoS, being able to fingerprint, identify bad actors.","We can leverage that for threat intelligence speeds, we have security analytics that we're building, and that'll be coming out as part of the solution. We've been significantly enhancing our identity and access management solution, which is our APM platform. We're adding some major new features in the next six months to that to enhance its federation and single sign-in capabilities. So there's just a lot going on on that portfolio that we just don't have time to talk about here at this venue. But there's a tremendous amount of focus from the teams on that.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Andy, the cost of the sales overlay? Like how expansive is the head count addition?","John DiLullo - Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales","This is John DiLullo. A lot of the investments that we've made in the awareness and training and making our sales team literate has been by investing in the team that we have onboard now. Over the past 18 months, we've also invested in a specialist organization that does sales and technical design, and that's the team we're running with at this point.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","John Eldridge - Director, Investor Relations","Hi. This is John Eldridge. I just want to say we'll take two more questions, and then we're going to wrap up this call.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Two questions. First, with respect to the outlook and some of the macro uncertainty you referenced, can you comment to what extent you've done anything different to be incrementally conservative in terms of developing your Q3 forecast, relative to what we've seen over the last few quarters?","And then for Andy, on the new buyback authorization, I was hoping to understand how aggressively you plan to be, and perhaps you can touch upon how you're thinking about M&A, and to what extent we should be expecting some activity during the second half of the year, as you look to bolster some of your security capabilities. Thanks.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the first question, I mean obviously, we're trying to be appropriately conservative, and I think we're managing that. Probably I'm going to take one thing that we're very aware of when we're looking at the forecast at the moment is the fact we've been through product transition, both good and bad. I mean 100-gig, we can see some upside, and we need to be careful about any (46:58) so we're taking a conservative view in that.","That's the main areas. And then, the real stuff, which is just crossing the Is and \u2013 sorry, dotting the Is and crossing the Ts in terms of the core business looking at forecast, making sure we do face-to-face QVRs, that type of thing. Excuse me.","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, on the buyback authorization, really that's the board teeing it up. We'll continue with our routine of every board meeting reviewing it. I think you've seen over the last couple of quarters it's actually gotten a bit more aggressive, just relative to share price being down and us setting up a 10b5-1 that has trigger points. Do I think we're going to get more aggressive? We'll have to see on that. That's a board decision, but we like the cadence that we're at right now.","As far as M&A goes, we continue to look, I would characterize it, pretty aggressively in the areas of security and telco for opportunities that we think fit, but we wouldn't comment much more than that.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Could you maybe just comment on deal size that you'd be looking at? Should we be expecting mostly smaller deals or would you be willing to go a little bit further out on the risk spectrum?","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think last quarter, we talked about widening the lens, which I think implies that we would look at bigger deals relative to maybe what you've seen us do. But again, it's going to be something that we look at very critically, because we understand the risk of that as well and we're going to look for those opportunities that are the right fit, both strategically and culturally that we think can really drive the company forward. So I'm very focused on that outcome.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","John Eldridge - Director, Investor Relations","Hello. Just one more question.","Operator","Yes. Our last question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Awesome. I want to thank you for calling me last, so I can ask multiple questions.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","(49:09)","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","On a serious note, John, Andy, can you \u2013 couple of things. One, can you offer us any color on the cloud wins? Obviously, there's been a lot of concern among the investment community about your position relative to the cloud, Amazon, in particular, but the cloud in general. You referenced \u2013 I believe you referenced two wins in your prepared remarks, any additional color? And around that, I recognize you've been rejiggering your portfolio to optimize your cloud offerings to streamline in to get the right price points. Can you update us on where you are, how much more you need to do to get to where you want and need to be?","And then a quick question for Andy. Andy, historically, in virtual editions, I think you referenced the fact that ESPs, you used to say they were 80% of the price point on hardware. I think more recently, you've referenced them as being comparable, but I think you've always said the net income impact was a wash. I'm hoping you could update us.","And one final question if I may; I know there are a number here. But John, on the linearity issue and your comments about enterprise demand, we had Ixia recently note that there was a \u2013 they saw a meaningful downtick in the month or March from a number of comm equipment suppliers. They didn't name them, obviously, but \u2013 and then in your comments, if I understood you correctly, the quarter started off slow coming out of last quarter, in January and February, and there was a pickup in March. And I'm just wondering if you could shed any more light in terms of the pattern as it speaks to forward business.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. On the linearity, there wasn't a massive change from the norm. But what we did see about that and I commented on was that we felt better about the visibility in March. In other words, by visibility what I'm talking about is we look at \u2013 we're looking at the pipeline and mainly the forecasted deals for that quarter and the visibility of that improved quite radically over the previous two quarters, we felt.","That's a combination, probably of macro, but also of good sales management, to make sure that we know what's going on, and that's important to us. So I wouldn't put too much on the linearity thing, because it wasn't widely different from what we'd expect. It was a little bit soft in January\/February, and we were a bit worried about the visibility. In other words, we felt we'd do a lot better and we didn't. We thought we'd do a lot better and we didn't, but we came to March and we felt that visibility was excellent.","So that's \u2013 I'm trying to think \u2013 yeah, on the AWS and the cloud and that question, I mean I realize there's a lot of concern and we discussed this stuff a lot internally. But when we look at the installed base and the customers and the opportunities, we see a lot with things like our WAF product, our APM product. I actually gave three examples, in fact, of that type of thing. So there are definitely opportunities there as well.","But we've seen new business opportunities, where fairly big companies where we had no presence and we managed to get into that company via AWS marketplace, interestingly enough. And obviously, we feel good about the whole hybrid side of things, especially we're going to be more and more focused on orchestration and areas like that.","Having said all that, I do still think that it's been causing delay in spending overall. We also see some partnership opportunities with companies like Microsoft and Amazon on AWS, in terms of working with them on enterprise customers. And we had one very good example of that, that I mentioned, the banking company. Well, that was an example of a partnership.","Yeah. So I think it's early days. I mean it's not that we \u2013 we don't look at the pipeline right now and say, oh, my God, this is shrinking because of Amazon. We don't see that or because of the public cloud. There's no doubt in my mind, we probably don't get some business we would've got before, of a start-up company that was slated to the public cloud, and maybe just instead of buying equipment, just rent some software. That software could well be ours, but it's not critical yet. The major concern it gives us right now is, is it causing delays and then, from an opportunity perspective, how can we maximize our product on those public clouds and by partnering with the cloud vendors?","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And then, Paul, you were asking about the virtual editions on the pricing. And essentially, at our entry-level hardware systems, you do see parity on the gross margin dollar still. So it's not quite the same price-wise, but it's equivalent on the gross margin dollars.","And we're still seeing that the deal sizes aren't necessarily smaller, because usually, when they're buying virtual editions, they're deploying them on a more horizontal type of architecture, and so, they need more versions of it. So we're still in that kind of position.","Some of the things I'd highlight though was we're looking at new licensing models, specifically for the cloud. So bring your own license, where you can take the VE and move it as you want to. Enterprise license agreements, if they want a license in large scale, we'll do an enterprise license agreement. And I think where we're coming out with a 40 gig VE in an NFV environment, you may see that as well, where we do a lot of larger enterprise-type license agreements, and then, we'll see how that works out at discounting.","And then, we do offer, on a utility basis, on AWS, the ability to pull out your credit card and license our virtual editions. So we'll continue to be looking at those business models, to evolve them to the needs of our customers.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Andy, do you have a number for what virtual edition was as a percentage of revenue?","Andrew Reinland - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","John, in his comments, said overall software is more of a third of our sales, but we don't get much more detail than that.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","John McAdam - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thank you.","John Eldridge - Director, Investor Relations","Okay. Thank you, Sam, and thank you, all for joining us for this call.

More information on the meeting, including a link to where you can register for the event is available on our Investor Relations webpage.","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, Jason. Fiscal Q1 was a quarter of disciplined execution. We delivered Q1 \u201818 revenue and non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of the ranges we provided in October and executed another quarter of strong gross margin and cash flow. We continue to see strength in our software offerings, particularly deployments in the public cloud and our services business delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth.","First quarter revenue of $523 million, up 1% year-over-year was above the midpoint of our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. Driven by the recent U.S. Tax Reform Legislation, GAAP EPS of $1.41 per share was below our guidance of $1.47 per share to $1.50 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.26 per share was above our guidance of $2.02 per share to $2.05 per share. I will discuss the impact of the tax law changes in more detail later in my comments.","Product revenue of $227 million in the first quarter was down 5% year-over-year and accounted for 43% of total revenue. Services revenue of $296 million, grew 7% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue.","On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 2% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 27% of overall revenue. APAC, which accounted for 14% of the total, decreased 5% year-over-year and Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 12% from a year ago.","Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 16%, including 8% from U.S. Federal. In Q1, we had five greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15% of total revenue, Tech Data accounted for 12%, Arrow and Cynics each accounted for 11%, and Westcon accounted for 10% of revenue.","Moving on to our operating results, GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83.3%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.7%. GAAP operating expenses of $294 million were within our $288 million to $298 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $258 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 27.1% and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.5%.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.7%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.6%. GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were impacted by the recently-enacted Tax Reform Legislation.","Our GAAP effective tax rate of 38.7% was primarily impacted by two large non-recurring items; an estimated $7 million tax related to deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign tax earnings, and a $11.6 million impact from the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets due to the change in the U.S. tax rate. Our non-GAAP tax rate of 24.6% reflects the benefits from the reduction of the U.S. tax rate.","Turning to the balance sheet, in Q1 we generated $190 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.35 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 50 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.5 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $29 million. Deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $991 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately 4,375 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 1.24 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $120.73 per share for a total of $150 million.","Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q2, we continue to see enterprises and service providers adopt our software and security offerings as core components of the next-generation application architectures.","While this trend has lengthened sales cycles for hardware-based solutions with some organization in the middle of this transition, it is driving substantial growth opportunity in both private and public cloud deployments, providing a solid foundation for improving product revenue as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year and beyond.","With this in mind for the second quarter of fiscal year \u201818, we are targeting revenue in a range of $525 million to $535 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%.","We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $296 million to $306 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 26% for the second quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 25%.","We anticipate tax rates to remain at or around these levels for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and will continue to update on a quarterly basis and while we are not yet providing tax rate guidance for fiscal year \u201819, it is worth noting that we would expect another small step down in both our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in fiscal year \u201819 and beyond, reflecting full calendar year impact from the new tax legislation.","Our Q2 GAAP earnings target is $1.66 per share to $1.69 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.24 per share to $2.27 per share. As a reminder, we will be hosting our Investor and Analyst Meeting in New York on March 8.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Fran\u00e7ois.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. During the first quarter, we saw continued momentum with our virtual additions and another strong quarter from our services business. We are increasingly seeing security lead the conversation in new opportunities with customers and our cloud activity is growing as more customers look to our solutions for help in deploying applications across multi-cloud environments.","Earlier this month, we released our annual State of Application Delivery report. With over 3000 respondents, the report provides a comprehensive view into the application trends impacting enterprises, service providers and government organizations across the globe. The results show digital transformation is at the forefront of our customers\u2019 minds as they look to optimize their IT infrastructure and evolve how they develop and deliver applications.","Multi-cloud architectures are taking on growing relevance as most organizations pursue a best-of-breed strategy for each application deployment. Nearly nine in 10 respondents reported using multiple clouds with over half saying cloud decisions are made on a per application basis.","Our customers are increasingly looking to automation and orchestration to realize leaner IT with the goal of reducing OpEx and better scaling applications to meet user demand. Trends around supporting multi-cloud deployments and the growing importance of automation align with areas where we have increased our development investment over the past year.","During the first quarter, we introduced per application VE offerings supporting traffic management and web application firewall services, and we made platform enhancements that reduced the boot time and footprint of our software by 50% for public cloud deployments.","These offerings are building blocks for enhanced central management and automation capabilities we will introduce later this year that support elastic provisioning of VE capacity. Executing in these areas will extend the number of applications we can address, whether these applications reside on-prem or in the cloud.","Taking a closer look at first quarter results, revenue was above the midpoint of our guided range with strength in our software offerings. We saw a rebound in our EMEA theater as initiatives we undertook in 2017 to improve execution in this region are paying dividends. We continued to deliver strong profitability and cash generation even as we accelerate our development and go-to-market investment in software, public cloud and security.","We are not satisfied with the current level of product revenue growth, but we are encouraged by improvements in execution and the continued strength in the fastest growing areas of the business.","And while we have seen instances of longer sign-off periods for hardware-related sales within some organizations, our overall appliance revenue was in line with our expectations entering the first quarter. We continue to expect the iSeries platform will be a growing part of our appliance mix in the coming quarters.","We believe these product family offers compelling performance and customization advantages versus competing offerings, and will enable us to take market share in the appliance segment as we progress through fiscal 2018.","iSeries provides advantages and key use cases for customers including efficiently managing encrypted traffic and scaling to support high transactional applications such as IoT. We have several significant customer wins in the quarter driven by the SSL capabilities enabled by iSeries.","These include seven figure deals with the government organization and a large financial services organization where our ability to efficiently inspect and re-encrypt SSL traffic was a clear differentiator overcome competing offerings.","A large pan-European managed service provider will utilize our hardware, security and IoT protocol capabilities to support the need for securely scaling applications to better manage customer premise equipment and data.","These include inspecting SSL traffic, providing DDoS protection, load balancing and authentication of IoT traffic. F5\u2019s ability to innovate around scaling to support bi-directional communication in an IoT environment was a key contributor to this win.","During the first quarter, our VE sales grew over 25% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Driving this growth was increased activity within the public cloud from both bring your own license and utility offerings.","We are present within all three major public clouds in providing advanced application services and security across multi-cloud deployments is becoming a priority to customers as they move forward with their digital transformation efforts.","We accelerate growth within the public cloud. We continue to deepen our partner relationships. In December, we earned Amazon Web Services networking competency designation by showcasing our ability to ensure performance, availability and security for business critical applications hosted within AWS. This follows our security competency recognition by AWS in October.","We joined a select group of partners to meet the qualifications set forth by AWS for technical proficiency and customer success in multiple competencies. As we look to extend our solutions to a broader set of our customer\u2019s applications, we are focused on creating more flexibility in deployment and consumption.","Over the past six months, we launched our subscription offerings on large scale and launched enterprise license agreements. Initial customer response for these consumption models has been very positive, with a building pipeline, including net new opportunities across on-prem and cloud environments.","Our enterprise security momentum remains strong in the first quarter driven by our WAF and identity access offerings. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customer\u2019s growing needs around Application Security.","Our F5 core is a non-matched level of application fluency with large complex applications. Our security capabilities are increasingly leading the way in opening new opportunities across our customer base.","We continue to expand our application security portfolio across private and public cloud environments. Building on our market leading position in WAF, we are partnering with AWS to make our WAF security rules available to our common customers through the AWS marketplace.","Today, we announced several new additions to the senior management team. We are excited to welcome Ana, Kara, Ram and Tom to the F5 team. These additions put into action the plans from the business review process we undertook last year and discussed on our Q4 earnings call.","Focus on clearly aligning our product roadmap with customer needs through ADC and security business leadership is a key priority that Kara and Ram will drive. Tom will be responsible for driving the business long-term strategy, as well as overseeing corporate development and our incubation areas, which we will discuss in more detail in March.","We are pleased with our execution in the first quarter and we are well-positioned to evolve with our customers as they make their digital transformations. To better reach the next tier of applications in the enterprise, we are reducing frictions associated with purchasing, deploying and managing our solutions.","We are excited by our growing traction within the public cloud and the role our application security solutions are playing across our customer base. Driving improved product revenue growth remains our top priority and we expect to show progress on this front as we move through fiscal 2018.","In closing, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the first quarter.","With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks. First one, Andy, from a, I guess, two perspectives, one from a macro in the health and in-demand perspective where it looks like the objective numbers relative to U.S. growth, EU growth, et cetera, have been trending up and [indiscernible] right now to be quite favorable.","Andy Reinland","Yeah.","Paul Silverstein","And so there\u2019s a favorable economic backdrop. And then, in terms of the company specific issues or product market specific issues, especially relative to the product refresh from a year ago that hadn\u2019t transpired and we still don\u2019t see the product revenue growth picking up, the question being, can you give us more insight, more detail on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of customer behavior, their willingness to spend, as well as your particular issues in the ADC market?","Andy Reinland","Thank you, Paul. So, I\u2019ll start, on your first question as it relates to Europe. I think you heard that we had some challenges in Europe in 2017, which we felt were linked both to some macro issues around the environment, Brexit, some uncertainty around regulation, and we also felt that some of it had to do with our own organization and some execution challenges we were having.","Over the last, I\u2019d say, two quarters, we felt the number of these have gotten -- have moved in the right direction, so a lot of the macro uncertainties in Europe I think are resolved. There\u2019s more clarity around Brexit, generally the European economies in Continental Europe are doing much better.","And so we feel that the macro environment is generally better, and we\u2019ve made some changes in our own formation in Europe. We\u2019ve made some leadership changes. We\u2019ve also realigned our teams towards what we perceive to be the best opportunities for growth. And as a result, we\u2019re doing better. We are really encouraged by the results we saw in Europe this quarter. We\u2019re cautious because we had several quarters of challenges there, but we\u2019re also optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing with our pipeline generally in Europe and our execution.","Your second question was on product revenue growth; and generally, the customer behaviors that we\u2019re seeing. There hasn\u2019t been much change on that front since last quarter that -- we\u2019re seeing two things specifically on the iSeries refresh.","Number one, the adoption of the product continues to be very strong. It is a very high-quality product. Our customers really see actually new use cases for the product and really love the performance of the product, so we\u2019re continuing to see strong adoption within our customer base for the platform.","On the other hand, we\u2019re also continuing to see some delays in decision-making related to hardware, in part because of the complexity of the architectures that our customers are dealing with now.","As they move applications across multiple clouds, some in hybrid cloud, some in private cloud, some in public cloud, the variables in the decision-making process are just more complex and we\u2019re seeing elongated cycles of decision-making and that\u2019s one of the reasons. I think the key reason, why we don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the growth acceleration that we would have expected at this point in past cycles.","Paul Silverstein","And Fran\u00e7ois, just a quick clarification, if I may, on your commentary about seeing strength in public cloud with respect to enterprises adopting multi-cloud architecture, I know you don\u2019t quantify it, but I am asking you if you would be willing to quantify it for the benefit of all of us, I think it\u2019s awfully important?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yeah. So we don\u2019t quantify it, Paul. I think we\u2019ve said it is growing fast. These numbers are still small relative to our overall revenues. They\u2019re growing very fast, and we\u2019ve actually exceeded our own expectations again this quarter in terms of the growth we\u2019re seeing in our solutions in the public cloud. We\u2019ll probably say more about -- overall our public cloud strategy, the solutions we have in there, and the traction we\u2019re seeing in the public cloud at our Analyst Meeting in March, Paul.","Paul Silverstein","And you don\u2019t believe there\u2019s any cannibalization or meaningful cannibalization?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Actually I do think so, you have to part that into two domains. There are some applications that are -- that we support that are moving to the public cloud and generally we have a very strong attach rate to these applications. But I think in these use cases, it is substitutive to something we would have done on-prem in the past, so that -- there\u2019s definitely an element of cannibalization or if you will, just a change in deployment model of on-prem versus public cloud.","But we\u2019re also seeing net new use cases, so we do acquire and we did again this quarter acquired a number of net new logos, so these are companies that have never bought from F5 before and bought for the first time in our public cloud partners AWS, Azure, or Google.","And we\u2019re also seeing some types of deployments that we would have not had access to before. So a number of our deployments in the public cloud are utility based. This is where customers are essentially renting F5 Virtual Editions for hours, and we\u2019re already billing several millions of hours of Virtual Edition in public cloud today, and that\u2019s net new incremental for us. That\u2019s not opportunities we would have had access to before.","Paul Silverstein","I appreciate. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Long of BMO. Your line is open.","Tim Long","Thank you. Just two for me as well, if you talk about, a little bit about the service line, it was very strong again, a little stronger than expected here, was there any kind of one timers or anything abnormal with seeing the growth reaccelerate there? And then on the telco vertical, a little bit less than normal seasonal in Q4. Could you point a little bit to what might have held that business back and talk a little bit about the outlook for the telco piece looking out the next few quarters? Thank you.","Andy Reinland","Yeah. Tim, so I\u2019ll start with the service line and I think a couple of things is when we tend to see seasonally just based on calendar end contracts align and things like that and that helps drive business. We also had a program in place for really focusing on going after business in Europe that we felt we weren\u2019t focused on enough and actually had a pretty effective quarter in recapturing a lot of maintenance contracts that for lack of a better description slipped through the cracks. So those one-time things helped drive the strength that we saw. So we\u2019ll see that pullback a little bit in Q2 along with normal seasonality but that\u2019s built into the guidance.","John DiLullo","Yeah. This is John DiLullo. Also I can answer the question about the carriers. We saw as per normal a little bit of lumpiness last quarter and it didn\u2019t come exactly where we\u2019d expected. But aren\u2019t reading anything long-term into that and continue to see a lot of activity in both the software and the hardware environments in that vertical.","Tim Long","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Mark Kelleher","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to go back to the product revenue. I want to probably stick on that a little bit here. The last three quarters we\u2019ve seen continued deceleration and in this quarter despite the iSeries kicking into its cycle and strong Europe, we\u2019re seeing that deceleration again. So what are the headwinds that you\u2019ve been facing that are -- that you see going away that will allow that topline to grow into next year -- this year?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Mark. So I think actually from an iSeries refresh perspective, we don\u2019t see a change. We think the demand for the product is very healthy. As I\u2019ve said we\u2019re seeing new use cases for the product in IoT, high transactional applications, et cetera, and we think that\u2019s going to continue for the longer term.","There are though some product drivers of product revenue growth that we think are kicking in and probably will accelerate in the second half of the year. Virtual editions will continue to grow. We expect our public cloud revenues to continue to grow.","We continue to see strong demand for our security solutions, in particular driven by WAF and the increasing trend towards to encryption of all traffic that we deal with. And our SSL capabilities position very well -- position us very well to deal with that. So security, Virtual Editions and public cloud, I think will continue to be a driver in the second half of the year.","And then there\u2019s some changes we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ve talked about our realignment during our earnings call three months ago. There\u2019s some changes we\u2019ve made structurally in our sales channels, go-to-market and some consumption models that we have started offering that we expect to have also an impact going into the rest of FY18. So when you factor all of that, I think we feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve said last quarter, which is continued improvement in product revenue performance throughout the year.","Mark Kelleher","Okay. Just as a quick follow up, the -- Europe was very strong but the U.S., the Americas was kind of weak, was there anything particular going on in the U.S.?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","No. Nothing -- I would say nothing in particular. I think the demand in service providers in the U.S. was, it\u2019s typically lumpy but it was weak this quarter. So you factor all that in, it made up for I\u2019d say a decent performance in North America but not particularly strong. I\u2019d say North America enterprise was stronger than North America service provider.","Mark Kelleher","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","The next -- I am sorry, the next question is from James Fish of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","James Fish","Hi guys. Thanks for the question here. Not to keep beating a dead horse but with product down 5% and it looks like actually on a billings basis you guys were down as well for the first time in a little while. At what point do you guys think that as we progress through the year that we could see stability in the product line, if at all and potentially what concerns you on sort of services billings potentially being down then on a year-to-year basis?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","So I\u2019ll take your question on the product and Andy will touch on the services, James. So you know, on the product first, this was an execution quarter for us. The product revenue came roughly in line with where we expected it to be.","As you know, we don\u2019t guide product revenue specifically for the other quarters, but the drivers that I\u2019ve just gone through around software, security and cloud, as well as the initiatives we undertook both on the product and the sale side give us good visibility into where we think we\u2019re going to be going into FY18.","And we expect our product revenue performance to improve sequentially from what we had in Q1 throughout the rest of FY18. I think that\u2019s what we said three months ago and we still feel pretty good about that.","Andy Reinland","Yeah. And then on the services business, yeah, that -- because most of our services business and revenue is driven by maintenance and renewals, and given where our product revenue has been over the last year and a half, many times we talked about we\u2019re going to see that pull down our services billings overtime, and therefore, the revenue. We think returning to product revenue growth will then pull that back up.","So year-over-year we are seeing it pull down a little bit on a percentage basis, it was expected, it\u2019s directly correlated to our products business. That\u2019s just how it is and as Fran\u00e7ois said, as we expect to see that improve as we execute through the year, we\u2019d expect that to see services pull from that as we return to product revenue growth.","James Fish","Got it. And then just a quick clarification, I am not sure if I\u2019ve missed it, but did you guys mention what the average deal size was this quarter, I think last quarter it was about $122,000.","Andy Reinland","Yeah.","James Fish","And then, Andy, any color as to any change in the renewal rates?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So to the average deal size, this quarter it was about $113,000, so still within that kind of band that we see. We think a little bit of that\u2019s seasonality, if you look a year ago Q1, it was $110,000. We\u2019re not seeing any dynamic in the deals combined with that that would lead us to any other conclusion that we\u2019re still in that band and we don\u2019t think it\u2019s pulling up or down deals. And as far as renewal rates, we saw that tick up because of the cleanup in EMEA, but overall I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty normal.","James Fish","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura | Instinet. Your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal","Thanks very much. I\u2019d like to change the subject a little bit and get to tax. Part of that, Andy, is for you in terms of what can you tell us about how we should be thinking about the benefits to your free cash flow from the tax reform? And then, Fran\u00e7ois, for you to some extent this gives you an even more powerful balance sheet to work with, what are the triggers that you might consider to deploy that? Thank you.","Andy Reinland","Yeah. So what we expect is we will see -- as we see the benefit of that through the year, the majority of it we think is going to fall through and now it\u2019s still early days. We\u2019re evaluating it against our strategy. But and we\u2019ll talk more about this at AM. But there\u2019s a reality to how we view our business and where -- how we value our business model, and we\u2019re going to take all of that into consideration, and we think by March 8 we\u2019ll be able to talk in more detail about what we\u2019re going to do with that free cash flow. But again, as I started out, we\u2019ll see a lot of that flow through, but reluctant to give anything more specific than that right now.","Jeff Kvaal","I can tell. Yeah.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","And Jeff, on your -- to the second part of your question, so we will talk more about capital allocation at our Analyst Meeting in March, but I would say this, generally, access to capital has not impacted our capital allocation strategies historically and I don\u2019t expect this tax rate to fundamentally impact our capital allocation strategy.","And it has been and our view will continue to be that we want to return a fair amount of capital to shareholders and that\u2019s been our practice. I think we have one of the strongest buybacks in the industry. But we\u2019ve also said that when we have opportunities for M&A, we will be disciplined about these opportunities, but if we see opportunities to accelerate things that are strategic to us, we will do that. And that philosophy is not fundamentally changed by the benefit we\u2019re getting from the change in Tax Legislation.","Jeff Kvaal","Okay. Thank you both.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","The next questioner is from Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Your line is open.","Alex Henderson","Thanks. Two quick questions, one, just looking at the March quarter guide on the revenues, is it reasonable to think that the rate of decline in products has hit the trough in the December quarter is down 5% or is it possible that we could see a similar decline or more in the March quarter given it\u2019s against a tougher comp?","And then the second question I had was really on the security side. I was wondering if you could give us some sense of, is WAF the vast majority of what you\u2019re selling in security and if so, it looks like that\u2019s becoming more and more of a feature on most of the security platforms that are out there. Has competition increased and made it more difficult in that space as a result of that becoming a more widely distributed feature on more and more platforms? Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Alex. I\u2019ll take the first one. John will take security. So, yes, I mean, if you look at our guidance for the March quarter and you -- I think you do a good analysis on the midpoint of the guide, et cetera.","Yes, it would imply that we have -- that the product revenue performance in Q2 will be better than what it was in Q1. And in fact, generally, when we look at our -- at the progress we have, the pipeline we see in our product revenue and the execution we see, we actually do feel we are turning the corner on product revenue growth in Q2, and frankly, we would be disappointed if we did not return to product revenue growth in the second half of \u201818.","Alex Henderson","How much is your comps there?","John DiLullo","Answering -- Alex, answering your question on WAF. So this is a really a great market for us and as you know, we have a leading product there. We have also a very differentiated product especially in our installed base, which is still a very large market for us to go after.","And then, as it relates to greenfield opportunities with competition, I think we have some competitive differentiators, but we also have a lot of mobility and our product works in a multi-cloud environment and all the public clouds as well, and that\u2019s one of the fastest areas of growth for us, people trying to standardize their security posture across the multi-cloud environment. So it\u2019s mostly been a positive for us.","Alex Henderson","So you haven\u2019t seen any erosion in that market or any increased pressures in it as a result of additional competition?","John DiLullo","No. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a greatly increased demand and some of our competitors are raising awareness and that\u2019s generally been a positive.","Alex Henderson","Thanks for the explanation.","Operator","The next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","James Faucette","Hi. Good afternoon. A couple of questions for me, first, just wondering with the kind of bringing some of the customers through service and maintenance contracts that expired back into the fold, if you will on those. I am wondering if we should think about that potentially hurting the chances that they will upgrade to the newest versions of product or does that help, just trying to think about like how that may impact it?","And I guess as part of the improvement in Europe, any evidence from your perspective that the weakening dollar may have helped a little bit either in terms of accelerating close times or expanding product or deal size, excuse me?","And then, I guess my last question is, Fran\u00e7ois for -- with the appointing of Ram to be Director of Security, can you talk a little bit about how you would like to have kind of what his to do list is and what impact you\u2019d like to see him have on security and tied to the existing F5 product portfolio, and over what timeframe we should expect that? Thanks a lot.","John DiLullo","Thank you, James. That\u2019s a lot in there. Which is the first question again?","Andy Reinland","Well, I\u2019ll start with the first one on the service and maintenance. Do we think that hinders customers upgrading and John can add on to this if he has additional commentary from his perspective, but really this was a program put in place, because we think we lost a little focus there. This wasn\u2019t anything more than smaller deals were just not getting addressed. We regrouped the team and where they thought they were lost we said they\u2019re not lost, go after them, and get renewals.","And when we renew, we can capture the revenue for the period of time that\u2019s gone by between the expiration of the contract and the renewal and we think that was the main driver there, not anything that you could correlate that that\u2019s directionally how they might be thinking about upgrading their equipment.","John DiLullo","But I would add to that that it\u2019s very powerful from a sales go-to-market perspective to continue to have that commercial relationship with those customers. It doesn\u2019t inhibit future sales. In fact, it gives us lots of visibility in the challenges our customers are having and really sets up the next generation sales, so it\u2019s hugely positive to have a high renewal rate for us.","Andy Reinland","Yeah. And then on the foreign currency, could that be helping us, I mean, clearly because we bill internationally primarily in U.S. dollars, it makes our equipment more affordable. Anecdotally, I am not hearing anything that would say that\u2019s driving business. I would contend this really is more about projects that were delayed as they worked their way through everything going on from Brexit to GDPR and it\u2019s getting to the point where it\u2019s freeing up again. So I wouldn\u2019t correlate those two things personally.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","And then to the second part of your question, James, so Ram and his priorities. Firstly, on his background, RAM has a long experience in the security industry, both with more traditional security companies and more sort of next-generation cloud-oriented security companies.","And so he has a very broad perspective of the industry and that is going to be very valuable for us, because in security we have no shortage of opportunities, and a key part of the mission for Ram is to really prioritize the opportunities that we go after.","One of the immediate elements of what Ram is working on is we have been quite successful selling security attached to our ADC and we see opportunity more and more, and demand from our customers to take on some of our standalone security offerings that would appeal more to a sec ops buyer. And so Ram\u2019s looking at what\u2019s the best way to capture that opportunity and which offerings should be first versus offerings that would follow on later, and that\u2019s an immediate priority.","And then more broadly, in the space of application security, we\u2019re seeing a lot of new complexities emerge. Those were validated again by the research we did in our State of Application Delivery report, where we\u2019re seeing that, as people adopt more and more multi-cloud environments, their confidence in security solutions is actually decreasing.","And really, there\u2019s an opportunity to emerge as a partner to solve these new complexities. Where we start in this journey to multi-cloud application security, again is a set of priorities and investments that RAM is going to define for us.","James Faucette","That\u2019s great. Thank you so much.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, James.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Genovese of MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Michael Genovese","Thanks a lot. Can you help us quantify some of these things in your security, for instance, security appliance attach rates? Do you have any kind of metric we can track there and even more importantly, standalone security sales as a percentage of revenue, and are we targeting that to grow over time, what can you share with us there? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Mike. And so the last question is easy. Yes, we are targeting standalone security offerings to grow over time. To the first part, no we don\u2019t break that out. I can tell you an important portion of our security or even of our ADC business is driven by security and I would say qualitatively that that portion of the business that\u2019s driven by security is growing every quarter.","The other data point I\u2019d give you is that, as our public cloud business grows, the security attach rate in the public cloud is about double what it is on-prem and that\u2019s because of the complexities of securing applications in the public cloud. So that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll go as far as quantifying our security business, generally the trends are up and more important for us.","Michael Genovese","Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thanks, Fran\u00e7ois. And then you just hired a new Strategy Corporate Development Manager and so my question is how do you think he and his team can help you drive the topline growth in the company and do you think security will kind of be over weighted portion of that?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes, Mike. So there are multiple responsibilities for Tom Fountain who\u2019s joined us last week as our Chief Strategy Officer. One is we have initiated a number of incubation initiatives where we\u2019re looking at new developments that would have potentially long-term growth opportunities for F5 and these are under Tom in part, because Tom has also a background in venture capital and can help us provide the right oversight for this part of the business.","Tom also owns our Business Development Group and our relationships with a number of companies with whom we have partnerships in the IT space. And these partnerships are actually quite important for the topline, because we co-market, we co-sale, we do certifications, we are integrated in their environments, whether it be SDN environments or next-generation IT architectures. And so those partnerships are key to short-term revenues and Tom\u2019s going to help drive that with the Business Development Group.","Then the last portion of Tom\u2019s responsibilities is in fact corporate development and in that Tom has the experience to help us with the build versus buy decisions that we think we will be making as we assess opportunities in security and elsewhere around developing our portfolio.","Michael Genovese","Okay. Thank you, Fran\u00e7ois.","Jason Willey","Operator, I think, we\u2019ll take one more question.","Operator","Certainly. The next question is from Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland","Okay. Great. Thank you. Fran\u00e7ois, I wanted to ask about your comment on architectural change causing decision-making delays. Public cloud isn\u2019t new and SaaS isn\u2019t new, so maybe there\u2019s an inflection point that\u2019s happened of late, but could you talk to that statement a little more?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes. So what we\u2019ve seen is a number of customers are when they\u2019re making decisions and this comment was specific to the refresh cycle on iSeries, and specifically, on hardware purchases, where we\u2019re seeing a number of customers before making these decisions as part of the decision-making cycle undertake a review of what assets do they want to have where.","You will see that one thing that has changed year-on-year and we\u2019ve reported on that in this State of Application Delivery report, is that customers are embracing multi-cloud and as part of that they\u2019re having a sort of best cloud for the app strategy. So they\u2019re making decisions on where an app is going to reside on a per app basis in cloud versus non-cloud.","And as they go and make these decisions and have to make significant commitment on infrastructure assets, that decision-making cycle is elongated. Cloud is not new. You\u2019re correct about that. But I think multi-cloud and per app decision-making around multi-cloud is a trend that we are seeing becoming reality.","For us, frankly, while this has given I would say short term headwinds specifically on hardware and as we said, I think, last quarter, we didn\u2019t see on hardware the uptick that we would have seen at this part of the cycle.","Overall, we think over the long run it bodes very well for us, because we feel that we\u2019re probably uniquely positioned to serve these needs across multi-cloud environments with our hardware, on-premises, our software on-premise and increasingly our software in the public cloud with multiple consumption models across all these environments. There aren\u2019t -- there isn\u2019t any other company that really has this breadth of offerings for supporting these multi-cloud strategies.","Jayson Noland","Okay. And then to finish things up you\u2019ve called your growth areas cloud, security and then Virtual Editions. Is -- which of those is receiving the most investment or which offer has the most opportunity across those three?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","So that\u2019s a good question. So there are different stages of growth. I would say our Virtual Edition software is already a meaningful business for F5 and we continue to shift more investments in that direction.","Security also I think is at scale for us at F5. Public cloud is more nascent. So in terms of growth in investment, public cloud probably has the highest growth of investments in these areas, but the two other areas are if you will larger to-date and with increasing investments year-on-year.","Jayson Noland","Okay. Thanks a lot, Fran\u00e7ois.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you.","Andy Reinland","Thank you everyone for participating today. We hope that we see many of you in New York in March. Good afternoon.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

These forward-looking statements involve certain uncertainties and risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in our quarterly release, described in detail on our SEC filings.","Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we continued to see solid returns on the investments we made last year. The growing demand for our new hardware and software products, positive response to our recently introduced Synthesis architectural vision and our new pricing models, all led to above-expected sales in each of our major geographies.","Revenue of $406.5 million was above our guided range of $390 million to $400 million, an increase of 3% from the prior quarter and 11% year-over-year. GAAP EPS of $0.87 per share was above our $0.81 to $0.84 guidance. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.22 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.17 to $1.20 per share.","Product revenue of $218.6 million grew 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, representing 54% of total revenue. Service revenue of $187.9 million also grew 3% sequentially, 17% year-over-year, and accounted for 46% of total revenue. Accounting for 56% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2013. EMEA, which represented 24% of revenue, grew 17% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 15% of revenue and grew 19% year-over-year and Japan revenue, which grew 17% from a year ago, was 5% of total revenue for the quarter.","Enterprise customers represented 61% of sales during that quarter. Service providers accounted for 24% and government sales were 14%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.","In Q1, we have 3 greater than 10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which represented 17.9% of total revenue; Avnet, which accounted for 14.3%; and Westcon, which accounted for 13.5%.","Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.1%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.4%. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined sequentially, a result of lower service gross margin, which reflects our increased investment in consulting, while our non-GAAP product margin remained essentially flat with Q4.","GAAP operating expenses of $224.4 million were within our target range of $219 million to $226 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $193.4 million. GAAP operating margin was 26.9%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.9%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 37.8% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.1%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $158.9 million. In Q1, we repurchased slightly more than 2.4 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $82.35 for a total of $200 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately $1.24 billion in cash and investments. With the addition of $500 million authorized by the board for stock buyback at our most recent board meeting, approximately $781 million remains authorized under our share repurchase program.","DSO at the end of Q1 was 49 days. Inventories were $19.1 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5 million. Deferred revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $567.7 million. We ended the quarter with 3,520 employees, an increase of 165 from the prior quarter.","Based on growing demand for the new products we released in fiscal year '13, the strength of our security offerings, solid momentum with our Traffix Diameter solutions and positive customer response to our Synthesis architectural vision, we feel very confident about our ability to continue to grow the top line and anticipate continued sequential growth through the remainder of the fiscal year.","For the second quarter of fiscal 2014, our revenue target is $408 million to $418 million. We expect Q2 GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins to be consistent with Q1. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% range, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 83.5%.","We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $226 million to $233 million. This includes approximately $31.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.4 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","For Q2, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 38% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.87 to $0.90 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.23 to $1.26 per share.","We plan to increase our headcount by over 100 employees in the current quarter. We estimate DSO will be in the high 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $20 million to $22 million. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $80 million, reflecting the large sequential increase in our federal tax payments that we normally incur in our fiscal second quarter.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our performance in Q1. The improved product revenue growth that we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2013 gained more momentum in our first quarter of fiscal year 2014. All our major regions met or exceeded their sales internal forecast.","From a sales perspective, the star of the quarter was the EMEA region where we saw strong sales growth across most of the region. The Americas region had another strong quarter and a majority of territories in our Asia Pacific Japan region also delivered solid results.","Once again, our Services business produced excellent results, including a significant increase in deferred revenue, which grew approximately 7% sequentially over the last quarter and is now over $550 million.","I was very pleased with the sales momentum we are seeing as a result of the extensive product refresh we introduced during fiscal 2013. The new product line already accounts for the majority of our ADC sales and have equipped our salesforce and partner channel with the most functional and competitive ADC solutions in the market. These new products, combined with our new pricing and software tiering strategy, good-better-best, are proving to be very popular with our customer base and very competitive in new business opportunities.","It is early days with the good-better-best go-to-market model, but initial sales have exceeded our internal expectations and the most functional tier, the best category, are proving to be the most popular which could increase our software sales as this trend continues.","The Cisco ACE install base continues to be a significant replacement opportunity and Q1 was another solid quarter, with a large number of project wins. Our competitive win rate in this area continues to be extremely high. As I mentioned before, we continue to see the pattern where our customers tend include additional functionality including security access control and application acceleration. And we are already seeing examples for the new range of F5 products, combined with the good-better-best pricing strategy, reinforces this trend.","We introduced our Synthesis architecture for software-defined application services last quarter. the F5 Synthesis architectural vision has been very well-received by our customers, our channel partners and has gained wide support from technology and industry leaders. Synthesis helps customers improve service velocity and accelerates time-to-market through automated provisioning and intelligent orchestration of application services. The Synthesis architecture is based on an elastic, high-performance fabric which reduces the cost and complexity of deploying software-defined application services across all types of systems and environments. These environments include software-defined networking, virtual infrastructures, traditional on-premise data centers and both public and private clouds.","We had another solid quarter with sales of our security solutions. Security continues to be the major driver of our business with strong sales across the security solutions portfolio, including ASM, APM and AFM.","We are also building out 2 world-class security operations centers in Seattle and Tel Aviv to support a new online security service from our Versafe acquisition. Versafe adds some very strategic solutions to our security portfolio. The WebSafe and MobileSafe services include state-of-the-art technology for Internet anti-fraud, anti-phishing and anti-malware solutions. We plan to formally launch the subscription base -- this subscription-based service and RSU -- RS issue in February and we will be announcing the availability of WebSafe and MobileSafe services, including a channel partner program. We have already seen significant amount of interest in these subscription-based services.","We will also be announcing a new Secure Web Gateway solution at RSA and, obviously, we will publish more details of the event.","We experienced strong sequential and year-over-year growth in sales to the service provider market last quarter. We won several large contracts for traffic management and signaling delivery controller applications related to 4G\/LTE deployment. We recorded a record quarter of purchase orders for our Traffix SDC solutions, including sales to Tier 1 service providers in both Europe and in the U.S.A.","Actual revenue in Q1, from the SDC sales, was relatively modest, but the increase in orders bodes well for revenue growth in future quarters. In addition, we are starting to see an increase Carrier-Grade NAT wins now that we have enhanced the functionality and feature set of our Carrier-Grade NAT solution.","I'm very excited about our technology direction and the proposed deliverables on our product roadmap in the short, medium and long term. Our product roadmap priorities align well with the trends in the main areas of our business focus. You will see F5 continue to introduce significant enhancements and world-leading technology in our key areas of focus: security, service providers and mobility, the cloud and software-defined application services.","Just this week, our product development team have delivered a new TMOS Vancouver release to manufacturing. TMOS Vancouver is a very major release and includes over 130 significant new features. These features include a Secure Web Gateway solution, major performance enhancements to our virtual ADC software and utility billing features. Support for new hardware architectures, major enhancements to our service provider products, including the G.I. firewall, the policy enforcement module and our Carrier-Grade NAT solution. Vancouver, under our most recent version of BIG-IQ, also includes significant improvements to our centralized management solution for our firewall solutions: ASM, DoS protection and AFM.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we continue to expect to deliver sequential revenue growth this quarter of fiscal 2014. Obviously, we remain cautious given our experience from the March quarter last year. Having said that, we feel very positive about our market opportunities, our competitive leadership and the overall trends we are seeing with our business. Our pipeline for future business is very strong and the market drivers continued to be robust. We believe we have several tangible growth drivers for our business, including the new product refresh, the momentum in our security business and the increasing range of solutions in our security portfolio. The opportunity has been presented with 4G and LTE rollouts for our consolidation strategy and the competitive leadership of our Traffix' SDC solutions.","In addition, our Synthesis architecture for software defined application services provides F5 with the opportunities to play a very strategic role as customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures.","Q1 was a good start to fiscal 2014 and I feel very optimistic about our business prospects for the remainder of the year.","In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for the support last quarter, and we'll now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","A question with respect to sort of ranking the new incremental opportunities for calendar '14, could you rank order them between the security, the refreshed hardware, as well as the new initiatives like mobile and LTE?","John McAdam","Yes. A lot of these are interconnected, Brian, a lot of them. But if I was going to say anything, I'd say security across the board. Interestingly enough, security in the service provider space is a massive opportunity in our opinion. As I said in previous calls and we've talked about is that, frankly, our roadmap has been driven a lot by some large service provider into -- in the U.S.A., in particular. So I think security is probably the top. Traffix, we're very happy about it. We're pretty excited about Versafe. I mean, it's early, early days, we haven't announced it to the salesforce yet, that will be happening at RSU -- RSA. But that could be -- the interest level, we know, is already high. We just want to get ourselves right. ACE is going to continue to be an opportunity throughout the year. And, obviously, the product refresh is at the base of that. The other sort of wild card is the pricing that we talked about. And of course, Synthesis architecture is more about making sure that we're incredibly relevant as these trends move pretty fast, whether it's to the cloud or software-defined solutions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan of The Juda Group.","Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division","John, could you talk specifically about the carrier firewall opportunities? You've mentioned that a few times as being very good opportunities in terms of success in, specifically, firewall applications. And also, could you talk about virtual as a percentage of revenue, how that did for this quarter?","John McAdam","Yes. So I'm going to turn it over to Manny and he'll talk more about the security in the service provider space. But I know enough about it, just to give an overview. I mean, the service providers are -- obviously, security is changing dramatically. A lot of it is application-type threat. But, specifically, in the service provider space, we're talking about trying to reduce cost in an environment where the volume is increasing dramatically, obviously driven by mobile. And that's where we really excel with our new solutions. So the core product is there and what we've been building and helping with the input of customers is a lot of feature set into the BIG-IQ orchestration engine so that we can scale in those environments. And we feel very, very good about it. Trials are underway and we think it is a big opportunity. Manny?","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes. I think, just to add -- just a quick data point on that, we'll be, specifically, building on the Gi firewall, which is basically a firewall that sits in the packet core where the radio network turns over to Ethernet. And what the service providers need for mobile carrier growth is devices of high performance. And high performance not only in high throughput, which we achieved, but high connection counts. And the high connection counts are a function of all the mobile users. And then what they're looking for is, basically, firewall functionality, DDoS protection, application protection. So those are the types of features that we were putting in there. So it's feature richness at very, very high performance and very high connection counts. And our platforms are well-suited to accomplish that.","John McAdam","And as far as the VE question is concerned, we don't separate out the numbers. However, it did grow faster than our core system business and we expect it to keep doing that. Still relatively small numbers. As far as we're concerned with Synthesis, we see software and systems together, we can manage them together, we can cluster them together. They're just part of the overall solution that we've got. But yet, it did grew and we expect it to keep growing. And I think as customers move more towards the cloud, I think that's the trend and we'll make that happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum of Citigroup.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So a couple questions. First of all, I know you are no longer diving deep into the different verticals you have. But I just want to get a sense, following up on the virtual question, if we could get a sense as to how Internet guys in cloud, kind of how that faired and whether that percent of your revenue is going up. And I may have missed the answer to the virtual question, if you have sort of a percentage that will be helpful, but I'm looking more for kind of how is the revenue trending customer-wise into that customer set. And then, John, you've mentioned that Diameter was still small, but it sounds like you're very excited and the order growth is there. I'm wondering, as we look out and model it by the end of this fiscal year -- or the end of this calendar year, let's say, could it get -- could Diameter get to be 5% of your product revenue? Is it something that could be that large? Or is it still going to be small, is it much more of a 2015 revenue contributor?","John McAdam","Right, right. So regarding the verticals, I mean, the technology vertical has been fairly stable. I mean, it tends to -- it's a bit related to the service provider base so it's lumpy in nature, but it's still a sizable amount. The one thing I will say about the verticals, just to be clear, when we talk about -- obviously, we give out numbers on revenue on verticals, on an actual enterprise business, which includes the technical vertical, it was actually pretty solid from a sales perspective, so we feel pretty good about that, especially North America. So no concerns there, no certain major trends. The cloud is -- obviously, that is increasing and will continue to increase and we're putting more focus in terms of doing that. We've announced some -- we actually did some press releases with some cloud partners recently. But we're in most of the big ones that you might expect. And the other question was?","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On Diameter growth.","John McAdam","On Diameter growth, yes, yes. So, absolutely, I mean, the actual revenue in Q1 was -- modest is the word I used and that means it is pretty small. However, the number of orders was actually quite significant in terms of our win rate, I mean, we actually had replacements, as well and some Tier 1 scenarios. So I'm not going to say what we think it can be, but we definitely, assuming that we produce the goods, we're meeting the milestone, because some of these orders are multimillion dollar orders, then we would expect it to be definitely material as we get to the second half.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","John, back on the virtual question. Can you give a percent of that you've sold in the virtual, is there any way we can look at that?","John McAdam","No, we -- Ehud, we don't break that out at this time.","Ehud A. Gelblum - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Could we say it was up?","John McAdam","Oh, Karl has something here.","Karl D. Triebes","This is Karl. I was just going to mention, we've put a lot of effort on our virtual side in this last release in terms of significantly increasing the performance of the virtual additions. And we're not stopping there, we have plans to take them up another notch as we go forward. We've had different footprint options in terms of size, so you can buy very small 25 megabit -- or megabyte instance that you can use for certain circumstances in the cloud. Or you can go with much larger footprint options. We have new licensing models with utility billing. We're leveraging BIG-IQ, actually has a licensed server, so you can do pooling. So there's a lot of effort, there's a lot more than that. So when we talk about being able to operate in the cloud, it's a very vertical effort in terms of our technology, it's not just about doing kind of piece things to -- in your modules or other components.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kurtz of Stern Agee.","Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So, John, just as a follow-up on the web scale question that was just asked, I think there's been some concern, historically, that those customers are -- they're sort of changing their architecture and moving away from branded vendors. Do you feel like you maybe have troughed that event in your pipeline, looking back the last 12 months and going forward, that's sort of out of your expectations and don't really have a lot of growth expectations in those big Internet data center, hyper scale kind of customers?","John McAdam","No. I'd say -- I mean, the reality is we're talking about 2 customers. And one wasn't a customer, 2 organizations that have done some specifics in a very specific environment, with a very, very significant workforce are able to do it. We haven't seen any more. And so we still see big opportunities in that market. Across-the-board, security, for example, is a big, big opportunity in all-in-ones. So that's a key, key vertical for us that I don't believe has troughed at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First for John, I wanted to dig in to the service provider business. Specifically, I was hoping you could talk about how some of these large carrier transactions may flow through the model through the course of the year. And perhaps, you can help us understand how you're thinking about March quarter seasonality here, that this has often been weak in the March period and sometimes lump down following big quarters. So I was just hoping you can help us understand if the expected timing of big deals is giving you a little bit more confidence that we may not see the level of March quarter seasonality and the carrier vertical like we saw last year? And then for Andy, question is on the gross margin, which dipped about 50 basis points sequentially. I just wanted to confirm that the product gross margin remained unchanged and to better understand how much of the incremental investment and consulting services had already taken place and how much was still to come.","John McAdam","Yes. On the service provider space in last quarter, last year. So first of all, in the service provider space, in terms of some of the linearity, as I said, we do expect it to be immaterial from the Traffix sales in the second half. We will see improvement, as well, we're pretty confident of that, in this current quarter as well. It's interesting, I mean, you can imagine that we spent a lot of time looking at our business given the results of last -- of the March quarter last year and not just in service provider, but across the board. To be fair, we haven't really seen seasonality as such in the service provider space in the March quarter. And by that, I mean it was horrible last year and it was awesome the year before. In fact, if you remember, it was a 27% quarter, the March quarter, the year before, so that the comparison was pretty tough. We still believe it's going to be more about projects and our forecast. And we feel fairly solid about what we've done in terms of getting the salesforce over that. So I don't think we're going to see the same issue.","Andy Reinland","Yes. And then on gross margin. Yes, I did say that product margin was down just a little bit, I think 6 basis points, really nothing to that. We didn't see any change in the competitive landscape or change in discounting at all. And I also said in my comments that we think that for the next quarter, it's going to stay at this level. And on the services side, we had a great hiring quarter in Q1 and pretty weighted on the services side, the upper 30%. We're usually, we're a little below 30%. A lot of that was consulting. And now -- so that pulled that margin down and now it's trying to put that consulting to work. I also said, I think, in this quarter, we're going to be pretty much the same level on the services margin and we're going to try to manage at this level throughout the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi of UBS.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Andy, I just wanted to confirm the percentages you gave us for service provider, government and enterprise. If I did the math correctly, it seems like service provider was up quite dramatically, sequentially. So just trying to understand, were there any big deals that came through? And it doesn't seem like you saw the normal sequential decline in the worldwide government sector. So again, I just wanted to confirm if we have the numbers and the directions right and maybe if you could explain some of the dynamics.","John McAdam","Yes, this is John, actually, let me address it and if Andy wants to jump anytime. But, yes, we saw a whole bunch of large service provider deals in the quarter. Most of them in our core business, most of the revenue, that's why I mentioned about the modest -- in the Traffix area. A lot of it related to 4G, LTE. Interestingly enough, most of the success was actually outside the Americas. Americas had a decent quarter, but some of the increases came in Asia Pacific, Japan and EMEA. We had very strong sales there. Remember, the other comment I made about, generally, from a sales perspective, our enterprise business was pretty strong as well. If -- when you look at the backlog mix that happened, that was a little bit slanted towards the service provider. But also, typically, and we see this quite often, is that when we have a very strong Federal quarter at the end of September, where you get orders right in at the end of September. Some of that federal business will enter backlog and shipped out as well, that was -- probably took up a little bit more than it normally would.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And, John, just as a follow-up on the security side, particularly in the carrier space pertaining to the Gi firewall, who are you running into most often? And who do you think you're taking share from?","John McAdam","Juniper is there, so they've got a very large install base. We think that's, specifically in service provider, is a big opportunity for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian White of Cantor Fitzgerald.","Brian John White - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","John, it looks like Diameter signaling business is at some type of inflection point. I know you said the revenue was modest, but it seems like we're looking at a attractive trajectory going forward. Now I'm just wondering, how do we think about where you're seeing activity in terms of geographically? And also, are deal sizes bigger or smaller than the traditional BIG-IP business?","John McAdam","Yes. I mean, first of all, yes, the deal sizes tend to be projects and, hence, the revenue versus the sales order discussion, they tend to have milestones associated with them and they tend to be bigger, actually fairly significantly bigger, naturally. We think this is the best technology out there, that's key. And we really believe we have the best technology. We need to watch this because there's some big companies out there with some good R&D and we're making sure that we stay ahead in technology. I do think it's come to a bit of an inflation point, actually, from a sales wins perspective. I think it's really done that. It's now all about cementing those wins and increasing more business.","Brian John White - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division","And is there any particular geography that stands out where you're seeing more activity?","Manuel F. Rivelo","So, Brian, this is Manny, let me just add. So we're seeing it in all geographies. Obviously, all providers are moving toward LTE, 4G networks. And in the next 2 years, we're projecting to see almost all of them go to that. So we're seeing it across the board. We're seeing it in Europe, we're seeing it in Asia and we're definitely seeing it in the Americas, which probably led this -- the 4G movement was led by the Americas. But to John's point on the technology leadership, our portfolio solves problems that most of the portfolios in the industry don't solve. We provide both DRA, DEA, in a working functionality and support over 30 of the Diameter signaling protocols that are out there, which allows us to really inter-operate with just about any service provider, with just about any component that's out there. So that's just giving us a huge competitive advantage. And then part of the challenge, as you very well know, this is going into a very strategic part of their network. Consequently, proof of concepts take a period of time to make sure if they're working inside those environments. And then, over time, is the acceptance by tier, which leads to consulting work that we need to continue to do so. We're pretty excited about the win so far and we continue to see incremental orders from those that we won, as well as new business. So hopefully, 20- -- the rest of this year will pay out and 2015 we will even be more successful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rohit Chopra of Wedbush.","Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask John, has there been any revenue through the Cisco partnership yet or any engagements that you can talk about? That's the first question. The second one is for Andy. As far as -- and I know you have to wait for the announcement at RSA, but as far as the building out of the operation centers for the new subscription security product, does that have any impact on the model from an expense standpoint near term? And then when do you think the revenue impact actually hits the model?","John McAdam","Yes, on the Cisco partnership, we've been focusing on technologies and links and roadmap with them, as we have been doing with VMware, as well. There have been engagements, tactical engagements, in geographies. We've seen that in the past, I actually said that in the last call, so I wouldn't really call that out yet.","Andy Reinland","Yes. And on the stocks that we have in Tel Aviv in Seattle, yes, there's an up-front investment there. Some of it, in particular in Seattle, is CapEx. So it will be recognized over time. And the staffing, with Versafe coming in, we had a level of staffing there. So we're going to be adding to that and getting them trained up in anticipation of orders. The thing to point out here for revenue is this is going to be a subscription model. So really what you're going to see over time is that buildup of subscription on the balance sheet that then we'll recognize over time. So I think it will be a slow take-up. But the main message is, yes, it's an upfront investment, but not -- one we think that we can manage in our current gross margin structure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kent Schofield of Goldman Sachs.","Justin Jordan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It's Justin Jordan filling in for Kent. Two questions. How should we think about hiring, going forward, given you hired a little bit more than expected in this past quarter? And also, are there any new Cisco displacements to announce? Or where -- are you going to -- how much traction are you seeing in the market with that?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So on the hiring front, I mean, we said on our last call that we plan to be pretty aggressive on hiring. And we did. We had a great quarter this quarter, at 165. For the second quarter, we're going to bring those people in, get them on-boarded. That number will pull back a little bit. We said we're going to be over 100 this time. But I wouldn't read anything into that, it's just bringing people on, managing the expenses as we go forward. But I think you're going to see us continue to be pretty aggressive with particular focus on sales. It's just we're going to have -- want to crank up the salesforce as we see these opportunities developing.","John McAdam","Yes. On the ACE opportunity, no, it still remains to be very strong. We saw some more Fortune 500 wins, brand new, which is clearly good, because we tend to sell a lot into those accounts. We also saw -- typically, North America had been leading the parade, but we're starting to see that happening in Europe and in Asia as well. So, as I said earlier, actually, I think it's probably a 2-year, at least, opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to see if maybe you could provide a little bit of perspective from a macro, following on IBM's commentary last night, that bellwether was somewhat uninspiring and Cisco's guidance last month, somewhat uninspiring. You're selling it into similar markets in terms of data centers and tech. Maybe just if you could step back and sort of help folks understand how you're different than what the bellwethers are indicating.","John McAdam","Yes. I mean, there's a couple of things and, obviously, I can't talk for these companies here. I don't know as much details, probably, as you do. However, I know that they have entered the emerging markets. We haven't seen that, we have said that, in the past, that China is a top market, it actually continues to be that in this kind of quarter. But overall, we're actually happy about the emerging markets. And a lot of that is driven by security and mobility, in mobility, specifically, in emerging markets. So I don't think we've got the same issues. I think the other thing is that we embraced the whole concept with our Synthesis architecture and before that, with the way the R&D was to enter the whole software portfolio that we have. I think that, Stanley, is very well moving forward in terms of being very relevant to the technology trends of software-defined networking of the cloud. So I'm not sure we're quite in the same example as some of the much larger companies.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just one clarification. Last quarter, you talked about operating margins in the back half of the fiscal year of being in the upper 30s. Just want to revisit and see if you can confirm that's still true?","Andy Reinland","Yes, we did make that statement and we've made no change to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","John, if I look back a year ago, things were pretty tough, the company was growing in the mid- to low-single digits. I think you classified as a year of 2 halves. Now we're seeing this re-acceleration. And the simple extrapolation is that F5 has new products, so you're seeing some catch-up of delayed purchases since you now have a refresh. Or do you feel it's more expansive than that? Perhaps the ADC market is becoming more important, virtualization is accelerating. So maybe how that all ties into some qualitative thoughts of larger deals, architectural projects and how that's shaping for the whole year, so that it's -- this is not just a transitory new product refresh?","John McAdam","Okay. I'll leave Manny to talk about the ADC market and what he sees there and other parts of the question. But I do think -- we've always alluded to this a lot, given a year ago. We've done the product transition. We couldn't really put a number out there in terms of what the issues were from a delayed perspective, but it's pretty certain it was -- it's a significant number, that's over. Traffix has, obviously, started to build some momentum. Our security portfolio solution has increased dramatically. I think that's something to remember. And also our name in security has increased dramatically and our channel's ability to execute. So there's some really key issues that, I think, are very, very different from last year. And Manny?","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes. And what I would add, Mark, to it is, is that the ADC market has grown a lot, changed a lot over the last 5 years. Where I think if you go back about 5 years ago, it was predominantly a traffic management market. And over the last 5 years, it's consumed a lot of new services. Services to not only make applications available, but also make them secure and make them faster. You will give them more performance characteristics. As a result of that, the relevance of that ADC market has grown, whether it be on-prem or in the cloud or a hybrid environment. And that's really what we're seeing. And our strategy that we've been implementing with Synthesis is actually to do that, to create a set of services that sits on top of any network fabric that are highly elastic that can enhance that user-application experience, making it fast, secure and available, no matter where the user may reside, on-prem and\/or at home or on the road. And that's really been what we've been focusing on and we're seeing that pay off in the market. Not only in the traditional enterprise markets, but also in the service provider market, because a lot of what you're seeing happening in the service provider market is monetization strategies where you're trying to move more applications to those mobile devices. So I think the ADC, its importance is growing, and rapidly, in all the new architectures that are out there.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So a lot of it does point to your sustainable trends, I guess, from John and your comments, Manny?","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes. I believe that there's going to being large sustainable trends and you'll see market shifts occurring over the next decade.","Operator","And our last question will come from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Andy, one for you and one for John. Andy, a little bit more aggressive cash usage in the quarter on the buyback, pretty good price that you got out of that, relative to where it's at now. So was there -- and with the incremental allocation here, any change in philosophy on buybacks? Should we expect more healthy levels like we just saw this last quarter on the buyback going forward? And then, John, just curious on the product refresh impacts, I think you mentioned the ACE replacement and Traffix and security has really long-term trends, how long do you think the product refresh, from the last 12 or 18 months, can help results? And when do you think we'll need to maybe touch up some of those products in the portfolio?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So on the buyback, yes, you're right, we -- definitely was a much stronger buyback, given the share price. As the board set price targets, it triggered to the quarter and I think took advantage of a good opportunity for us to act on that. And then we're going to continue to execute with the board, based on the 10b5-1 plan that puts price targets in place. I think the increase of $500 million sends a message. We'll see how that executes out. But they approved it and so we're going to take that direction and send our 10b5-1 and go accordingly.","John McAdam","And then regarding the product refresh, if you look historically, there certainly have been 2 to 3 years of growth that we would assign directly to that, no reason to think that's different. The other thing just well among the subject, but I also -- we feel -- it's still early days, a little bit cautious saying this, but it was -- the good-better-best pricing, I think, is going to go hand-in-hand with that, obviously, from a software module perspective. The other thing, the lesson we've learned big time, is that when we do the refresh the next time, it will not be as elongated now. It won't take over such a long time as we've done before. And probably, we'll be more -- going to be more aggressive about the timing between the refresh. And Karl might want to comment on that.","Karl D. Triebes","Yes. I mean, I talked about this at the Analyst Day. But we are going to be definitely -- we've already actually started our design cycle in terms of looking at the roadmap and where we're going to be refreshing the appliances. But having said that, we're also introducing, every release, new hardware and new variance of our platforms. And we just released the 2250 blade, the new high-end VIPRION blade that runs over almost 4X the performance in layer 7. It's got a bunch of other features with multi-tenancy and other things. And we have new hardware that will be coming out in each release as we go forward, including some upcoming ones later this year. So we're continually adding to our high-end, we're continually adding to the platforms, but we will be starting, in terms of when we start refreshing things, we'll be refreshing them at different cadence. And part of our cadence is aligning with some of our component vendors to make sure that we're right at the cutting-edge of when they're releasing their next-generation components, so that we're aligned with that. And we were -- as part of the last release was that alignment and we think we're in that cadence now that we can drive towards. So...","John Eldridge","Okay. Thank you very much for joining us.

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. In the third quarter of fiscal 2012, F5 achieved solid sequential and year-over-year growth in what proved to be a challenging macro environment. Revenue of $352.6 million grew 4% from the prior quarter and 21% from the third quarter of last year and was within our guided range of $350 million to $355 million. GAAP EPS of $0.91 per diluted share was above our guidance of $0.88 to $0.90 per diluted share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.14 per diluted share was at the high end of our $1.12 to $1.14 guided range.","Product revenue of $207.1 million grew 15% year-over-year and represented 59% of total revenue. Service revenue of $145.5 million grew 31% year-over-year and accounted for 41% of total revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was less than one. During Q3, our core Application Delivery Networking business accounted for $346.3 million and revenue from our ARX File Virtualization business was $6.3 million.","From a geographic perspective all theatres generated sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. At 57% of total, the Americas grew 22% year-over-year, EMEA accounted for 21% of revenue, an increase of 27% versus Q3 of 2011. APAC represented 15% of the revenue mix with 17% growth year-over-year and Japan was 7% of revenue, up 9% over a strong Q3 of 2011.","Looking at our key verticals, Telco accounted for 22% of sales. Sales in to the finance vertical represented 23% of total. Our US federal business equaled 6% of sales with total government at 12% and technology accounted for 16% of total sales.","In Q3, we had two greater than 10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 17.3% of total revenue and Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.8%. Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $182.3 million were within our guided range of $180.5 to $184.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $161.3 million.","GAAP operating margin was 31.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 35.2% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34%.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q3, we continued to strengthen our financial position. Cash flow from operations was $113.4 million contributing to total cash and investments of $1.1 billion at quarter end. Free cash flow for the quarter was $107.7 million. DSO at the end of Q3 was 49 days. Inventories were $17 million. Deferred revenue increased 5% sequentially to $433.9 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.7 million and depreciation and amortization expense was $10.1 million.","We ended the quarter with approximately 2,905 employees, an increase of 100 from the prior quarter. During Q3, we repurchased approximately 425,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $117.59 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately $231 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.","Looking ahead to Q4, we continue to see the key drivers of our business including mobile traffic growth, data center consolidation, growth in virtual environments and security concerns trending in our favor. We see solid growth in our software sales and we see strong momentum with our security products. We also have an exciting product roadmap that positions us to take advantage of an expanding addressable market. As a result, we continue to believe our prospects for long-term growth remain strong. That said, the context of a weak global economy lead us to be more cautious in our near-term outlook.","With this in mind, our guidance for the current quarter is as follows. Our revenue target for Q4 is $360 million to $370 million. We expect GAAP gross margin to remain strong in the 83% range including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of  $188 million to $195 million including approximately $24 million of stock-based compensation expense and $200,000 in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","Our GAAP EPS target is $0.90 to $0.93 per diluted share and our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.16 to $1.19 per diluted share. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper-40 day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $17 million to $19 million and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $135 million.","With that I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy and good afternoon everyone. I was very pleased with our Q3 performance. In a difficult macro environment, we delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 21% and world class non-GAAP operating margins above [30]% and continued to strengthen our balance sheet with strong cash generation.","Our major sales region, each major sales region produced double-digit sales bookings growth. Our services business had another stellar quarter exceeding both revenue and profit goals as well as posting a very significant increase in the Fed revenue. Sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 82% from last year. Software module sales during the quarter were also very strong and the percentage of tax rate for our software sales reached a record high in Q3 driven by rapidly accelerating sales of our security software products.","Sales of our data center firewall solution grew sequentially over last quarter and we expect that momentum to continue into next year. Our security solution portfolio now includes the most comprehensive application firewall solution in the market, the highest performing datacenter firewall solution for protecting large scale web-based applications and industry-leading access and policy management solutions.","I believe that F5 continues to be well positioned to capitalize on major market trends. Our platforms deliver an array of intelligence services for enterprises, service providers and clouds. Our customers use F5 technology at strategic points of control to consolidate functions on our platforms and to design and deploy our dynamic networks to efficiently deal with the ever increasing challenges presented by the growth in video traffic, evolving and more sophisticated security threats and adoption of mobile devices.","Our product roadmap contains several growth drivers including a comprehensive product refresh of all our appliances which will deliver a very significant price performance advantage to our customers. In addition, performance of our virtual additions for all high provider platforms will be tripled. We also are building an eight floor VIPRION chassis solution which will leverage the centaur blades released in Q3 and set a new buyer for layers four to seven performance, so ADC functions including security and optimization. ","The next major release of TMOS contains significant software deliverables including DPI, DPAC Inspection functionality for the service provider market as well as a market leading layer three to layer seven firewall solution. This integrated firewall will be a module available across all F5 platforms allowing customers to consolidate the current firewall infrastructure while provided unprecedented performance and slight stability by allowing security policies to be applied at the network and the application levels. ","The DPI functionality will be another strategic offering for the service provider market. We now have a broad portfolio of solutions for the service provider market including our recently acquired diameter signaling product for the management of 4G LTE and IMS network, our carrier grade NAT and IPv 6 capability and the speeding functionality derived from a sophisticated iRules running on TMOS. ","We will also introduce significant updates to our virtualizations and management products which will make it easier for customers to adopt hybrid cloud architectures and optimize the delivery of web based applications. We continue to focus on delivering to our customers as many application layer decisions per second as possible and using that knowledge to drive orchestration applications both real and virtual within and across data centers. ","We believe this capability generate significant value and benefits to our customers and clearly differentiate our technology from that of our competitors. Many companies in this market talk about performance just from a throughput perspective or intelligence at the application there. F5 not only provides the highest bandwidth, but also is the only ADC vendor to deliver application intelligence at network speeds and beyond. As traffic and applications continue to become more web centric, I believe the market is rapidly moving towards F5 sweet spot. Our world class connection and transaction processing capabilities combined with high speed pattern matching and purpose built hardware enable F5 to deliver advanced solutions for optimization, security and application delivery for many years to come.","As far as the outlook is concerned Andy indicated we expect to see sequential growth this quarter. There is no doubt that we experienced a cautious spending environment last quarter and we expect that caution to continue into this quarter. Even with these economic headwinds, I remain very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as strong as it has ever been under our product roadmap will extend that leadership.","We will continue to invest in hiring world class people to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC market and to enable us to further exploit new expanding market opportunities in the employee based architectures to security market and the service provider market. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and their partners and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. We will now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Ehud Gelblum from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","A couple of questions. Can you, with the new versions of TMOS coming out now, do you anticipate any new hardware platforms coming out as well. Do you anticipate the new hardware platforms to gain more share than otherwise would have or see some sort of an upgrade across the product portfolio because it would be necessary to get the EPI working and then some of the other features in the new versions of TMOS or is it more of a minor upgrade on TMOS?","John McAdam","","This is John and maybe Karl could speak up to me, but this is very significant in my opinion. In two fronts, first of all, the actual, we are doing appliances refresh. That\u2019s a number of significant new products and we are going to see performance increases in those appliances to the tune of about that five times the current performance of the existing systems. ","So we expect that to definitely create some good growth refresh opportunities and market share with that. We very, very doubted it in doing that. And then, along with that, we\u2019re also coming out with a new version of TMOS that\u2019s got a software functionality with things like the firewall through layer three to layer seven firewall product so the things are going to be very, very competitive along with functionality for the SP provider like DPI. So we really believe they are revenue generating type capabilities.","Karl Triebes","","Yeah, we start looking, by the way this is Karl, if we start looking at some of the functionality and the impact with DPI, we have a whole new classification engine that\u2019s been built up into the core of TMOS. So that\u2019s a very significant change and that we\u2019ve done a lot of other under the hood changes in TMOS, spot other requirements in the search for other markets such as very specific targeted iRules, we have done some other work there with productizing some of the carrier grade NAT features, a lot of focus on IPv 6 and carrying that forwards. So there is a lot of work has been done there. And obviously on the security, a lot of the development that has been there has been extending essentially what's been done in the past are really productizing things and adding capabilities around the rules and Having a new rule saying which in other things that can be applied not only at the network layer but at the application layer as well and having these things all tied together cleanly in a management framework. So it is a very complete, a very big upgrade to what we had previously.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley ","As a follow-up the verticals seemed to move around a little bit obviously Telco and Tech were down some, is some of the trepidation going to next quarter obviously it is on a big macro basis but can we, it is accurate to say that you are more obviously worried but more concerned about some of those verticals like Telco and Tech that came down I know you except Telco to come down with very strong last quarter but does it look as though those will stay weak going to next quarter is that one of the main drivers behind the despite the more conservative guidance?","John McAdam","No I would say its more overall macro has been specifically in the verticals. I mean typically our verticals move around depending on project and we don\u2019t see any significant deterioration and any of the verticals obviously technology has been doing somewhat for they have been quite often you know instead of having layer seven type capabilities and made it done some of them do their own work but that's been a pretty slow process so nothing really changing in the verticals.","Operator","And then our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities your line is open.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities","Question and a clarification, for the question can you talk about some of the demand trends you experienced in Europe it actually looks like the business performed fairly well from the sequential one in year-over-year perspective, would like to get some additional details regarding where you saw the strength? Where you saw the weakness in the region and how you are thinking about your guidance for the September quarter and then for the clarification I was hoping you could discuss how much revenue you received from Traffix in the period?","John McAdam","Yeah, so in terms of Europe it was probably you would expect you know so areas like the UK where we are very strong and France, Germany, the key geographies were pretty solid. Europe has been very out in the lead in terms of security sales as well. That has helped a lot and to be fair it was a pretty easy comparison just as the same quarter and a year ago but generally we are very, very happy with the things that have been performing. In terms of Traffix yes we did revenue, it wasn\u2019t significant, what I could, you know we really view that as part of our ADCs. We are not going to be giving that out. I think the message I gave last quarter and that's still the same as we will see some revenue at Traffix next quarter as we did this quarter however we really think that the major opportunity is fiscal 2013. ","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities","John for the September quarter, do you expect Europe to be up sequentially?","John McAdam","We haven't got through each geography on that.","Andy Reinland","Yeah, Jess we don't guide by geography. So I think in our overall guidance we are taking the European market in the macro into consideration and as usual putting guidance out there that we forget about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan. Your line is open.","Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group","I wanted to ask a question on service versus product revenues if you look at growth of the product revenues or lack there are, how do you expect the trend going forward given the significant difference on a sequential basis and also if I could follow-up on the different verticals looking out is there one vertical that causes you to be more concerned especially the question was asked on Telco if I could ask again it was down more than expected as a percentage of revenue?","John McAdam ","On Telco, Telco was doing as we expected probably may be slightly better than we expected but not a lot better so it\u2019s pretty much within the realms of what we are looking at.","Andy Reinland","","And then in terms of your original question the product revenue versus service site, obviously product revenue is our main priority in product revenue growth and at 41% service is higher than we have seen it or probably want to see it and I think as we drive forward and given the guidance that we put out there we may see that stay in the same range but over time obviously our goal is to get the product revenue up.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Sanjiv Wadhwani - Stifel Nicolaus ","Thanks so much. Just one clarification and then a question. John your financial services vertical actually performed very well which kind of seems counter intuitive given the environment, can you just talk about what might be going on over there? And then question is, as far as the progression of the quarter can you just talk about if kind of things weakened as the quarter is progressing month over month to any sort of clarification that would be helpful? Thanks.","John McAdam ","The linearity of the quarter was pretty similar to other quarters. It was, we did say in our opening remarks that we did definitely experienced the macro environment there, but it was pretty similar, there wasn\u2019t a significant I mean there was some backend loading and no question about that.","Andy Reinland","","Yeah, I think just add to that. I think if you look at our month three, it was a little higher than we would expect, but I think the bigger message is in the deal flow. It was more backend loaded within that month that we would comfortable with. And one thing I would like to add in there is of the backlog where it\u2019s a backlog less than one, it\u2019s interesting to note that that was really roughly 1%. So not a significant amount down, but as we do reported, I wanted to put it out there that it was down.","John McAdam","","And then just to answer the question on the financial vertical, we did expect the financial vertical to go up. Again, it\u2019s similar to what I said in the previous answer and its very project oriented and very pipeline oriented in terms of how we do that verticals or not, while we made the comments that we made, so it was. Actually Dave Feringa, whose just been recently promoted, I am sure you\u2019ve seen the Executive VP of worldwide sales. Previously we\u2019ve been doing 50% of our business with North America for the last seven years; he might want to comment on some of the financial. Not on each of the customers, but some of the deals that we did.","Dave Feringa","","Yeah, we saw some very, very large deals across all theaters last quarter and specifically in the Americas, we saw two very, very significant deals. One from a very large bank, who has also been telling people that they need to grow with to reduce costs to adjust their self to their new revenue models and they actually invested close to $5 million with us in the refresh opportunity to consolidate.","And then we had another very large financial institution in the DC area that also, was actually a competitive replacement that also invested almost $3 million worth or so. Even in kind of tough times for that vertical, they\u2019re spending money where they can see, they can gain lots of efficiencies. So, I think that was a good reason why we had a good quarter in the finance vertical.","John McAdam","","Actually you can figure that when we talk finance, we absolutely talk globally. So this type of trend is happen all the time globally.","Dave Feringa","","Absolutely, we had big deals in Asia-Pac and in Europe as well.","Operator","","And our next question comes from Paul Mansky with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Paul Mansky - Cantor Fitzgerald","","On the headcount front, I think we were targeting about 125 in the quarter, you did a 100 and we\u2019re looking at 125 again for the next quarter. I know you guys have puts and takes relative to hitting the bogey on any given quarter, but should we read anything into that 100 versus 125 as it relates to maybe how long do you think the kind of the macro pressures might persist?","Andy Reinland","","You know, definitely as we went through the quarter, we talk a lot about how we manage expenses as we\u2019re watching the quarter unfold and as we both mentioned in our scripts in this tougher macro environment as we watch the size up, we got more cautious with our hiring. But did continue to hire and as we look at next quarter with what we think we\u2019ll achieve in terms of revenue as you\u2019ve seen in the guidance put out there, we think we can absorb the 125.","But what I would like to highlight in these comments is that we do want to keep hiring because we want to invest in growth and we see the opportunity there, but as we\u2019ve said over and over again, we will invest in a way that protects our operating margin and we\u2019re committed to the 38% levels. So I think you won\u2019t see our behavior change in how we manage the business week in and week out.","Paul Mansky - Cantor Fitzgerald","And then if I could just follow up, historically you did a really good job of managing the product cycle. However, as you think about timing of the generation of TMOS in conjunction with obviously your sweeping appliance refresh, is there any concern relative to maybe demand push out around the timing of those two things happening to be coinciding a little bit more tightly than historical?","John McAdam","No, we again, I always have been asked that question for almost about 10 years; it should be and I don\u2019t want to come over this complacent, but I feel really, really positive the way we can manage the new products coming in. And typically in any case the products, the existing products have refreshed or often redeployed and so we don\u2019t often see that; and I don\u2019t think there us going to be an issue there. The key for us is to actually get the roadmap on track and get these growth opportunities early as soon as possible.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson Noland - Robert Baird","Okay thanks. John just your previous comment on sales turnover did that cause any challenges or confusion through the quarter?","John McAdam","I don\u2019t think we talk at all about sales turnover; obviously Mark Anderson moved on and that was a shame, but with Dave, he has been running North America has moved in and we have also replaced Dave by an internal recruitment as well. So the things are basically moving, frankly we are not really missing a beat there, but we didn\u2019t comment on earlier so I don\u2019t you heard that. ","Jayson Noland - Robert Baird","I was referring to at the executive level there that\u2019s what I\u2026.","John McAdam","Oh, I am sorry, okay.","Jayson Noland - Robert Baird","On security from my question, you know congratulations on the progress and I guess the question is do you have what you need or can you develop it organically or should we expect some M&A there?","John McAdam","Well, we are developing a law organically and we have a law already in the portfolio that I mentioned, but there's, you know the stuff that's coming in the next TMOS solution is very, very important.","And then we are always looking across the market for the increased opportunities, but absolutely one of the things that we've been debating internally and just how do we do it is in October and certainly in November the Analyst Day, we are going to say that we have given you much more visibility to the security sales that we\u2019ve got. It\u2019s not trivial because it\u2019s very subjective in nature, but we are going to put a lot of effort into that and I think most people will be pretty impressed by the rate of growth that we are seeing for security.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rohit Chopra with Wedbush.","Rohit Chopra - Wedbush","John I am going to ask you another question, you have probably been asked a lot of times, but given the new version of TMOS has a lot more capability in it, classification engine and what not. How far back can you go as far as compatibility; in other words, would you expect a greater upgrade at the base with this new version of TMOS? And the other question I just want to ask you about competition, there is a little bit more competition out there I thought maybe you could comment on that and who you are seeing and what's going on?","Karl Triebes","Yes, hi Rohit this is Karl. I just wanted to mention, so in terms of software when we come out with new versions we make that available on all of our hardware platforms to the extent that they are able to accept it. So multiple generations of platforms typically could be upgraded to the latest releases, they may not run all features because whatever limitations they have, but we generally make most available. And that's no different for any large release that we are doing; you know this upcoming release is no different than any of the other releases that we've done in the past with regards to that.","John McAdam","Yeah, typically what we see there is obviously we see customers being cautious with the new release itself where and exactly the same with nine, 10 and 11 we will see the same coming again. Having said that, one of the drivers to really speed up customers tends to be specific functionality, so if a customer is really specific in terms of the need and what they can benefit from say DPI they will go at it faster, but that will be a pretty natural process.","Karl Triebes","Right, and with our chassis based products too, the nice thing there is that a lot of our customers are feature proof; that is if they need more capacity for the new features for example they are able to just add blades to the system quite easily, so that's already built into that.","Dan Matte","","Rohit, this is Dan Matte, so on the competitive environment front, in the macro stories we haven't seen really big changes. We've picked up some share actually across the core ADC market, we've seen actually great growth in our virtual additions as well, so I think we are being pretty disruptive on that side of things. Also on the security side with the performance of our datacenter firewall and sales on that front, again we think we are being pretty disruptive in that market. We look at our win rates as reported by our sales team, continue to be extremely high out there; so overall I think we are sitting quite well.","Operator","","And our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Northland Securities. Your line is open.","Catharine Trebnick - Northland Securities","My question is your used cases for the carrier space, can you go through those? And the other one would be are there any regions you are seeing, any carrier softness over other regions? Thanks.","Karl Triebes","Yeah this is Karl. We have a number of different areas, used cases that is in the service provider, everything from Carrier Grade NAT, IPv6 like I mentioned earlier doing things with in their managed services environment, web hosting those types of things. Optimization, we help optimize video delivery of content or web applications that they are handling.","Again, with the signaling traffic we help to scale that for example we can scale diameter set and radius; we also now with our Traffix acquisition we now have a full signaling -- we call it our [SPC] release, we have now a full standard signaling capability and routing capability there. So there is a lot of areas that we were leveraged in this and again like John said earlier they tend to be project oriented, but it\u2019s a pretty big footprint there. With the new upcoming DPI functionality we are hoping to expand that footprint and consolidate a lot of functionality that exist in platforms that tend to be around us.","Catharine Trebnick - Northland Securities","Alright quick, another just a quick question follow-on. I did not hear when the TMOS version with DPI would be released, could you repeated the timeframe?","Karl Triebes","Yeah we said at the end of this year.","Catharine Trebnick - Northland Securities","Okay. And then do you have any data that\u2019s now underway with the DPI technology?","Karl Triebes"," ","Yeah we have, we have had as I have mentioned before in the previous calls we have beta versions out for a while at different various stages of development process the customers been looking at.","Operator","And our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Simon Leopold - Raymond James","Great, thank you very much. I wanted to just get a little bit of more clarification particularly on the financial vertical discussion; quite a big number in what\u2019s a tough environment. Are there any metrics you can give us in terms of the largest deal size or concentration and really what I am trying to get at is to understand the sustainability versus the lumpiness of that particular vertical?","And then in terms of the question, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the concept of virtualizing the ADC function in terms of kind of the timeframe of when that could be deployed, particularly by the technology vertical which might be early adopters and what that would mean for your product portfolio and your business over, let's say, three to five years?","Karl Triebes","","On the last one, I am not sure of it is three to five years because that\u2019s, I don\u2019t want to make that prediction when it's so far out. But in terms of the virtual ADC, we have now probably got the largest array of solutions out there from a software-only perspective in terms of the ADC type solutions. In other words, a core LTE product, virtual as well as all the modules as well, security modules, optimization modules. And that\u2019s been going extremely well. It\u2019s still a small proportion of our business, but a very fast, high percentage growing portion. We see a lot of hybrid sales. So we will see sales for the software version as well as the system version and the beauty is that we can manage them similarly. So the customer can mix and match depending on the area and you\u2019re right, cloud is probably the main area of opportunity there. But in terms of going three to five years, that\u2019s a bit tough.","Dan Matte","","And Simon, this is Dan. So while we\u2019re not prognosticating on the size of that portion of the market. Fortunately there are others who do and so the target for the virtualized part of the market, it runs about roughly 10% of the overall market sort of about in that timeframe that you\u2019re talking about. And so what we\u2019re doing about it, as John said, the sales of our virtual additions are going really well. We\u2019re giving our customers versions of our products that they can inject in to cloud providers themselves. We\u2019ve also started our cloud licensing programs. So using the cloud vendors as more of a channel for us, so they can take that functionality if you will and rent it to their customers on an ongoing basis. So that's really tapping into a customer base that otherwise it will be more difficult for us to address.","John McAdam","And then just going back to the financial vertical. I mean there's numbers in the financial vertical. Obviously weighed by percents over time, but have been very resilient and have been very resilient even through the 2009 time scale when that was probably at its lowest ebb from an opportunity perspective. So I think it is very sustainable. I think it is going to be one of our three key verticals for the foreseeable future.","Brian White - Topeka Capital Markets","And any indication of the concentration or where there several very large projects or anything like that?","John McAdam","No I mean Dave obviously talked about some of the projects, but nothing of the ordinary. They tend to be reasonably big in nature, but they are very common as well and I've said a couple of times, they are global as well.","Andy Reinland","I mean and just adding on to that, Dave mentioned a couple of larger deals on the financial vertical, but putting it in perspective, broadly our average orders sizes is just above a 100,000. So I think though we do win very significant figure dollar deals on average, our average order size is just above a 100,000. So I think that helps put it in perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian White from Topeka Capital Markets. Your line is open","Brian White - Topeka Capital Markets","And John when did you start to pick up signs of increased caution with customers?","John McAdam","We look at our business weekly and you're never really sure until you get into that last month and then obviously in the last couple of weeks as when it becomes very specific, where you can start to see committed deals being non-committed, that's typically the process that we see.","Brian White - Topeka Capital Markets","Okay and I know you didn\u2019t want to talk about you know the weakest market in September quarter but what do you think is going to be the strongest market in September quarter?","Andy Reinland","Yeah, again we don't guide the verticals so when we look at that pretty broadly and then take that into the guidance that we put out there. I mean the key things we look you know I would say this a number of times but its definitely the pipeline, its definitely the factor pipeline in other words the pipeline that's pretty mature and has got very, very good chance of closing and then the assumed close rates and obviously in this environment we think we are being sufficiently cautious on the closer rate.","Brian White - Topeka Capital Markets","You don't think there's any change in the competitive landscape, this is all macro caution?","Andy Reinland","There's always some change in it, but I think it's been a significant versus macro? No.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kent Schofield with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Kent Schofield - Goldman Sachs","Can you talk a little bit about increasing the performance availability on the software ADC side, some of the cloud features and then how that plays out with selling into some of those technology customers that are doing some of their own work. Thank you.","Dan Matte","Sure, so Kent, this is Dan Matte, it's a couple of things, so one with the virtual additions themselves, we are going to be increasing the performance. We think we already have great performance within our virtual additions but we will crank that up even more. Another aspect that we are working on to is allowing people to stream multiple versions of those together and act as one coherent unit, so as we think about many of these larger players and think about having a ","totally software defined data center if you will so everything looks the same inside of it, you are changing the personality of the devices solely by software. We think that we\u2019ve got a very interesting way to help them do that and utilize our software from that perspective. ","The other piece that I mentioned to is different go-to-market models as well. So we think there are other ways to exploit better get our products into what I have called the serverless generation so people coming up with new companies who are not likely to build their own data centers or purchase servers or anything like that, they are just going to be renting infrastructure from various players out there we just want to make sure we have got that covered. ","And then also we recognized that people have different ways of adopting cloud technology and whether they are doing it internally in private clouds as I said, the serverless generation purely in a public or those in between with hybrid. So we definitely have technology coming that allows people to use as much or as little as both of those are simultaneously use both as they would like and make it seamless so that the cloud is just another resource that they are able to drop on.","Kent Schofield - Goldman Sachs","And then you mentioned the high attach of software modules. Is that a level that you think it\u2019s where is going to be or do you think with the coming products that\u2019s that you could see higher attach going forward?","John McAdam ","I think we can see higher attach. It\u2019s a number of things I mean, I mentioned security the application firewalls is a very good example. And the access policy manager for access. They have two very, very strong momentum modules right now. As we add more modules like DPI, like the bigger function firewall is coming I think you will see a more module connect and then the other thing that\u2019s critical as sales execution in this area sales and SE and service execution where not just, we started off with North America being the leader. But we are now seeing areas like Japan and the rest of APAC and Europe also doing extremely well with the modules and realizing it\u2019s a differentiator. And then the fact that we have our Viprion chassis solutions ideal for building more and more modules on the one platform. So I do, I think it\u2019s a great strategy and it should increase the tax rate.","Operator","","And our next question comes from Ryan Hutchinson with Lazard Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Ryan Hutchinson - Lazard Capital Markets","","I have somewhat of a follow-up on just the overall security strategy and John you touched on the prepared remarks. Maybe it\u2019s question for Dan or Erik if he is there but I just wanted to understand where we are headed here. You clearly are looking to build out a comprehensive solution. You\u2019re covering some aspects of it but I just wanted to get, where are we in 12 to 24 months? Do we cover network protocol, app and access security and is Project Topaz does that fulfill the needs or is there more to come beyond that and I guess the real question is who ultimately are we going to be competing with? Thanks.","Manny Rivelo","","So this is Manny Rivelo. So Ryan, let me answer that question. A couple of things, first of all, we have two major use cases if you will. One of them is really around, what I would call unified access and around unified access is the whole concept of ensuring that we know who the user is and we contextually can create an identity of that user, identifying the who, what, when, where and how of what that users try to do and then enable them to access those services, whether they be on network or off network. ","So that\u2019s a very strong in this case. We\u2019ve been getting a lot of market share there and not just recently it was reported by Infonetics where we moved to the position number two from market share perspective.","The other use case everyone working a lot which is around Project Topaz is really where the firewall defending your applications and that is a layer three to layer seven firewall technology, high performance, high throughput, high connection count, high, high concurrent connection and what that basically has is everything from Layer 3 DDoS protection to all the way to application on ability protection, all wrapped up in one solution set and that by all means is a product that we currently have in the market, wildly successful with that market and we\u2019re going to continue to create further integration with Project Topaz in the next software release.","So when you think about the competitors across those two different markets, on one end, we\u2019re competing against identity bridges and vendors of that size, and the data center firewall, we\u2019re competing against Juniper, Cisco, Palo Alto, but to be perfectly frank, none of those companies have focused on a web solution set. So although they are competitors, they\u2019re not really the right solution to the market at this time.","Karl Triebes","","The other thing I will add. You asked the question about the next 12, 24 months. Obviously, this is a starting point. We\u2019ve got others, and we have some other significant things we are building into the platform itself such as like DDoS adding significantly to our hardware capabilities there. A lot of security features in ASM, you know things in the future we\u2019re looking at malware prevention. There is a lot of factors that we can go after, but once we have this footprint, this capability and this performance, you know that\u2019s the big enabler.","John Eldridge","","Okay. Thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter. I\u2019ll see on the road sometime soon. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect."],"8738":["F5 Networks, Inc.

Thank you for joining us today. I will talk briefly to our business drivers before handing over to Frank to review the quarter's results in detail.","We delivered a solid Q1, overachieving on earnings with revenue growth of 4%. Year-on-year software growth of 21% drove our third sequential quarter of product revenue growth. Focusing on software, public cloud continues to be our strongest software growth area in this quarter, we also saw increasing demand for our security solutions, particularly Advanced Web Application Firewalls. Our new software consumption models, including Virtual Edition subscription and ELAs also contributed to software growth in the quarter. Our ELA pipeline continues to grow, accelerating in Q1, and we expect ELA sales to continue to pick up as our customers continue to shift to multi-cloud deployments.","Overall, our software story is evolving to plan, putting us on pace to achieve our Horizon 1 target of 30% to 35% software growth in our fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2020 time frame.","Our services business had another strong quarter, delivering 5% growth with robust gross margins, resulting from transformation initiatives we\u2019ve been executing to improve an already effective and efficient business.","The scale, scope and expertise of our services team remains a differentiator for us. And with a customer satisfaction rating of 9.6 out of 10 for our technical support team, it is clear we are providing support at levels unmatched in the industry. ","During the quarter, systems also continued to perform as expected with customers choosing our traditional appliances when they want to control and manage the end-to-end application delivery solution and in most high-performance used cases.","At this point, I will hand the call over to Frank to review our Q1 fiscal year 2019 results and our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Frank?","Frank Pelzer","Thank you, Fran\u00e7ois, and good afternoon, everyone.","As Fran\u00e7ois noted, we delivered solid revenue and strong EPS growth in the quarter. First quarter revenue of $544 million was up approximately 4% year-over-year, within our guided range of $542 million to $552 million. GAAP EPS was $2.16 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.70 per share was well above our guidance of $2.51 to $2.54 per share. The beats for GAAP and non-GAAP EPS were driven largely by strong gross margin, hiring that was slightly behind plan and better than expected other income.","Q1 product revenue of $234 million was up 3% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 43% of total revenue. Software was approximately 19% of product revenue and grew 21% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 81% of product revenue and was down less than a percent year-over-year. Services revenue of $310 million grew 5% year-over-year and represented approximately 57% of total revenue.","On a regional basis, in Q1, Americas revenue was flat year-over-year and represented 54% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 27% of overall revenue. This quarter, we've combined our APAC and Japan\u2019s earnings for external reporting to reflect the way we now view the business internally. Revenue for this combined region grew 11% year-over-year and accounted for 19% of total revenue.","Sales to enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales for the quarter. Service providers accounted for 14% and government sales were 21%, including 10% from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had three greater than 10% distributors, Ingram Micro which accounted for 17% of total revenue, and Westcon and Arrow, each of which accounted for 11% of total revenue.","Turning to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 84.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2%, slightly better than our expectations, driven by improving product margins which were benefitting from an increasing mix of software sales as well as continuing strength in our services margins. GAAP operating expenses were $299 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $262 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 29.1%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%, above our guidance of in the mid-30% range, driven largely by gross margin strength and operating expense efficiency. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.5%, in line with our 21% to 22% guidance range.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q1, we generated $198 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.55 billion at quarter-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 54 days, driven by service maintenance renewals at the end of FY18. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $31.6 million. While our adoption of ASC 606 had a de minimis impact on our income statement, we did experience a few changes on our balance sheet items. Deferred revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $1.15 billion. Approximately half of $134.2 million increase over the previous quarter was due to the adoption of 606. Other current and long-term assets increased by $135.5 million from the previous quarter, of which approximately 80% is due to the adoption of 606, as we are now capitalizing on note receivables and commission paid for sales of service contracts. Finally, retained earnings increased by $130.7 million in the quarter, approximately $36 million of which was driven by the adoption of 606.","We ended the quarter with approximately 4,580 employees, up 170 people from Q4 as we execute on our plan to aggressively hire in our growth areas. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 569,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $177.64 per share for a total of $101 million.","Now, let me share our guidance for Q2 \u201819. Unless otherwise stated, please note that all of my comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. Overall, we remain confident in our position in the market and in the growth opportunities for the business with solid software momentum. We believe the long-term trend toward multi-cloud environment is strong and will be a fundamental growth driver for the solutions we offer today and those we will launch in the first half of calendar 2019. While sales to enterprise customers continues to remain strong, we have seen some softness within our service providers vertical as some of our larger customers are planning their next generation application architectures. F5 is positioned very well to capitalize on the massive increase in application traffic anticipated with 5G architectures, but we believe it is prudent to factor in a measure of the near-term softness with our service provider customers in our outlook. Our guidance does not include the impact of the U.S. federal government shutdown, should it extend into February.","With this in mind, we are targeting revenue in the range of $543 million to $553 million. We expect gross margins in the 85% to 85.5% range. We\u2019re estimating operating expenses of $270 million to $282 million. You'll recall that last quarter we mentioned we expected operating margin to move down slightly in Q2 and Q3 before moving into the upper 30% range in Q4.","We anticipate our effective tax rate for the year will remain in the 21% to 22% range we previously provided for the full fiscal year with some fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. Our Q2 earnings target is $2.53 to $2.56 per share. In the quarter, we expect share based compensation expense of approximately $40 million and $1.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. As a reminder, we anticipate stock-based compensation to be in the range of $155 million to $165 million for the year.","Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $110 million to $130 million for the year. This range includes approximately $70 million of costs related to our previously announced move of our corporate headquarters to F5 Tower in Downtown Seattle as we ready the space for occupancy this year.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Fran\u00e7ois. Fran\u00e7ois?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Frank.","Before we move to Q&A, I will spend just a few minutes on the trends we're seeing in the business, highlighting some customer wins from the quarter and talking to innovation at F5.","On January 15th, we released our fifth annual State of Application Services report. With input from nearly 2,000 respondents across a range of industries, company sizes and roles, the report provides a view into applications trend impacting our customers globally. One of the key takeaways from this year\u2019s survey is that as organizations progress on their digital transformation journeys, they see application services as vital for cloud adoption. The report also shows that multi-cloud has evolved from an experiment to a key strategy with nearly 90% of respondents reporting they are implementing multi-cloud architectures. Enforcing consistent security and ensuring reliable performance in these multi-cloud environments remains challenging. These and other trends highlighted in the report align with our vision of expanding F5\u2019s reach and role and with our efforts in the last year to repurpose investment and focus on growth areas for our business.","These trends are also playing out in real time with our customers, and you can see them in some of our customer wins from Q1. These include a win with a global software and service provider customer who was already leveraging F5 solutions across their multi-cloud environments, including a Bring Your Own license in AWS Marketplace and Virtual Editions in Equinix and Azure. This quarter, they purchased licenses for their procurement and supply chain software-as-a-service offering on Google's cloud platform.","Customers, increasingly are making decisions on a per app basis. And during Q1, we had a per app public cloud deployment with a U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange. This customer wanted to differentiate its services to the financial industry through best-in-class security solutions for blockchain transactions.","They chose F5\u2019s Cloud Edition Virtual Web Application Firewall for its more robust performance over native public cloud tools and BIG-IQ for the ability to manage and scale the per app infrastructure.","We also provided a soccer subscription consumption model to match their end user billing cycles. There are two BIG-IP Cloud Edition wins and highlight from the quarter. One with an international stock exchange, and the other with the large energy supplier in Europe. In both cases, customers are using Cloud Edition for application service isolation, enabling agile application development. This includes simplifying the move from a development environment into production across multiple clouds and ensuring policy compliance through self service templates.","We continue to see security use cases driving a significant portion of our customer conversations and net new customer wins. That's not surprising when you consider data from our application services report shows that customers are increasingly deploying a combination of security services to protect their applications and data. Our Advanced Web Application Firewall solution plays right into that trend and our bot detection and mitigation capabilities are a significant differentiator.","During the quarter, we had a number of customers select our Advance WAF solution for its anti-bot and machine generated traffic monitoring and blocking capabilities. This includes a major U.S. city\u2019s police department that needed enhanced features and functionality beyond the native cloud tool set that they have been using.","Turning to service providers. We are driving continued adoption of our NFV solutions in new areas of business with our service provider customers. In Q1, we closed the deals for our DNS offerings with multiple Tier 1s globally. These customers are leveraging the combination of our extreme scale DNS infrastructure along with the ability to protect that infrastructure with our integrated security capabilities.","In addition, we also continue to win 4G and now 5G related deals with our mobile customers, and we see continued strength in firewall use cases including GPRS Tunneling Protocol. We see 2019 as a significant pivot point for our business, a point where our customers will begin to experience a different F5. What do I mean by that? I mean, they will be able to migrate or upgrade their F5 instances in minutes. They will be able to consume F5 technology as a native cloud service without owning F5 hardware or software. They will be able to try and buy F5 technology in new ways. Over the last 18 months, we significantly shifted our investments and resources towards innovation in automation and orchestration, Cloud-Native software and software-as-a-service, and we are excited our customers will experience these new capabilities first hand in 2019.","BIG-IP Cloud Edition was introduced in May and continues to gain traction with customers wanting to consume ADC on a per app basis or wanting to offer better SLAs to their DevOps users. The majority of use cases for BIP-IP Cloud Edition continue to be net new applications we were not addressing before.","As we continue to bring new solutions and new innovations to our customers, F5\u2019s reach and role will continue to evolve. Our development teams continue to drive our Cloud-Native software and F5-as-a-Service platforms forward. These are two disruptive platforms that we are convinced will change the paradigm of application delivery. Both are well on track for first commercial availability in the first half of calendar 2019. And I have to tell you, I\u2019m so proud of these teams. They have moved forward relentlessly and have taken these solutions from paper to reality in an incredibly short period of time.","Both of these offerings are now at beta stage and in the hands of early customers providing feedback on initial features. At the same time, we\u2019re moving full steam ahead with the internal digital transformation required to support our digital touch motions and ensure frictionless procurement and service renewals for our new offerings. It\u2019s a different kind of innovation but innovation nonetheless. We believe that robust and constant innovation is a necessity for F5. So, we\u2019re also innovating in new ways.","For more than a year now, we have teams dedicated to focusing on testing new disruptive innovations in technology, business models or customer segments. Operating under the supervision of Tom Fountain, our Chief Strategy Officer, each team is led by general manager and staff with dedicated employees. We expect innovations will be complementary to our goal of delivering the broadest and most consistent portfolio of app services across cloud and on-premises environment.","During Q1, we announced one of the first innovations to come from this program and the open beta of our Aspen Mesh solution. With the shift from monolithic to micro service architectures, a rapidly increasing number of applications are being deployed in container environments, yet there is still a need for services that help enterprises monitor, manage and control micro service based applications at run time. Aspen Mesh provides critical enterprise features in a platform built on top of Istio, so organizations enjoy the benefits of an open source approach without forgoing the features, support and guarantee needed to power enterprise applications. It\u2019s very early days for this solution, but we've already got customers who are very interested in exploring it. These innovations represent incredible forward movement and speak to the drive and dedication of our global team.","In closing, my thanks to the entire F5 team, our partners and our customers. We are excited about the progress we're making toward our long-term vision for F5. We are expanding our reach and our role, expanding our reach by taking our industry-leading solutions beyond traditional data centers and into private and public clouds, and expanding the role we play for applications by providing additional, high-value services.","With that, we will now open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Sami Badri","Hi. Thank you for the questions. First one to kick it off was just talking about your guidance for 1Q or calendar 1Q coming up, and it does not include any partial government shutdown in past, just as a clarification, I believe I heard that earlier. And then, a second piece of that is, if there is any customer impact so far from the U.S. partial government shutdown? That would be great color.","Frank Pelzer","Sure, Sami. So, it\u2019s Frank. I\u2019ll take that one first. So, to answer the second part of the question first. We have seen an impact, but it's not in probably the way that you might expect. We have actually won business but there's no one in the Central Procurement Agency to actually process the paperwork. And so, our guidance anticipates that this does not go on through the remainder of the quarter, but some of this is actually going to be there to process where we\u2019ll find another route in which to process those orders. If we find that this continues to go throughout the quarter, we probably would expect some impact that is not anticipated in our guidance.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Just to complete that on the question. And no, we have not seen an impact outside of the federal government in our broader enterprise business to-date. ","Sami Badri","And then, my second question has to do with the GAAP services gross margins that continues to expand, and it continues to hit a record high as of this quarter. Can you walk us through what are the dynamics that are driving expansion? Could you potentially attribute the EPS beat in the quarter to both services margin expanding and on top of that the ELA that was reported in the quarter?","Frank Pelzer","Yes. So, the dynamics on the services business, there are essentially two initiatives we've put in place last year that are bearing fruits. Generally, there's a set of transmission initiatives we have in services, but specifically, we\u2019re leveraging more tools and more AI tools and automation to deflect as many cases as possible where we can, and it's allowing us to how better efficiencies, better realization of our resources. We've also embarked on having a better distribution of our resources globally to support different geographies, and both of these efforts are benefitting in our gross margins.","Operator","Thank you. The next questions is from Samik Chatterjee of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Samik Chatterjee","Fran\u00e7ois, I just wanted to start with the Horizon 1 targets that you have, which kind of you alluded to in terms of software growth of 30% to 35% this year. So, clearly, you\u2019re expecting acceleration in the coming quarters. Just want to understand if you expect that to be more driven by the Cloud Edition product that you're ramping up on or is there also contribution kind of that you\u2019re thinking of from the products that are coming up in terms of Cloud-Native apps as well as F5-as-a-Service coming through later this year, how are you thinking about kind of the driver of this acceleration in software this year?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Samik. Yes, we\u2019re expecting an acceleration. Generally, we feel we are on track with this Horizon 1 target. So, for everybody\u2019s benefit, we said in Horizon 1 which is 2019 and 2020, we expected software growth to be in the 30% to 35% range. And we still feel that when you look at these two years in aggregate, that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to be. So, there is going to be an acceleration. The contributors, Samik, in 2019, I do expect Cloud Edition to be a meaningful contributor to that growth. We have seen continued traction with Cloud Edition. We did actually more deals on Cloud Edition just in this past Q1 than we did for all of 2018. So, we are seeing a pick-up there. And I also expect that in 2019, we will see meaningful contributions from our new modes of consumption, specifically, these ELAs, these Enterprise License Agreements and the subscription models which are also gaining traction with our customers. The newer products that will be released in the first half of calendar \u201819, specifically the Cloud-Native app services platform and our F5-as-a-Service, SaaS offering, they will start contributing in 2019, but I would expect that the more meaningful contribution comes in 2020 for these lower propositions. ","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. And I just had a quick follow-up for Frank. Frank, the pace of repurchases moderate over the last -- what we\u2019ve seen as a pace over the last year. Is that something procedural in terms of like blackout period et cetera, or is this more of a reflection of how you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation this year?","Frank Pelzer","I think would just say, capital allocation, not just this year but just broadly how we think about our capital allocation strategy. We think cash is very strategic asset. And for the first time in a long time, we\u2019re actually getting some decent interest rate return on it that we saw a beat on our other income. That's clearly not necessarily where we want to beat. We want to beat on the top-line but we will take it on the operating -- on the other income line as well. I think, share repurchase is one of several alternatives for our cash. Dividends are also a possibility, M&A is also a possibility and several other things. And so, we view this as strategic to the business. And we also believe we\u2019re likely going to be in the 100 million to 150 million range for the quarters to come. So, I think that should be the expectation that you set. It\u2019s what we baked into the guidance that we\u2019ve given.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen. Your line is now open.","Paul Silverstein","If we could just focus on the telecom segment, Fran\u00e7ois, if I\u2019m looking at the numbers correctly, we\u2019d have to go back over five years the last time telecom was as low. It looks like you\u2019ve been around $76 million down from the $100-plus-million that prevailed throughout fiscal \u201818. That's the $30 plus million drop. I know you made some comments during the call but I was hoping you could give us some more insight in terms of what is going on in that segment and your expectations going forward?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","So, generally, we had a soft quarter on service providers in Q1, and we actually expect the softness to prolong for a couple of quarters. The softness was particularly marked more in North America than globally. And I would say that generally what we're seeing is we\u2019re in a bit of a transition between 4G and 5G where we had a number of projects -- 4G related projects that are kind of tailing off, and 5G related projects that haven't yet picked-up. We feel pretty good about our position for 5G because as 5G radios get deployed, we are going to be in line of that traffic. So, we expect to see potentially significant capacity upgrades down the road as that 5G traffic starts hitting the GI core. But, that's not in place yet, and we think we are seeing a bit of a transition from one to the other, and we\u2019re in between.","We also saw a couple of projects that we won in quarter that were pushed out that we think will pick up in the next quarter. But, if you look at the broader trend, which we also saw last quarter -- by the way, we\u2019re soft in service providers in Q1 -- sorry, in our Q4, that is kind of a similar trend we\u2019re seeing, this is transition between 4G and 5G.","Paul Silverstein","Fran\u00e7ois, just to be clear, I understand it's hard to -- in situations like this, it\u2019s hard to project or forecast. But, given the magnitude of the softness where again from the $100 million, $110 million quarterly run rate that has prevailed for the past three years, this dramatic fall off, is this -- do you have visibility that this is primarily or just a function of a 4G to 5G transition? How much of this is true insight, how much of this is speculation?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","I would hope more of it is insight. I generally think we are experiencing -- we are already in the middle of this transition. Paul, of course, there are always areas you can look out and say look, there are areas where in terms of go-to-market we can execute better. In fact, we are in the process of hiring on the frontend of our business. In one area where we are actually doing significant hiring is in the service provider space, both in North America and internationally, because we see strong opportunity. We think that architecturally we are well-positioned. We\u2019ve brought in a new GM, as you know, James Feger a few months back, and we\u2019re getting a lot of clarity around some of the future developments we\u2019re going to make. So, generally, I feel good about where our service provider business is going to go. But, I do think the softness we\u2019re seeing is not going to go away in just a quarter or two. I think we're going to see that for few quarters.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Kurtz of Key Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Alex Kurtz","Yes. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just on the ELA outlook. Can you just kind of reset for us how long the enterprise sales organization has been talking to your top enterprise accounts about ELAs? And what\u2019s your multiyear outlook for ELAs as far as adoption within your enterprise accounts, your service provider accounts, and kind of what it\u2019s done maybe to deal size, share wins? Any kind of qualitative, quantitative feedback? How long it\u2019s been in the system for the sales organization and kind of what outcomes you\u2019re seeing from it?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thanks, Alex. I'll start and then I will ask Chad Whalen to add in terms of the pick-up with the sales team. Last year, we introduced the ELAs just last year; and really in 2018 we\u2019re essentially experimenting with the sales motion. We\u2019ve now launched it as of November to our sales team and we\u2019re seeing significant excitement and traction with it. In terms of your question around the multiyear outlook for ELAs, I would say we expect over time in our Horizon 2 for a meaningful portion of our software business, if not the majority of the time to be ELA or subscription based. And we will see that we believe both in the enterprise base and to some extent in the service provider -- in the service provider space. So, it is a meaningful and important development for us. It gives our customers a lot more flexibility around where they deploy their licenses. And when they have uncertainty around the lifecycle of an application or the amount of capacity they\u2019ll need for some application, it's a great vehicle for them to deal with that uncertainty, and it also allows them to consume much faster because they don\u2019t have to deal with multiple procurement cycles. So, for the first ELAs that we have signed, we\u2019re actually seeing a good opportunity to expand on those ELAs when we renew them sometimes in 2019.","Alex Kurtz","And just to clarify, every account exec can quote out ELA or is it just in certain pods and certain verticals?","Chad Whalen","Yes. Hi, Alex. This is Chad Whalen. Yes, every account exec can and does quote out ELA. And in fact, we just launched an aggressive incentive campaign for all of them. And that's really driven appreciable increase to the pipeline of opportunities. At the end of the day, our customers are really embracing this vehicle because it\u2019s an easy commercial construct to consume our services in any kind of mode that they want across the different application suites. Whether it's on-prem or in the cloud, it\u2019s a great vehicle that can take away some of the complexity as they\u2019re going through these digital transformations. In terms of the adoption from our sales team, it takes time to get the motion right in the market, understanding how to size it from a customer perspective and take friction out of that process. What we're seeing now after we\u2019ve spent the time that Fran\u00e7ois talked about in terms of pressure testing and learning last year, we are getting a lot more velocity in the motion and we are seeing that translate into the pipeline of opportunities now and in the future quarters.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","When you mentioned about your Cloud-Native solutions without having to buy F5 hardware, could you walk us through such transactions and specifically some economics of it, dollar amount, gross margins or just generally how we should think about that and the premise if this continues increase? Is there any way for us to frame about the detriment to the hardware and the uptick on the software and the impact to margins and dollars?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Let's start with margins. As you know, our gross margins in hardware are in the early 80s and our gross margins on Cloud-Native software by -- bought as package software are going to be in the early 90s. So, there is not a huge difference. We said in our guidance that in our Horizon 2, which was 2021, 2022, we potentially would see a bit of an uptick in gross margin. We\u2019re in the 85% range now and we would be in the 85% to 87% range in that horizon. As it relates to the price or the top-line impact of it, the equitation is actually fairly simple for us. The hardware today, primarily what our customers consume today before introduction of our Cloud Edition was hardware and Virtual Editions. These have been largely consumed on-prem, though we have a very rapid growth now happening in the cloud. The new package software products that we are releasing, the Cloud Edition that came out last year and this Cloud-Native Application Services platform that's coming out in the first half of \u201819, those are opening up new use cases and allowing us to address applications that we have not addressed in the past that would characterize as the longer tail of applications. The price per unit for each of those applications is going to be less than when you are buying a big unit of hardware, of course, but the volume of applications we can address is much greater. And so, we look at it as an extension of our addressable market. And we think that largely these new platforms address an incremental market and an incremental opportunity for us.","Operator","Next question is from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Simon Leopold","I wanted to come back to the topic of capital allocation. The Company up until this most recent quarter has been pretty steadily buying back at least 150 million. And then with the renewal, you updated [technical difficulty] additional billion. I wanted to see if we can better understanding of the Board's logic and your logic for why wouldn\u2019t you institute a dividend of perhaps a 3% or 4% yield. That can give you some wiggle room of maybe 75 million to 100 million per quarter, if you go to a dividend and be attractive to our larger set of shareholders. Could you help us understand that?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes, Simon. Look, I will bring you back Simon to what we said at our Analyst Investor Meeting in March. We are pursuing a growth strategy and we laid out what we think the financials are of that growth strategy. And part of that we said is we want to use our cash as a strategic asset to pursue that growth, some of which could be used potentially for acquisitions. And so, we want to have that flexibility if we see opportunities in the market to accelerate our growth or de-risk part of our plan to take the opportunity and use our cash, the strategic asset to do that. And we don\u2019t want to lose that flexibility because that\u2019s the strategy we\u2019re pursuing. ","Simon Leopold","And could you just maybe outline your acquisition philosophy in terms of what type or size of deals would you be biased towards technology tuck-in or larger deals that might require the Company actually take on debt? ","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Simon, here is what I would share with you about our philosophy as it relates to acquisitions. We feel that we have a significant opportunity to extend our reach in terms of being able to reach every application anywhere. We think the world is becoming more application centric. We believe our growth is going to be linked to applications. And we want to reach every application anywhere. In addition to that, we offer a number of app services today. And we believe we have an opportunity because of our position to offer more application services and extend our role. We will look at acquisitions that allow us to accelerate the expansion of our reach or the expansion of our role. And when you look at it within the context, we may look at things that are what you would call tuck-ins or even acqui hires or small acquisition and-or there may be opportunities for things that are bigger. We\u2019re not constrained and we\u2019re not looking at it just in terms of is it small or big. We\u2019re really looking at it in terms of, is there a strategic fit. The most important thing for me, as we go through and potentially explore these opportunities, is to make sure that we remain disciplined about it, disciplined in terms of course being continuing to focus on organic innovation as our first priority and discipline in making sure that if and when we make an acquisition that we have truly thought through how we create value from having the asset inside of F5 as opposed to outside. And as a result of that we have a very strong value creation plan through a transaction.","Operator","The next question is from Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is now open.","Jason Ader","I have two questions. First, can you comment on the federal strength? It looks like that grew about 30% year-over-year and love to get any comments on what's happening there. And then, secondly, Fran\u00e7ois, could you remind us the difference between the Cloud Edition and the upcoming Cloud-Native app services platform just so we can kind of level set the differentiation there?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","I will take the first question and Kara will take the second one. We generally have a strong fourth quarter on federal. So, we have a good quarter there. We saw specific traction in security in that space, and specifically with our SSL orchestration solution. So, we announced in 2018 that we were coming to market with new solutions to provide encryption, decryption of SSL traffic and build the chain services for security stack inside of large enterprise customers. We\u2019re seeing traction actually across the enterprise base for this, we\u2019re very excited about the pipeline we have for these solution. And our federal team was early off the blocks with the solution. And as a result, we had a pretty strong quarter there.","Kara Sprague","And with regard to your question about the difference between Cloud Edition and our Cloud-Native Application Services, I'll call out a few of the distinctions. Our Cloud Edition is based on our industry-leading BIG-IP application delivery controller platform. And so, what that is, is effectively our virtual addition, which is license and a per app model to allow for isolation of services for those application services with our BIG-IQ centralized manager solution. And that enables a whole bunch of new used cases for our customers including things like operating dedicated instances for each of their applications, so it\u2019s the per app model, as well as application trouble shooting such that application developers no longer have to go through tedious ticketing processes to get things examined in terms if applications go down.","Another component of the Cloud Edition is that something that is really targeted for our customers that have already invested heavily in our BIG-IP platform and want to extend the reach of that platform to more applications in their environment. Now, in contrast the Cloud-Native Application Services will be a pure software-based solution; it will be only available as a software subscription; and that will be targeted to more of a developer and a DevOps audience and is intended to provide very easy-to-use, very intuitive insertion of application services into applications at the time of the application inception, which means that it will come out with very strong integration into CI and CD pipeline. ","Operator","The next question is from Tal Liani of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Tal Liani","I wanted to discuss the slowdown you discussed in the prepared remarks. I still don\u2019t understand if the slowdown is -- it's more limited to just service providers, telecom service providers, kind of slowing down purchases? And then, why is it there just there and\/or the government and what about the general enterprise, what do you see in the general enterprise? I'm trying to understand if also during the quarter, if you noticed the slowdown throughout the quarter or it deteriorated kind of what was the seasonality within the quarter?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","So, let's take the three segments that you brought up. So, no, in the federal space, we did not see a slowdown. Frank mentioned to you the situation we have right now where we have one business that cannot be processed but we hope this resolves itself over the next few weeks. So, no change in the federal government space.","Largely in the enterprise, if I look at it globally, I would also say that generally there has been no change in buying behavior. We do hear from our customers that they are watching the microenvironment and being a bit cautious about their future plans. But that potential cautiousness hasn\u2019t translated yet into any change in buying behavior as being general enterprise space across the globe.","In the service provider space, as I said, it was a -- I believe the transition we\u2019re seeing between 4G and 5G and specifics to what we are seeing in terms of projects tailing off and net new projects haven\u2019t really picked up yet. There wasn\u2019t a particular linearity. As we know, the service provider business can be quite lumpy. So, there wasn\u2019t a particular linearity in the quarter associated with that.","Tal Liani","Now 5G has a lot of edge data centers, how do you participate in edge data centers? Is it playing to your strength or is it going to be more generic solutions from other vendors?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","So, we participate potentially in several ways in 5G but the first way is we\u2019re in line of a lot of the core traffic for mobile service providers. And 5G, really those are going to bring more traffic on to this core. And so, we expect to see capacity upgrades, as a result of these deployments. When the architectures evolve to a different 5G core and not every service provider will go through a 5G core but when the architectures evolve to that, I think we will have an opportunity to expand our role, and we will get into that in future calls. But, generally, we see ourselves having a probably an expanded role in 5G from what we have to-date.","Tal Liani","So, far we discussed just the demand side, not the supply side, just the customers and verticals. What about the supply side, what about your portfolio, what are the plans for 2019 in terms of product launches and things that are coming out to the market, and what do you think is going to -- could have the potential of changing the growth trajectory, more materially than other things?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Your question Tal is specific to service providers... ","Tal Liani","No. My question is more general. We spoke about the demand based on verticals. But now, my question is about the supply, meaning your product portfolio changes your planning for 2019. Could you just give us kind of an outlook given that we\u2019re at the beginning of the year, changes your paying for 2019, things that you think could be material more material than other things you're offering, et cetera? ","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes. So, a couple of things, Tal. The first thing, if we\u2019re looking at it in the context of 2019 are actually products and solutions that we\u2019ve brought to market in the six months that are going to ramp up through the year. And I would point to three. One is, our Advanced Web Applications Firewall gaining a lot of traction. We had actually a very strong security quarter. We are specifically -- as you know bot defense has become a very important theme for both service providers and enterprises. And our performance and differentiation on bot is unique and we believe unmatched in the industry. That\u2019s one and that\u2019s -- we offer that on our Advanced WAF today. And we\u2019re bringing more features and products around bot defense throughout the year. Second is Cloud Edition, I\u2019ve talked about that. That will also continue to ramp throughout the year. And third is the new security offering around SSL orchestration. We had that offering in the past but it was an offering that required significant involvement of professional services. We just released the solution that can be deployed much faster and much easier by our customers and we\u2019re seeing enormous traction with our solution.","So I expect all of these things to contribute to 2019. I expect our NFV operating that we also released in the fourth quarter of 2018 to contribute to our numbers in the service provider space in 2019. And then we\u2019re going to release new products that I talked about, in the first half of 2019, which will start to contribute but again will have a bigger in 2020. When you work at it in aggregate, to use your term, Tal, on the supply side, I think we have an exciting pipeline of products and offerings that are going to contribute to the top line going forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Catharine Trebnick of Dougherty. Your line is now open.","Catharine Trebnick","Can you talk a little bit about Avi Networks? Four or five -- five years ago, we always heard A10 nipping at your heels. And the last six months, the buzz on Avi has picked-up. And can you tell us maybe or quantify the number -- types of use cases that you run-up against then, and then what's your strategy to outflank them?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","So, specifically, so, we\u2019re dismissive of any of our competitor, however small they may be. And so, in the case of Avi, we don\u2019t see them that often. When we do see them we actually like our win rate. And that's -- we probably haven't seen them as much because we haven't played in the long tail of applications as much as we are going to be playing in the long tail of applications in 2019. And as I mentioned earlier, both on our Cloud Edition and the Cloud-Native App Services platform that Kara described, we\u2019re bringing to the market a per app consumption model as well as really lightweight, nimble, Cloud-Native combined with our overall capabilities and service and support and scale, and a heritage of two decades of supporting mission-critical applications for our customers. And we don\u2019t think anybody is going to match that anytime soon. And so, we actually feel very confident about competing with them, when we see them, because again, it's frankly not a very frequent occurrence. ","Operator","The next question is from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Rod Hall","You mentioned earlier, I think, Fran\u00e7ois, that you guys at least want to reserve some capital for acquisitions or maybe that's part of that capital plan. I'm just wonder could you talk a little bit about technology areas where you would like to expand the business in places where you think you may have deficiencies or are you thinking more something aimed at the core of the business? I mean, just kind of help us understand without giving us I guess too much, what sorts of areas you might be interested in. And then, I have a follow-up.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes, Rod. So, this one is difficult one, as you can imagine. I would tell you, if you look at our expansion of reach and role, you will see that expanding our reach revolves more around software and cloud; and expanding our role revolves more around other application services that we might want to offer. And so, those would be, if you think about the horizon and the way we look at world and the filters we use, those are the filters that I would give you today for what we might do if in fact we find something that is of interest to us.","Rod Hall","Can you say which of those two reach or role is more strategically important?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Both are.","Rod Hall","Okay. And then, just a housekeeping question. Do you have a minimum cash balance that you guys feel like you need to run the business?","Frank Pelzer","Rod, I think we generally think of probably in the $400 million to $500 million range.","Rod Hall","Okay. If you\u2019re kind of there, Frank, is that right?","Frank Pelzer","I\u2019m sorry. What do you mean there? We certainly have got more than our minimum. Yes, we\u2019ve got 1.55 billion.","Rod Hall","Okay, of your total cash and investment, so you can run that down to 400 or 500 comfortably; below that you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable?","Frank Pelzer","That\u2019s right.","Operator","Thank you, Rod.

Thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll talk briefly to our business drivers before handing over to Frank to review the quarter\u2019s results in detail. Customer demand for consistent application security and reliable application performance across multi-cloud environments drove 5% total revenue growth in our fourth quarter. Strong customer demand for security use cases including web application firewall and identity of our proxy as well as continue the ELA traction fueled our second consecutive quarter of 91% software growth and drove overall product revenue growth of 3%.","F5\u2019s application services are making it possible for enterprises and service providers across the globe to deliver digital experiences with the reliability and speed their end customers expect. Our software growth was partially offset by our systems business, which was down 13% as customers increasingly look to consume F5 services and software. Our services business delivered a strong 6% revenue growth and continues to produce robust gross margin with consistently strong attach rates.","I will speak more to our business dynamics later in my remarks. Overall, we are pleased by the acceleration in our transition to more of a software driven business and the team is executing very well that gives our long-term strategy. Frank?","Frank Pelzer","Thank you, Fran\u00e7ois, and good afternoon, everyone. As Fran\u00e7ois noted, we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth. I\u2019ll speak first to our fourth quarter and then to our fiscal year results. Q4 was our first full quarter with NGINX. NGINX\u2019s contribution is fully integrated into our results.","Fourth quarter revenue of $590.4 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year and above the top end of our guided range of $577 million to $587 million. GAAP net income for the quarter was $94.8 million or $1.57 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $156.7 million or $2.59 per share also above the top end of our guidance range.","Q4 product revenue of $265 million was up 3% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 45% of total revenue. As Fran\u00e7ois mentioned, software grew 91% year-over-year for the second consecutive quarter. Software represented approximately 31% of product revenue in Q4, up from approximately 27% in Q3 and from 17% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience strong uptake on our software solutions sold as ELAs and annual subscriptions. The contribution from ELAs was up quarter-over-quarter and up substantially year-over-year.","I will take a moment to elaborate on the impact of the implementation of 606, which was a source of some discussion with investors last quarter. Let me give you the punchline though, which is that the adoption of 606 hardly impacted our year-over-year software revenue growth in Q4. Let me explain why. Under the modified retrospective approach to ASC 606, we are required to compare our 606 Q4 2019 results to what they would have been under 605. In Q4, we estimate the implementation of 606 had a similar impact to Q3. The 606 to 605 comparison is not meaningful for a measuring our software growth, because nearly all of our 2018 revenue came from perpetual licenses or other consumption models not impacted by 606.","In the year ago quarter had 606 been in effect, the net impact to the software revenue would have been de minimis slightly more than $100,000, which means our Q4 software growth rate using 606 and FY2019 compared to FY2018 would have been approximately 90%, said differently, our software revenue growth is being driven by new offerings and new consumption models and not an acceleration of an existing run rate of subscription revenue.","Moving on, systems revenue of $182 million made up approximately 69% of product revenue and was down 15% year-over-year, as customers continue to accelerate their transition to software based solutions. Services revenue of $325 million grew 6% year-over-year and represented approximately 55% of total revenue.","On a regional basis, in Q4, America\u2019s revenue delivered an exceptionally strong quarter with the 11% revenue growth year-over-year and represented 59% of total revenue. EMEA was down 3% and accounted for 23% of revenue, while APAC was down 2% and accounted for 18% of revenue.","Looking at our bookings by vertical, enterprise customers represented 61% of product bookings and service providers accounted for 17%. Our government business was very strong representing 22% of product bookings, including 13% from U.S. Federal. In Q4, we had three greater than 10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which accounted for 18% of total revenue and Carahsoft and Tech Data, each of which accounted for 10%.","Let\u2019s now discuss our FY Q4 2019 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 84.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 86.3%. GAAP operating expenses were $385 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $317 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were higher than our expectations as a result of the higher sales commissions related to software sales. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 19.4% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 32.6%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20%.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4 we generated $206 million in cash flow from operations, up slightly from last year. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.3 billion at quarter end. DSO was 49 days and capital expenditures for the quarter were $21 million, down sequentially as we completed the final phases of building out our new Downtown Seattle facility. Deferred revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $1.2 billion less than half the increase over the prior year quarter relates to the adoption of 606.","We ended the quarter with approximately 5,325 employees, up approximately 130 employees from Q3 reflecting our continued investment in growth areas including sales and research and development. In Q4 we did not repurchase any of our common stock. We continue to view cash as a strategic asset for our future growth. So our primary focus with cash generation is augmenting our strong balance sheet and building a war chest for strategic purposes, we may opt to repurchase shares during any open trading window.","Let\u2019s briefly discuss our fiscal year results. For the full year total revenue grew 4% to $2.24 billion. Product revenue of $986 million grew 3% from the prior year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Within product revenue software grew 60%, while systems revenue declined 8%. Services revenue of $1.26 billion grew approximately 5% during the year and represented 56% of total revenue. GAAP net income for FY2019 was $427.7 million or $7.8 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $626.3 million or $10.36 per share. For FY2019 cash flow from operations totaled $748 million down $13 million from FY2018 largely as a result of the NGINX acquisition. Capital expenditures were $104 million.","Now let me share our guidance for fiscal Q1 of 2020. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. We continue to make strong progress transitioning our business to a software-driven model. We confident in our position in the market and expect our growth will be driven by the growth of applications and increasing demand for our multi-cloud application services.","We also expect continued strong demand for our software solutions add subscription and ELA offerings. With this in mind, we are targeting Q1 2020 revenue in the range of $560 million to $570 million. We expect gross margins of approximately 86%. We estimate operating expenses of $296 million to $308 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for Q1 will remain in the 21% to 22% range. Our Q1 earnings target is $2.41 to $2.44 per share. In the quarter, we expect share-based compensation expense of approximately $46 million and $4.6 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","Finally, as has been our practice, we want to provide you with a high level fiscal 2020 modeling assumptions. First, we are tracking to our Horizon 1 outlook for mid single digit total revenue growth and anticipate a continuation of the trend we saw in the second half of the FY2019 with customers accelerating the transition of their applications to software-based solutions. On FY2020 operating metrics, we anticipate gross margins of approximately 86% for the year.","Following our typical seasonal pattern, we would expect operating margins to move down in Q2 from Q1 and then increase in the second half with full year results within the Horizon 1 range of 33% to 35%. We expect FY2020 stock-based compensation in the range of $185 million to $195 million and capital expenditures in the range of $50 million to $70 million. We expect to update our Horizon 2 outlook at our next Analyst and Investor Day, which we have scheduled for March 3, 2020 in New York. Details will follow as we get closer to the date.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Fran\u00e7ois. Fran\u00e7ois?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Frank. I will speak to some of the business trends we are seeing, highlight some customer wins in the quarter and speak to why we think we are well positioned to capitalize on sky rocketing application growth before moving to Q&A.","But first, I want to highlight the partner news we announced today with Amazon Web Services. We have signed a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS. The agreement outlines specific areas of collaboration across our field sales, solution architecture and professional services team. F5 will now have dedicated AWS solutions architect and professional services resources trained on F5\u2019s technical architecture and our application services across all product lines and geographic theaters. They will be designing F5 into their solutions for existing and new cloud native customers.","Additionally, we have agreed to jointly collaborate on new offerings integrating F5 application services with AWS services Control Tower, CloudFront and other core offerings. We expect this will result in improved customer experience for those customers extending their existing workloads to AWS and for new cloud native applications being deployed in public cloud. We are excited with this next step in our partnership with AWS. For our joint customers, our collaboration will reduce the complexities of securing their assets with a consistent security posture and policy management in hybrid cloud deployments.","Now let me turn to the fourth quarter and the tremendous progress we are making in transforming F5\u2019s business and driving software revenue growth. Last quarter, we said that from our customer\u2019s perspective, it is clear that F5 has moved beyond a traditional ADC player. This quarter\u2019s results provide another data point of our progress and highlight the fact that F5 is emerging as a leader in a rapidly expanding in multi-cloud application services space.","Our customers increasingly want to consume more of F5 services on software and to securely deploy application faster. We have taken a number of steps to unlock this market demand. First, we have created new consumption models, making F5 services available in subscription and ELAs. In doing so, we are reducing friction for both enterprise and service provider customers and sharing easier software provisioning and reducing operating complexity.","As Frank mentioned, we continue to see strong subscription and ELA traction in Q4. In some cases, we are seeing opportunities to expand our revenue opportunity with customers with whom we have already secured an ELA. For instance, last quarter, we mentioned we had closed an ELA with a large next-generation mobile carrier in APAC, where our 5G-ready NFV solutions would address their growing 4G mobile broadband consumer services. I am pleased to announce today that the customer is Rakuten, and during Q4, we secured a second all software use case with them for Gi firewall.","Second, we are enabling more automation and orchestration on our platforms to enable faster application provisioning. In a real world example of customer impact, we are providing one of the world\u2019s leading converged video broadband and communication companies. It cloud based disaster recovery solution for their mission critical entertainment back office support service. In the case of high failure, a disaster recovery solution is activated replicating the customer\u2019s back office support service in AWS.","F5 BIG-IQ, the central management solution for BIG-IP provides the functionality to automatically start F5\u2019s BIG-IP Virtual edition in AWS, when needed. It also provides application and performance visibility of the activated disaster recovery system. In addition, BIG-IQ is providing on-demand licenses for the BIG-IP Virtual editions, which are being consumed under an ELA to ensure cost effective consumption based licensing for the disaster recovery infrastructure.","Third, with NGINX, we are enabling application services consumption in native container environment. As an example, during Q4, we secured a joint F5 NGINX win with an EMEA based financial tech customer. This customer was an existing F5 customer and also a longtime user of NGINX open-source for application services in their microservices environments.","The customer development team had built functionality on top of NGINX as open-source edition to achieve the level of functionality their business demanded. As the scaled, however, this do it yourself approach became difficult to manage. The combine F5 and NGINX team works together to demonstrate that standardizing on NGINX Plus with software support would deliver better value for the customers development and operations teams.","Fourth, we are expanding all our security offerings to software form factors. We continue to see strength in our software security business, as customers tap into the efficiency and scale of the public cloud while utilizing F5 to secure their applications and maximize availability. During Q4, for instance, a large credit union with well over 1 million members chose F5 to protect their apps as they expand to the public cloud.","The customer wanted the efficiency of the cloud along with a consistent set of application protection policies that matched their on-premise security. They are fully integrating the F5 solution into a CI\/CD pipeline, utilizing the F5 automation tool chain, BIG-IQ and advanced security features in our web application firewall.","First and finally, we also are providing solutions specific to the software consumption needs of our service provider customers. In a Q4 win, with an EMEA based service provider, for instance, we sold virtual Gi LAN capacity expansions with VNF Manager in a win that included systems, software, NFV and professional services.","As a result of these actions and our customers\u2019 ability to operationalize and manage virtual infrastructures, we are also experiencing changes in our systems business. What I would ask that you keep in mind as we work our way through this model transition is that F5 is different from traditional hardware data center vendors. Our value proposition is and always has been in our software and application fluency.","As a result, the value we bring to our customers is not tied to the data center, rather it moves with the application. So as we continue to take steps to untether our software from proper sale hardware, we are capturing growth in new forms of consumption of our applications services. While we believe software use case are, and we\u2019ll remain top of mind for customers, we do see systems demand in certain high-performance use cases. With customers\u2019 that wants to control and manage end-to-end application delivery in certain key customer segments and in some emerging geographies.","As an example, during Q4, we worked with a state-owned real estate company in APAC that was looking to refresh F5 solutions that were approaching the end of support. We initially viewed these simple systems refresh opportunity. However, we learned the customer was also looking to enhance and improve the current web solution.","They were also planning an upgrade to comply with the application infrastructure architecture standard, had issues with their single sign on solution and suffered from an inefficient security chain. We won the deal with a systems based solution that combined our local traffic manager with our Application Security Manager, SSL Orchestration and Access Policy Manager.","Before I move on from Q4, let me also provide a brief update on NGINX. In our first full quarter, as a united F5 NGINX team, we continue to drive our value creation plan at a rapid pace. Our first combined solution, the controller that builds on the already successful NGINX controller with enhanced enterprise class features is on plan for release the end of January 2020.","We expect this converge solution will be an accelerator for NGINX business, expanding both the addressable market and potential deal sizes by spending a broader set of use cases across DevOps and Super-NetOps customer personas.","F5 and NGINX sales teams are coming together well with tighter go-to-market teamwork and collaboration which we expect will only accelerate in 2020. I will spend just a few minutes speaking to how we see our opportunity unfolding in fiscal year 2020 and beyond, before we move to Q&A. We are focused on expanding our leadership in multi-cloud application services. On driving continued software growth on BIG-IP Virtual Edition as well as on NGINX and our Cloud Services SaaS platform. At the same time, we are working to forge new world\u2019s go-to-market capabilities, to expand our reach to DevOps, to strengthen enterprise competences on supporting and growing a subscription business and to scale our public cloud partnerships. And we believe the size of our opportunity is growing.","On our March, 2018 Analyst and Investor Day, we said F5 growth opportunity was intrinsically linked to global application growth. IDC estimates that were more than 314 million enterprise application workloads globally in 2018, and forecast that number will grow to approximately 1.8 billion by 2023. At the same, time the number of applications is growing nearly 5x the complexity of deploying, managing and securing these applications is increasing.","Enterprises are embracing new, highly distributed architectures and multi-cloud environments. Simultaneously, the risk of cyber attacks and security threats is increasing with the majority of threats targeting applications or the identity of the person accessing that application. This set of challenges is F5\u2019s opportunity. In an increasingly fast-moving and complex environment, we are in a unique position to actually reduce the complexity of deploying applications across multi-cloud environments, to help our customers to develop, deploy, and scale their business driving applications significantly faster with substantial cost savings on the infrastructure required to support, manage and secure those applications. Perhaps most importantly, we are approaching this challenge with a customer focused mindset.","Let me elaborate. Over the course of 2019, I have had the opportunity to talk to customers around the globe that managed their application capital well, a strategic asset similar to how we manage physical and human capital. They all shared two common attributes. They consistently deliver a higher volume and faster velocity of code to user. What do I mean by that? Developers are core to building applications. They write the code that is the foundation of application, the business logic, backend component and customer facing interfaces.","However, building a great application is only half the journey. The other half is delivering that application, that code all the way to the mobile device, machine or browser that a NAND customer uses to access the application. The world\u2019s most competitive companies have mastered how to push code from development into production with velocity at high volume. They do it in minute. Good companies do it in days. For most, however, it still takes weeks and F5 can change that.","For example, we recently helped a large banking customer reduce the amount of time it takes to deliver code to users from 23 days down to just six minutes. With F5 solution, this customer is driving new revenue generating services and powering developers to be more productive and saving time and money on the infrastructure needed to support their application capital. Our customers can achieve results like this because we deliver the most comprehensive set of technologies and services available and we remove friction from the code to user delivery chain.","So how is this different from other approaches? Most vendors are trying to particularly integrate application services by tightly coupling the infrastructure and a siloed set of application services. We believe application services need to be infrastructure agnostic spanning from code to user. Ours is the only portfolio of application services that stretches horizontally from the servers that how develop a code all the way out to the devices that our customers use.","In other words, we are abstracting the application services from the infrastructure and making it possible for our customers applications to run anywhere, cloud, container, legacy with access to a consistent set of application services. We believe this horizontal approach better serve our customers and provide a sustainable differentiation in the market. During Q4, we shared this vision with more than 75 of our most important customers and 90 of our key partners at Aspire, our premier customer engagement forum hosted in Seattle.","The event brought 550 attendees to our new customer engagement center, including customers from every theater and every industry. The benefit of abstracting application services from network infrastructure resonated very well with attendees, who received custom demos and tailored sessions showing how F5 can help them move faster and more cost effectively. The reaction was very positive, and we\u2019re looking forward to sharing this perspective with all of our customers in 2020.","In summary, we are entering 2020 in a position of strength. We built on our market leading ADC and security portfolio with BIG-IP, NGINX, F5 Cloud Services, Silverline and other investment, and continue to add new application services. We have added technologies that either provide or power app servers, Web servers, container networking, API solutions, DNS, distributed denial-of-service capabilities and content delivery networks. We are leveraging best-in-class application management and security services, a sticky base of thousands of enterprise customers, and real-time intelligence and action. And we will continue to enhance our ability to meet applications wherever they are, to simplify multi-cloud complexity for our customers and to expand the breadth of our application services, including expanding security services across all our platforms.","In closing, my thanks to the entire F5 team for driving a great quarter and year. Your grit, determination and flexibility is behind a significant transformation of our business that we believe will bring long-term returns to our customers and shareholders. My thanks also to our partners, our customers, and our shareholders for joining us on our journey.","With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from at Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Sami Badri","Hi, thank you. So you commented on the strength of software and the dynamics to expect in 2020. Just to give us a little bit more of an idea on how we should be modeling systems growth. Would you say that the dynamics and the growth rates that we\u2019ve seen in the last two quarters in systems growth should all be \u2013 should also be extended through FY2020, with the software dynamics maintained?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Sami. Thanks for the question. So what you saw in the second half of 2020 is a acceleration in the decline of the systems business and also a very significant acceleration in our software business. I think that, that dynamic generally is going to continue in 2020, so relative to what we would have expected a year ago. We think we are ahead of plan on our transition, and that the \u2013 the software growth is going to be higher than what we thought and the systems decline is also going to be faster than what we would have thought in the past. That\u2019s driven by a combination of things. On the one hand, customers, we\u2019re seeing customers that have matured in their ability to consume application services and software.","So a number of customers have software first policies, have policies to leverage multi-cloud. They have more operational maturity around virtualization. And we seeing that both in enterprise and the service providers segment now. So there\u2019s a demand pull from the market. And there are also a number of things that we have done to accelerate that transition by enabling customers to consume our BIG-IP software in new consumption format, specifically subscriptions, enterprise license agreement, a lot of work with public cloud marketplaces.","We\u2019ve done things like automation and orchestration that allow them to deploy applications faster in software. We\u2019ve put a lot of our software in security and software consumption factors. And we\u2019ve also done a lot of work to help service providers move to software. So when you combine a lot of the things that we have done as well as the demand from the market, you\u2019re going to see that trend continue. And for us, it\u2019s good because we feel that our strategic thesis is intact and we are ahead of our plan on our transition.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you for the color on that. And then the second question I had is, if you were to categorize the movements or I guess you could say the growth and strength in software and systems across your customer types across enterprise, SPs and government. Which one of these buckets is accelerating the systems decline versus which one of these buckets is actually accelerating the software adoption growth? Right. Just so we can get an idea on which customers are driving these changes?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","I think all three have \u2013 Sami, I think all three have both trend to a degree. But I\u2019ll take them separately. So in the enterprise, I think that the transition towards software started in the enterprise earlier than the other two segments that you mentioned. And that trend is only accelerating for the reasons I mentioned around operational maturity, ability to operationalize, virtualization technologies and also the freedom of consumption that we have given them.","In the service providers segment, I would say it\u2019s only in the last couple of quarters that we \u2013 our customers have spoken about NFV for a number of years, but we are now seeing them really start to implement these virtualization technologies. In part, with in combination with 5G or in getting ready for 5G architectures, we\u2019re seeing more of our service provider customers adopt software architectures. I mentioned in the script, one of the customers we won Rakuten, which is who are building essentially a Telco, a next-gen Telco infrastructure that\u2019s 100% virtual. And so there, I think at one end of the spectrum what we\u2019re seeing a number of carriers move in that direction. And then I would say in the government, the transition is also happening but at a slower pace relative to the other two segments.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you. And then my last question for you is regarding the cash pile and war chest. So could you just give us an idea on specifically what you\u2019re looking for? You mentioned that the security offerings are not going to be following software form factors. Is that where you\u2019re going to spend the majority of your time to consider bolstering the business or using the war chest? Or could you just give us a better idea on what exactly you\u2019re looking for as opportunities?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","No. Sami, I would \u2013 the way I\u2019d characterize it for you is, we want to become the best application services platform in the industry. And I think the way to look at it is, if you look at everything that exists between an application and the user of that application, there is a set of services that are in that chain that includes things like load balancing and security and firewalls and app servers and web servers. We have significantly broadened our presence in the code to customer chain with the acquisition of NGINX. And our strategy is essentially to own that horizontal chain and provide the best application services that enhance this customer experience for users of an application.","And so when we look at \u2013 and that\u2019s kind of different than others who are perhaps pursuing more of a vertical approach where there are tied to a single siloed of infrastructure. We want to be 100% infrastructure agnostic, enable those application services for any app anywhere, regardless of how it\u2019s built and regardless of where it\u2019s deployed. And so in the context of that horizontal strategy we\u2019re looking at opportunities to broaden our portfolio organically or inorganically anywhere in that chain from code to customer. So security is of course an important component of that, but it\u2019s not the only one.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from a James Fish with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","James Fish","The guys, congrats on a great quarter here and thanks for the questions. Frank more for you. You called out large ELAs being up year-over-year. And sequentially, can you just give us a sense as to how much ELAs got booked as virtual versus appliances? Or any sense of how big the ELA businesses as a percentage now within F5 as it seems like it\u2019s becoming more material over the last few quarters.","Frank Pelzer","Sure. And James, thank you so much for the congratulations, we also thought it was a great quarter. We don\u2019t quantify the effects of ELA, and I did say that we were up in terms of dollars for four sequential quarters and the deal count was also up over a broader base, and we\u2019re seeing our ASPs up as well. And so we\u2019re really, really happy with the way ELAs are trending and that they are unlocking the spend that we see, we see very robust pipeline going forward, because we really only scratched the surface on the opportunity set within our customer base. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not going to quantify the amount of ELAs, but I will say that it has been a positive trend for us.","James Fish","Got it. And then you guys had talked about the F5 and NGINX Controller kind of coming at year-end, it sounds like it actually got pushed a month. But also didn\u2019t really hear it too much around sort of the WAF-as-a-service global load balancer as a service. Any sense of the timing around those and how you guys are thinking about it for 2020? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Hey James, I\u2019ll take that one. No, the controller \u2013 the combined controller with NGINX was not pushed out a month. I think we said January when we last spoke and we\u2019re well on track to be able to deliver on that. We\u2019re pretty excited about it, because it enhances the addressable market for NGINX in the number of personas inside of the enterprise, the large enterprises. As it relates to the other question I think related to F5 Cloud Services, which is our SaaS offering.","And we have released our DNS offering a few months ago. We just released earlier this month our global server load balancing as a service offering. And we\u2019re seeing strong interest in that. And then Web Application Firewall as a service, WAF-as-a-service is next on our roadmap and that should happen before the end of the calendar year.","James Fish","Got it, thanks. Congrats again guys.","Operator","Your next question is from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Ashwin Kesireddy","Hi, thank you for taking my question. This is Ashwin on behalf of Rod. I was just wondering if you could comment on the sustainability of the strength in the U.S. federal vertical and how you\u2019re thinking about that in fiscal 2020? And another question related to competitive dynamics, can you comment on any changes you are seeing in the company to landscape, any color on win rates or anything you can give us post the acquisition completion of VMware-Avi Networks acquisition will be great.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Just \u2013 Ashwin, can you repeat the second part of the question? The first part was around the federal government. Then on the front of the second part\u2026","Ashwin Kesireddy","The second was really on the competitive landscape following the acquisition of VMware-Avi Networks. Can you comment on any changes in win rates or anything there will be helpful?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes. Ashwin, I\u2019ll take the second part on the competitive landscape and then Chad will take the question on the federal government and the sustainability of our strength there. So essentially, we haven\u2019t seen a change in the competitive landscape after the acquisition of VMware-Avi \u2013 sorry, by VMware.","On the last call, I mentioned to you, we were not seeing Avi in very many deals and where we see them, we have been pretty happy and comfortable without win rates, and so essentially that hasn\u2019t changed. I would expect it to change with the presence and distribution that VMware has around the world. And to see them more overtime, especially in customers that have gone all in on NFX, and really are tied to that infrastructure. But we don\u2019t see that as a very large proportion of the market, so more to come on that, but so far no change.","Chad Whalen","Perfect. Good afternoon, Ashwin. This is Chad Whalen. Regarding the strength of the fed business in 2020, as we did in their release federal performance in Q4 was fantastic. Much of this is sustainable for a very simple reason. We\u2019re a built into very large programs across the federal government base from three ledger agencies all the way through the Department of Defense. And so for 2020, we\u2019re planning for a very robust year in the federal government space as well built upon much of what we\u2019ve done over the last number of years within this \u2013 with this \u2013 excuse me, within this segment, drive in some of the key tenants within our security portfolio and some of the needs are unique to the federal government.","Ashwin Kesireddy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.","Tim Long","Thank you. Thanks a lot. Could you talk a little bit \u2013 two questions for me also. First, the new AWS partnership sounds like a nice expansion. Can you talk a little bit about the timing and when you think that could materially pick up kind of the cloud businesses for you and are there any other potential public cloud partnerships or expansions we should expect to see?","And then the second I wanted to follow back up on the systems business. Obviously, this transition going on just curious, is this scenario where we\u2019re going to need some kind of refresh for some of the customers? And if not given that it\u2019s becoming a smaller piece. From an investment standpoint, does this change the investment profile of the overall company where maybe there\u2019s a little less R&D or less of sales push on the hardware side and maybe that that means some overall better leverage on OpEx for the entire business. Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Tim. So let me start with the \u2013 your questions around AWS and the public cloud. Just for context Tim, our software business as you see as accelerated very significantly in 2019. And if you look at the second half of the year where our software grew about 90% year-on-year, our public cloud business is actually grown faster than that all year. So it has continued to grow because of the integrations we already done with public cloud providers, the availability of our solutions in market places and also enabling our customers to for the licenses into public clouds.","And so as a result of all this, our public cloud business have become a meaningful portion of our overall software business. Now the partnership with AWS, takes that to a new level, because we have been meeting AWS in the market where customers want AWS and want F5 and ask us to get together and help them move forward with their public cloud initiatives. But now we\u2019re going to have a number of AWS solution architects and professional services people who are trained on F5 and are designing in F5 into their architectures and their solutions when they\u2019re engaging customers.","And AWS obviously has a lot more resources than we do. So we look at that as a multiplier effect of our own resources in the market to design often for customers that want to leverage public cloud infrastructure. So we\u2019re very excited about that. And we\u2019re also very excited about the collaboration we\u2019ve agreed with them. On the product side, integrating things like our WAF into CloudFront to compliment their CDN with a security solution to enable them to better compete with the likes of Akamai and other integrations with a Control Tower, which is really how customers manage and deploy their applications in public cloud. So it\u2019s just going to give us an expanding surface into the public cloud and more visibility.","When that will impact our numbers? I think overall this is going to provide further acceleration to an already fast-growing public cloud business. And the specific impact of that partnership, I think is more of a second half of 2020 to 2021. But it could be significant.","On the second part of your question, which is on the hardware decline and what does that mean for our investments and potentially operating leverage. We\u2019re going to continue to manage the investment overall in hardware. We have a number of platforms that are in development that are going to come to market in the next few quarters. But overall, if you look at where we\u2019re at in terms of where we\u2019ve guided to on operating profit for this year, we\u2019ve said we would do about 33% to 35%, for the year and we expect to be in that range this year. And then, at our Analyst and Investor meeting, we will give you an update on what we think is going to happen in Horizon 2, which is 2021, 2022.","Tim Long","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open.","Paul Silverstein","I\u2019ve got some clarifications and then a couple of questions. First off, did you all give us the NGINX contribution? I know that the revenue was small at the time you acquired required them, but did you provide a number for NGINX?","Frank Pelzer","Paul, we did not. I mean, I told you in the call last quarter that we thought that it would be approximately $8 million. It was slightly more than that ever so slightly, but it was spun-on. And when you take a look at the inorganic and organic growth, it was almost the exact same as we had last quarter.","Paul Silverstein","And I trusted $8 million all software or primarily software?","Frank Pelzer","No, actually there\u2019s a split between software and services. The software component was approximately $6 million and the services was just slightly over $2 million.","Paul Silverstein","I appreciate. That\u2019s helpful. Now let me ask my question relative to that. So your hardware was down 15%, following 11% decline. You obviously made that up with software and then some \u2013 and we all know that software pricing or at least I think software pricing, maybe I shouldn\u2019t be so cavalier about it, but that software pricing is well below hardware pricing I trust that\u2019s a given before I ask the real question.","Frank Pelzer","No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a given Paul.","Paul Silverstein","There goes my friend. I guess I want to try to decipher looking forward is normally when one sees hardware decline of this magnitude. I would expect that to swamp your ability to transition the model at least over a transitionary phase, but you just put a gruff. And I guess from a big picture perspective, I\u2019m trying to decipher as we look forward what\u2019s going on and I\u2019ve listened attentively to your call. You said a lot of things on a lot of trends like that\u2019s \u2013 this is the first quarter in the Americas, we\u2019ve seen 11% year-over-year, 14% sequential. You haven\u2019t had a quarter of that type of growth in the Americas region in the U.S. You\u2019d have to go back about three years at the same time you cited macro conditions for depressing for the decline in EMEA, which had been strong up until the beginning of this year and APAC, which has been more mixed.","So again, first of all, if I could ask you to take a step back and appreciate you\u2019ve given us a lot of detailed information in the call, but from a big picture perspective, when you look at the regional trends, you look at the hardware to software mix before I ask you about margins, what\u2019s going on from a revenue perspective. The growth we saw in the Americas, is that the new norm?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes. Paul, I appreciate that there are lots of signals there that you\u2019re trying to make sense off. So let\u2019s talk about hardware, software first and then let\u2019s talk a little bit about geography. I mean, I think Paul, the reason I say it\u2019s not that the software price per unit is lower than the hardware price per unit is, because it really depends on the use case, the type of application, where it\u2019s deployed, what bundle of application services are used for that application. And in some cases, yes, it\u2019s lower, but there are a lot of cases where the software deal ends up being larger than the hardware deal would have been because the company can deploy more of it and more functions.","Paul Silverstein","I apologize for the interruption, but this exactly where I was going with this. I trust the reconciliations that unit volume, whether literally measured by units or measured by the use case that you\u2019re making up for the degradation on a like-for-like pricing basis, the differential between hardware and software and predating your arrival at F5, F5 consistently forever with site virtual additions at 80% of the price point of the hardware. I was assuming that hadn\u2019t changed or if anything is changed for the worst, not for the better. But assuming that\u2019s still the case, to the point you just made, I trust these deals are getting bigger and scope and that\u2019s why there\u2019s a possible offset in the revenue.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes. I think you\u2019re correct on both accounts. So it is still the case on your pricing comparison versus hardware, but in terms of the margin dollars to F5 that nets out to being about the same. If you just took pure functionality software versus software \u2013 software versus hardware, exactly the same functionality. What you said about the 70% to 80% versus 100% of hardware for the price per unit is true. But what happens when we are in \u2013 when we move to a software consumption form factor is that it\u2019s easier for us to expand our role with a customer, because they have more freedom to deploy the technology. They can add use cases faster. They can replicate the solution in multiple environments. And so the overall consumption becomes larger.","Now, if you look at the numbers I would point to, if you\u2019re looking our fiscal year 2018, our hardware only declined 4%, but our product revenue for the full year was flat with zero percent growth. If you look at 2019, our hardware declined 8%, but total product revenue was plus 3%. So you have kind of several quarters of us showing that the software growth is more than offsetting the hardware decline. And that\u2019s because our software story elevates our relevance with customers and gives us an opportunity to expand our role. I\u2019ll give you some examples in the script. The Rakuten deal I mentioned in Japan is a great example where we did a very large software deal with them and we came back three months later and already expended that with more kind of multimillion dollar software opportunity because of the speed of consumption and the number of use cases we\u2019re addressing. So that\u2019s our hardware software, Paul.","And if you tap out \u2013 touch a little bit on geography to your question. I think, we have seen EMEA, I think we continue to see micro uncertainty in Europe. And I don\u2019t see that changing in the first half of 2020 for a number of reasons that Brexit is a part of it. And generally, I think, Continental Europe, we\u2019re seeing just macro softness there. In North America, we had a very strong quarter in the federal government. We had a softer quarter in financial services and I would expect that we see better performance from financial services in the first half of 2020. And so generally, I expect North America to be healthy going into 2020.","Paul Silverstein","All right. Can I ask you quick question on margins? If your services have consistently been 87% plus minus 30 basis points over the past five quarters, your product margin was just subset over 85% following almost 84% last quarter from 82% to 83% in the nine previous quarters. I trust the improvements driven by the shift to software from hardware and I trust that trend should continue.","Frank Pelzer","That\u2019s right, Paul.","Paul Silverstein","All right, I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Alex Kurtz","Yes, thanks. Just a clarification then a question that the long term deferred, I think was strong in the quarter, just kind of what was the dynamic in short and long term. And then Fran\u00e7ois, just kind of following up on Paul\u2019s question around, kind of share of wallet or how you\u2019re increasing use case within existing customers. So how does \u2013 what are the applications or the use cases that when you transition to software you make it more easily consumable that you\u2019re capturing, right, within existing account? Like what\u2019s that bell curve type of outcome that you\u2019re seeing right now?","Frank Pelzer","Sure. So \u2013 thanks, Alex. I think the on the long term deferred, a lot of that was driven by the growth of ELAs and some unbilled receivables. And so that\u2019s why you saw the strength in the long term deferred revenue.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","And then, Alex, your second question is on the types of use cases that we\u2019re seeing.","Alex Kurtz","Yes. When you\u2019ve transitioned most of your portfolio to software, you\u2019re talking about incremental use cases that allowing you to grow your share of wallet. So above and beyond the traditional ADC, like what are you seeing in these bigger software deals that are driving the bigger outcomes?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","So now it\u2019s two things. Number one, you might see a deal in hardware that is load balancing only. And then \u2013 when we were in a software, because it\u2019s kind of natural for our customers to consolidate multiple software modules. We will do load balancing DNS WaaS and other capabilities. So you\u2019re adding more capabilities to the deal. But the other factor also is that when we\u2019re in software, a customer has an ability to deploy that, not just in their data center, but they\u2019ll deploy in a public cloud, they\u2019ll deploy it multiple public clouds, sometimes in private cloud. So you\u2019ll see more kind of replication of a virtual instance to F5.","And then the third factor that expands our opportunity in software is that the public cloud model for security is a shared security model, where the public cloud provider secures the neighborhood and the customer, the enterprise has to secure their home. And by definition, that\u2019s a forcing function for our customers to add more security to the software in the public cloud. And so as a result of that, our security attach rates in software use cases that are deployed in the cloud is much higher, if I could stumble the picture of the attach rates in on-prem. So those are the three factors that are driving expansion of the opportunity in software.","Alex Kurtz","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one last question. The last question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Victor Chiu","Hi guys, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. Can you tell us by your estimation, what portion of the ADC market has gone to the public cloud and what your view is on the trajectory in the rate of continued adoption? And I guess off of that \u2013 of your existing customers that have migrated at least some portion of their workloads, what portion continues to utilize F5 solutions there?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","What was the second part of the question, Victor?","Victor Chiu","Of your existing customers that have migrated at least some portion of the workloads, what portion of them \u2013 do you expect continued or are continuing to utilize F5 solutions?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","All right, I\u2019ll take the second part of your question, first. And then we\u2019ll come to the first part. Generally, Victor, customers who are on F5, on-prem who migrate to the public cloud majority of them are migrating with F5. And that\u2019s because it\u2019s a lot easier to do that than to go ahead and if you don\u2019t want to have to refactor an application, it\u2019s a lot easier to migrate with F5 than not. And that\u2019s one of the benefits for AWS also have the partnership with often allowed this migration to happen a lot faster, but the medivators \u2013 the vast majority of our customers who are on F5, to be on F5 in the public cloud.","Kara Sprague","Yes. And Victor, this is Kara. With regard to your first question, the question was about roughly what share of the ADC market, do we see having moved to the public cloud I think that\u2019s what you asked. What we actually see as these applications start getting lit up in public cloud is an expansion in terms of the use cases for ADC like technology. So what \u2013 it has typically been bucketed into the ADC market has been things that include load balancing, there\u2019s been parts of application security and other things. Those capabilities are getting lit up in public clouds, either through the public cloud native providers or through third party providers like F5. And in many cases, those applications that are there are oftentimes net new cloud native applications that are taking advantage of those services. And so that has been an expansion of the TAM for that market.","Victor Chiu","Right. And are there any headwinds competing with now in the public cloud alternative solutions guys like Amazon?","Kara Sprague","Well, you thought from the strategic agreement as we see, there\u2019s a lot more synergy between our two companies and a lot more of partnership opportunity than actual competition. And in fact, one of the big benefits that F5 brings to this \u2013 as F5 has been the go to ADC solution provider for our enterprise customers for their most important applications. Many of those most important applications are still sitting on-prem. And there looking at numerous public clouds vendors, for selection for their new workloads or for modernizing their old applications. In the case of the new workloads, they\u2019re finding use cases that apply for the public cloud native capabilities as well as use cases that apply for vendors like F5, especially, where they value that multi-cloud story. And for the modernization of their old applications, what we\u2019re finding is that our customers really want to move those applications and modernize them with F5, because it gives them an easier path into the public cloud.","Victor Chiu","Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, a replay of today\u2019s call will be made available approximately two hours and will be accessible until November 6 at Midnight Eastern.

Q2 was a quarter of solid execution. We continue to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures, and our Services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit.","Second quarter revenue of $533 million, up 3% year-over-year, was above the midpoint of our guided range of $525 million to $535 million. GAAP EPS of $1.77 per share was above our guidance of $1.66 to $1.69 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.31 per share was also above our guidance of $2.24 to $2.27 per share.","Product revenue of $238 million in the second quarter was down 1% year-over-year and accounted for 45% of total revenue. Software in Q2 was 15% of product revenue and was up 28% year-over-year. Systems revenue declined 5% year-over-year and made up 85% of product revenue. Services revenue of $296 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue.","On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 1% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 26% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, grew 2% year-over-year, and Japan at 4% of total revenue decreased 6% from a year ago.","Sales to enterprise customers represented 66% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 21% and government sales were 13%, including 5% from U.S. Federal.","In Q2, we had five greater-than-10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which accounted for 17% of total revenue; Tech Data accounted for 12%; and Arrow, SYNNEX and Westcon, each accounted for 11% of revenue.","Moving on to our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. GAAP operating expenses of $300 million were within our $296 million to $306 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $264 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 26.9% and non-GAAP operating margin was 35.2%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 25% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24.7%.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q2, we generated $185 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.4 billion at quarter end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.8 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $30 million.","Deferred revenue increased 8.7% year-over-year to just over $1 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,385 employees, up slightly from the prior quarter. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $140.82 per share for a total of $150 million.","Moving to our guidance for fiscal Q3. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see momentum building in the business as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. We expect further improvement in our revenue growth rate in the third quarter, highlighted by a return to year-over-year product revenue growth.","With this in mind, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we are targeting revenue in the range of $535 million to $545 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at or around 84.5%.","We estimate GAAP operating expense of $297 million to $307 million, including approximately $36.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the third quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. And our Q3 GAAP earnings target is $1.79 to $1.82 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.36 to $2.39 per share.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Fran\u00e7ois.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter, we saw momentum across the business. Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 28% year-over-year. This growth was driven by deployments in the public cloud as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environment. We saw strong demand for our security solutions at our enterprise customers as they embrace our Web Application Firewall, identity and access management and SSL capabilities.","Our Services business had another solid quarter with revenue up 7% year-over-year and non-GAAP gross margins above 86%. This group provides customer support that is unmatched by any of our competitors, creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction and stickiness. The value of our Services capabilities only grows as complexities associated with multi-cloud deployments impact more customers.","We had strong execution during the second quarter and we are encouraged by the underlying trends as we move into the second half of fiscal 2018. Our software solutions are gaining traction across deployment environments with strength in public cloud, Bring Your Own License and utility-based consumption. We saw good customer interest in our recently-introduced consumption models, particularly Enterprise License Agreements. The ability to offer more flexibility in procuring and deploying our Virtual Editions is enabling more strategic conversations with customers allowing us to reach a broader set of buyers.","During the quarter, we closed several meaningful ELAs, including a transaction with a U.S.-based communication services company, which also included a hardware refresh and service renewal. Through an ELA structure for our Virtual Editions, we were able to meet the customer's need for enabling speed to market for their applications and frictionless movement between cloud providers as they aggressively roll out a multi-cloud strategy.","Our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial technology provider helped us replace an incumbent WAF vendor in an account where we were not historically the primary ADC or WAF. Key to winning this deal was the breadth of our WAF functionality, the flexibility for enabling speed to market for application services provisioning, and the ability for our Virtual Editions to interact with our Silverline WAF and DDoS services. In both transactions, our ability to structure ELAs drove larger overall opportunities for F5.","The traction we are seeing in software will be further enhanced by the introduction of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially announced earlier today. This release allows us to better reach the next tier of applications within our existing customers through improvements in usability and comprehensive per-app visibility, analytics and auto-scale capabilities. The solution gives customers a lightweight option when developing, deploying, and securing all applications at every step in the testing and production pipeline, including use cases designed around public and private clouds.","Security is a critical component of an increasing number of our customer interactions. We saw good momentum in our WAF offerings, which delivered a solid year-over-year growth during Q2. We also saw growing customer interest in our identity and SSL solutions targeted at enterprise accounts.","A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at a U.S. Government agency, driven by the performance of our BIG-IP appliances with our WAF modules. A key differentiation in this deal was our ability to scale well in excess of the competition to meet the customer's need to protect over 100 global web-based applications.","Our industry-leading WAF portfolio takes another meaningful step ahead of the competition with the availability of our Advanced WAF offering, an important component of our stand-alone security strategy. We have customized the form factor, features, and user interface in way that enable security teams to focus on getting the information they need to know, when they need to know it. As we outlined in March, we see additions to our security portfolio over the course of 2018 opening substantial new addressable opportunities.","Core enhancements with Advanced WAF include bot detection beyond signatures and reputation to block evolving automated attacks, application layer encryption to protect against credential theft and DDoS detection using machine learning and behavioral analytics at layer 7.","Advanced WAF supports a variety of consumption and licensing models, including a per-app, perpetual, subscription and utility billing. We are already seeing strong customer interest in the differentiated capabilities provided by our Advanced WAF, which is evident in a deal we won during the second quarter at a large African stock exchange, where our behavioral DDoS capabilities, in-browser encryption, and ability to integrate with our Silverline offering allowed us to stand out from traditional WAF vendors and cloud-native solutions.","In a situation where the customer is migrating workloads to a multi-cloud environment, the ability to centralize critical security services and the cost savings versus individual cloud provider offerings resonated with the customer.","From an organizational perspective, we are excited to announce Frank Pelzer has agreed to join the F5 team as our new CFO starting on May 21. Frank brings to F5 tremendous software and cloud experience, most recently as the President and COO as Cloud Business Group at SAP. Previously, he was CFO at Concur Technologies, a leading publicly-traded cloud-based travel and expense management solution that was purchased by SAP in 2014. Frank's background makes him an ideal fit for the next phase of F5's growth.","We also announced today that John DiLullo, our EVP of Worldwide Sales, will be leaving the company in May to pursue other opportunities. Steve McMillan, our Head of Global Services, will oversee the sales organization, while we undertake a full search to find John's permanent successor. In John's time at F5, he laid a restructuring of F5's sales organization, including evolving our channel program to better address cloud-enablement partners and security opportunities.","With a strong set of theater leads now in place, the organization is structured for success, as is evident in our improved execution over the past several quarters.","As we outlined at our March Analyst & Investor Meeting, we are evolving from an ADC company to a multi-cloud application service company that will reach every app anywhere. Our conviction that multi-cloud application services will define the next phase of F5's growth is only bolstered by my conversations with our customers.","Having spent time with dozens of them this past year in every theater and across a diverse set of industries, not one of them believes the complexities they are facing managing their apps across multiple clouds can be solved by a single generalist cloud provider. They require a focused player who understands the intricacies of enterprise applications.","While we have meaningful work ahead of us to achieve the goals we outlined in early March, I am pleased with our execution over the past several quarters. Both in delivering to the near-term financial targets we have laid out and with the progress in prioritizing and accelerating efforts in product development and go to market.","As we move into the second half of our fiscal year, we see momentum both in terms of growing our product revenue and in continuing to deliver strong profitability and cash generation. We are focused on executing to the long-term strategy that we outlined in March and we look forward to updating you on continued progress over the coming quarters.","Finally, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the second quarter. In particular, I want to thank Andy for his contributions over the past 20 years as he will be retiring from F5 in May. Andy was a key part of growing F5 into the $2 billion annual business it is today, instilling the structure and discipline that helped drive our enviable margins and cash generation. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past year. And I know I speak for everyone at F5 in wishing him nothing but happiness and success in his future endeavors.","With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session for today's conference. Our first question comes from Jason Ader from William Blair. Jason, your line is now open.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, thank you very much. And, Andy, wanted to wish you my best, and it's been fun working with you over all these years. So, good luck in your next chapter.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Jason. Same.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","So, my question really is on the \u2013 I guess it looks like you're seeing some pick-up on the product side. And maybe it's a combination of infrastructure refresh and some momentum in software. I guess, firstly, is that leading to some larger deals? And it sounds like there may be some ELAs that are starting to get pretty chunky. And then, why do you think you didn't see more infrastructure refresh last year when you had iSeries just coming out and the rest of the industry seemed to be experiencing more refresh? Why do you think there has been this lag?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Hi, Jason. Thanks for the question. I'll start with the latter part. I think what we've seen last year is a number of customers who were considering or reconsidering their architecture, especially looking to move towards a multi-cloud environment and trying to figure out how much they would deploy in hardware, how much they would deploy in software, what would be in public cloud and private clouds and so forth. I think we talked about it last year, saying the decision cycle in some cases was causing some pause in their decision-making.","I think to a certain extent that still exists, and we still see that dynamic in the marketplace. But I think we see also a number of customers that have kind of made their decisions on their architecture. And therefore, they're moving forward on their decisions. And whether it's ELAs in software or some hardware deployments, they're just moving forward. So I think that's the dynamic we're seeing in the market. I think in a number of cases we also see customers who have waited to make these decisions. But application traffic and the pressures on traffic kind of catches up with them and, at some point, they have to move forward and make their decisions. So, that's the dynamic in the market.","In terms of ELAs, Jason, that's an offering that's only been in the market for us for really only a couple of quarters. And we're really pleased with the traction that we're seeing with this mode of consumption. It just gives a lot more flexibility to our customers to deploy our technologies in a frictionless way across on-prem or public cloud. And both the initial traction and the initial deals that we're seeing are, in fact, pretty chunky.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","And then, Jason, I'd jump in and add to your question around deal sizes. Overall, we saw our average deal size increase in the quarter over Q1. So, Q1, we were at $113,000, and that increased to right at $123,000. And we also saw in Q2 \u2013 for Q2, in particular, a significant step-up in million-dollar deals, which is, for us, a good sign of business, especially this early in the calendar year.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Is that contributing to the visibility for the second half? Is that part of it?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, I think in both Fran\u00e7ois and my commentary, talking about momentum and talking with the salespeople, it's definitely a dynamic that we keep our eye on when we're assessing to make statements like that.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you, Jason. And our next question comes from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Alex, your line is now open.","Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, guys, for taking the questions here. So, as the sales organization starts moving towards ELA type of sales processes and, obviously, introducing some multi-cloud products that are new to customers and to the sales org, do you see a need to change or to kind of re-factor how the sales organization goes to market or how it's constituted? Or do you feel like the folks that you have in place can execute like a VMware-type ELA consistently every quarter? Or maybe you just don't see ELAs becoming a big part of the business longer term and it's not an issue?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Alex. It's a good question. So a couple of data points, perhaps just to frame the context for this. Software revenues are about 15% of our product revenues today, and largely ELA's applied primarily to our software business. So just to frame how much of a play it has in our current business.","In terms of the implications for the sales organization, I'd say, number one, we are largely going after our existing customers so that the same large enterprises and large service providers that have been customers of F5 are the customers that want to consume us in these ELAs. So, it doesn't require for our sales organization to find an entirely new set of customers. We're talking about providing a different consumption model to our existing customers.","We have been preparing the sales organization for this, so it's really more about enablement, making sure that the team understands the intricacies of these commercial models, and also making sure we have the right incentives in place. And so at the beginning of this year, we put some incentives in place for our sales organization to make sure that it was attractive for them to sell and market these ELAs. And I think we're seeing the traction as a result of that.","Alex Kurtz - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And Andy, it's a pleasure working with you and good luck with what's next.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Alex.","Operator","Thank you, Alex. And our next question comes from Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Rod, your line is now open.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Yeah, first of all, Andy, great working with you as well and best of luck in the future.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I just had a couple of questions. One is Japan. The revenue rebound there was pretty substantial. So I just wonder if you guys could comment on the sustainability of that. Is that kind of more back to a normal level in your minds, or what's happening in Japan and how sustainable is it?","And then the second question I had was just regarding the ex-Federal growth rate. That number kind of is up quarter-on-quarter, which looks a little bit better. So, I'm just curious what you think the trajectory of that non-U.S. Federal Government revenue looks like through the course of the year. Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Rod. I think I'll take Japan and Andy will talk to the Federal piece. Yes, so in Japan, I think generally you should look at that revenue as pretty stable. It's still a relatively small business in the overall picture of F5. So, you may experience a little bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter there. But what we're seeing right now, the momentum is pretty stable. I think there were some \u2013 cloud providers were perhaps a little late to the Japanese market relative to other markets and we're seeing actually a pickup in demand there with this multi-cloud strategy as well.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","And then to the Government question, if you set Federal aside, yeah, you're right. It would look like \u2013 outside of the U.S. and state and local, it looks stronger, and that's lumpy for us, though, it's hard when we look at non-Federal to really see any determined seasonality, and I think an element of it is lumpiness. Federal, on the other hand, which was okay for Q2, we definitely see the September quarter much stronger with the other quarters kind of around this level. So, that's what I would attribute it to.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Suva from Citi. Jim, your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very (27:36) much. Can you talk about how we should think about the quarter linearity for this calendar year, the products and services? Kind of how you think about the linearity of whether it'd be seasonal, up, down, any product launch, transitions? How we should think about the products and services and, I guess, also security for this year?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","So, Jim, you're asking just how are we looking at the linearity this year and expectations for revenue through the year? I'll consider that yes. I mean, I still think the way we see our year lay out, and I don't think we've changed our view on this, is Q1, Q2 are usually slower part of the year for us. And then going in the back half, Q3, Q4, which is our June and September quarters, is where we see strength. And a lot of that is how the sales organization is incented, Federal in Q4. And as you can see in my comments, for Q3, we expect to get back to product revenue growth, which is implied in the guidance that we gave and we think that bodes well for going into Q4 as well. So, generally, that's the view of linearity.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much for the information, yeah, that's what I was asking for. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Simon, your line is now open.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First of all, Andy, congratulations. Best of luck wherever you head next. In terms of questions, two things I wanted to see if we could investigate. One is noticing the substantial deferred revenue, is it possible to quantify some aspect of the mix between software and services in that deferred revenue? I'm assuming that software is getting to be more significant within that. Can you help us quantify the mix?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, when you look at the deferred revenue, the vast majority of it today is maintenance contracts. So, you're right that it is building software and deferred related to that, but still the vast majority is the maintenance contracts.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Appreciate that. And I wanted to see if we could delve a little bit more deeply in terms of the security mix. My impression is that WAF is really where you lead and sort of where you get much of the attention. I'm not necessarily trying to get a strict break down. But is your security-related revenue strongly dominated by the WAF products or is there a good traction in terms of identity, SSL? I'm looking for some idea of how we should think about the drivers.","And in terms of the security market, certainly coming out of RSA last week, it sounds like expectations are that this particular market overall is getting better growth. Are you seeing better growth in security than what you anticipated just three months ago? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Simon, I'll take that. So first of all, no, I would say our security traction in revenues is not just on Web Application Firewall. It's actually broader than that. We're getting a lot of traction in identity and access management, as an example, in SSL orchestration, which we've talked about; also in DDoS, with the introduction of our DDoS Hybrid Defender. So, there's a broad range of products that we introduced actually in our Q1 that are getting strong traction.","We are talking about WAF in part because we introduced an Advanced WAF product that is very differentiated in the marketplace and allows us to extend our addressable opportunity, because it addresses a number of use cases we weren't addressing before, including things like layer 7 DDoS with machine learning and behavioral analytics, or preventing credential theft and abuse, which essentially we're the only vendor who provide these capabilities today. And so, we're highlighting that introduction, but the traction is pretty broad.","Overall, in terms of growth in the security space, I'd say, we did expect to be growing in this area. We have said it was a strong driver and it continues to be a strong driver, and will be in the second half of the year.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Ittai, your line is now open.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. And, Andy, let me add my congratulations and good luck to you. It's been a pleasure. As to my questions, I wanted to focus on the software part of your business. Is there a way you can, if not actually quantify, at least qualitatively talk about how much of that revenue is split between Virtual Editions, Silverline, your as-a-service business and cloud consumption?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Ittai, we'll try and give you some pointers here. I would say, first of all, a majority of our software business is in the Virtual Editions. But a growing part of the consumption of the Virtual Edition is across multiple clouds, including consumptions of Virtual Editions in the public cloud. And so today, our customers buy Virtual Editions for on-prem deployments, but they also buy them to instantiate them in Amazon, or Azure, or Google's public clouds. And that's a growing part of the software business.","The other factor, which is going to be, I think, an accelerating factor in that, is the introduction of our Cloud Edition today, really makes the consumption of Virtual Editions in the public cloud a lot easier; A, because it provides a lighter weight Virtual Edition to be used on a per-app basis. And a lot of folks who want to deploy in the public cloud want to do it on a per-app basis. And, B, because we provide with the Cloud Edition a centralized orchestration mechanism that allows customers to turn Virtual Editions on and off, or even to scale the deployment of Virtual Editions across multiple clouds, or across on-prem and public clouds. So, it's a big catalyst for Virtual Editions deployment across multi-clouds.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Got it. Just want to follow-up on that. Are you not concerned that the introduction of this BIG-IP Cloud Edition would kind of cannibalize your more \u2013 your existing Virtual Edition volume? And help me think about, as you look at the customers that have been adopting software from you, is there a way to think about what portion of those customers are actually net new to F5 versus software is just a reflection of a different purchasing framework for them?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, Ittai, so to the first question, are we worried that the Cloud Edition will cannibalize our classic Virtual Edition? The short answer to that is no, we're not, and largely because customers who use the Virtual Editions today, they use it to typically support multiple applications, basically five to eight applications, I would say, on average. And the Virtual Edition is only to be used on a per-app basis. And there are very few customers who use a classic VE on a per-app basis. So, I think the cannibalization will be minimal.","The other aspect of that is the per-app Virtual Edition also allows our customers to support and put Virtual Editions in front of applications that traditionally would not have had them. So, it's an expansion of use cases for us, including in security. The Cloud Edition is a great vehicle for our customers to put, for example, a Web Application Firewall in front of all their applications, which increasingly they want to do and, sometimes, they're required to do by regulation.","So to the second point around which customers are deploying our software, I would say, it's actually both, existing and new customers. Most of our large customers are considering some form of addition of software to their existing hardware deployments. But we also have net new customers who haven't bought any hardware from F5 and are going straight to a Virtual Edition, either in the cloud or in their own data centers.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Very good. Good luck, guys.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Ittai.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mark Kelleher from D. A. Davidson. Mark, your line is now open.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Andy, congratulations, let me add mine as well. It's been great working with you. I wanted to ask about Silverline, specifically. Can you talk a little bit about how important that is for your sales effort and how big that's growing? And then, along those lines, as your model changes a little bit to more software, more security, how's the competitive environment changing? Who do you see as your challengers there?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Mark, let me start with Silverline. It's actually linked to your second question. What we're seeing is key, both in the Web Application Firewall market and in the DDoS market, which is where the Silverline offering has been focused, is the ability to offer both an on-prem solution and, essentially, an off-prem scrubbing center solution is actually key for a lot of large enterprise customers. And beyond that, the ability for us to signal from an on-prem solution to a customer that they should divert their traffic to a scrubbing center on an automated basis is absolutely a key differentiator. And that's really what Silverline brings to the table, is we have this ability to offer on-prem and off-prem solution and very strong signaling between the two solutions. And that's really the differentiator between us and other vendors that are either purely in a cloud DDoS or cloud WAF space or purely on the on-prem space.","In terms of software and security, I think I'd have to separate those two. In security, we compete with basically a number of players and it really depends on the use case and the type of solution. In the space of \u2013 in software, really, I think we have perhaps smaller competitors that have an interesting story around nimbleness and agility of deployment. But what we've seen is really what the customer wants is both the agility of deployment and a depth and breadth of features to support critical applications. And I think with the Cloud Edition, we're essentially the only player that really brings both of those things to the market for the first time and we think it's actually going to grow the addressable market for virtual ADCs.","Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Baird. Jason, your line is now open.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Super. My congrats too. Andy, it's been quite some time. Fran\u00e7ois, a question on stand-alone security and coming out of RSA, any incremental thoughts there. And then, what do you expect to see with the split between on-premise solutions and cloud-based solutions from F5? And then, Andy, as a follow up, job postings at F5 have doubled roughly year-to-date. Should we expect a hiring ramp later this year? And I'll leave it there.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Jayson, couple of things. First, on the on-prem versus cloud offerings for F5, I think overall, the message I'd give you is that on-prem deployment for us is still the majority of the business, though, cloud deployments are growing relatively fast and certainly faster than on-prem deployment.","The thing, though, for us that is the catalyst is that we're seeing \u2013 I would say, not a single one of the customers that I have spoken to in the last six months has articulated to me a strategy that was not a multi-cloud strategy. And so, every one of our customers has plans for evolving their on-prem architectures and potentially growing their deployment and doing some things in one or multiple clouds, and a lot of times they want to replicate their on-prem environment across multiple clouds. That's a big driver for us, because we're, I think, uniquely positioned as a vendor that supports both across their journey. Andy?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","In line with our commentary about expectations for the back half, returning to product revenue growth, momentum in the business, yeah, the hiring is ramping up a bit. And we'll continue to manage it as we always have and watch the quarters unfold against our expectations on a week-by-week basis and adjust as we need to. But if all goes according to expectations, we should see hiring pick up.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jayson.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal from Nomura Instinet. Jeff, your line is now open.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Yes. Thank you very much. And I guess, Fran\u00e7ois, to begin with you, could you help us understand a little bit with a little bit more resolution what the cadence of new products may be across the course of the year? We've got some now. You talked at your Analyst Day about some through 2018 into 2019. And then that may segue into the second part of that, which is you'd talked about share gains in both physical and virtual, and if you could update us on that, that would be wonderful. Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jack (sic) [Jeff] (43:25). So, what you should see in terms of new products is \u2013 so we did announce some of the products in our App Protect portfolio and campaign in February, including the Advanced WAF. We are going to release the Cloud Edition at the end of May this year. In the second half of this year, you should see more security, new stand-alone security products from our portfolio come to market and we'll talk about that at the right time. And then, you will see also from us in the first half of 2019 some exciting announcements, generally, in the software space and cloud solutions. So I think over the next 12 months, we're bringing to market some new solutions that essentially extend our addressable market into new use cases.","In the hardware space, we have released a new variant of our iSeries, I think both at the low end and at the high end, first iSeries with 100 gig capabilities, and we're seeing quite a bit of traction with that capability coming up because moving to 100 gig in data centers is \u2013 not just in our ADC category, but across a number of other categories, that's a hot topic at the moment. So, that's what's ahead.","Your second question was about share gains in virtual ADC and hardware. On that topic, I think what we've said at our AIM conference really stands in that. We feel that, overall, our hardware business, if you look at 2018, we expect that to decline in the low-single digit to flat. I think overall, based on what we see as market forecast, we will gain share, because the expectation of the market is declining at mid-single digits. And the reason I feel pretty good about that share gain is because I feel good about our position with service providers. I feel very good about the use cases that iSeries is enabling and the breadth of use cases that we can attack. And I feel very good about the conversation we're having with customers having made their decisions on architecture. So, I think I stand by what we said at AIM.","In the case of the virtual ADC space, it's more of a nascent space, but growing fast. And I think if we maintain the growth rate that you've been seeing for the first half of the year, we clearly will be gaining share in that market.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","And repeating the software break out you gave at the beginning, we literally had a fire drill happening here. I just couldn't catch that.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","You couldn't catch the part on software, Jack?","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","The software split at the beginning. I'm so sorry.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","So, the software was 15% of product revenue and the growth rate for Q2 was 28% year-on-year growth.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Instinet","Great. Thank you.","Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc.","Operator, I think we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Notter from Jefferies. George, your line is now open.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Thanks very much and, Andy, best of luck to you. I wanted to ask about the product growth rate. Obviously, it's been a real improvement here from December to March to your guidance for June and the back part of the year. I guess the question, is there a way to sort of apportion that improvement in growth rate by the different variables here, the product refresh, growth in Virtual Editions, maybe it's ELAs or Silverline? Just bigger or smaller than a breadbox type of question, like where do you think the growth is really coming from? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, George. Well, if you recall, George, I think it was in our Q4 \u2013 at the end of our Q4 in the October earnings call, we shared at the time that we felt pretty good that we would return to product revenue growth in 2018. And at the time, we said the reasons were, number one, we had put the number of initiatives in with our sales organization in terms of some restructuring and some better alignment of our teams against some opportunities. And I feel John and his team have been executing very well against these initiatives and we're seeing that.","Number two, we were also expecting to see traction with some new offerings we had put in place, including ELAs and subscriptions. And we are actually seeing that, and that's contributing. And then number three, the offerings that you're hearing, iSeries, what we've done on iSeries and the refresh, some of these new security offerings that we've put in place, all of these are catalysts for enhancement in product revenue growth. And we now have better line of sight to this than we did six months ago. So, all of the above are actually contributing, frankly, in line with what we felt would happen throughout the year.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, George.","Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc.","I'd like to thank everyone for participating today, and we look forward to speaking with you again over the coming months.

Thank you for joining us today. I'll talk briefly to our business drivers before handing over to Frank to review the quarter's results in detail.","We continue to aggressively execute our strategy of transitioning F5 to a software-driven model. From our efforts to reprioritize our development resources to the introduction of new, flexible consumption models, and most recently, the acquisition and integration of NGINX, customers are seeing a new F5. ","We believe the steps we have taken including very deliberate go-to-market changes are accelerating our transition to a software-driven business while driving overall product revenue growth. As a result, it is no longer accurate to view F5 through the narrow lens of a traditional ADC player.","In Q3, we delivered 4% total revenue growth and 3% product revenue growth with 79% organic software growth. If we include the partial quarter of NGINX, our software growth was 91%. Our exceptional software growth in the quarter is being driven by security use cases, including web application firewall, and bot-defense and mitigation. The quarter also included a few multimillion dollar ELA deals.","Software growth was partially offset by our systems business, which was down 11%. Our services business delivered 4% revenue growth in the quarter and continues to produce robust gross margins with consistently strong attach rates.","I will speak more to our business dynamics and the NGINX integration later in my remarks. Overall, the team is executing very well against our long-term strategy. We believe with the combination of NGINX, we are exceedingly well-positioned to capitalize on continued application growth in a rapidly evolving application services landscape. Frank?","Frank Pelzer","Thank you, Francois, and good afternoon, everyone.","As Francois noted, we delivered another quarter of strong revenue and EPS growth. As you know, we closed the acquisition of NGINX on May 8th, and our Q3 results include NGINX from that point through quarter-end. As a reminder, our guidance for Q3 revenue and earnings was set prior to the close of the NGINX acquisition, and accordingly did not include any impact related to NGINX' results.","For this quarter only, during my remarks I will break out NGINX's contribution to several Q3 performance metrics. Going forward, NGINX's contribution will be fully integrated into our results and guidance.","Third quarter revenue of $563 million was up approximately 4% year-over-year. NGINX contributed $5.1 million in the period. Excluding NGINX's contribution, we delivered revenue of $558 million, near the top end of our guided range of $550 million to $560 million.","GAAP EPS was $1.43 per share, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.52 per share. Excluding the impact of NGINX, non-GAAP EPS would have been $2.57 per share, at the top end of our guidance range. Q3 product revenue of $249 million was up 4% year-over-year and accounted for approximately 44% of total revenue. NGINX contributed $4 million to product revenue in the quarter, all of which was subscription software revenue.","As Francois mentioned, software grew 91% year-over-year and represented approximately 27% of product revenue, up from Q2 when it was approximately 19% of product revenue. Excluding NGINX, software revenue grew 79% year-over-year and represented 26% of product revenue. In the quarter, we had very strong uptake on our software solutions sold as ELAs and annual subscriptions.","Under the modified retrospective approach to ASC 606, we are required to compare our results under 606 to what they would have been under 605 during the first year of adoption. In the quarter, the implementation of 606 resulted in $29 million more in recognized revenue, compared to what it would have been under 605, excluding any impact of NGINX.","I would like to remind everyone of one point about our business. In the year-ago quarter, almost all our revenue was being driven by perpetual licenses or other consumption models that are not impacted by the adoption of 606. Had ASC 606 been applied to our Q3 2018 quarter, you would have seen a de minimis difference in revenue. Therefore, the adoption of 606 had little impact on our revenue growth in the quarter.","Systems revenue of $181 million made up approximately 73% of product revenue and was down 11% year-over-year. Services revenue of $314 million grew 4% year-over-year and represented approximately 56% of total revenue. NGINX contributed $1.1 million in services revenue in the quarter.","On a regional basis, in Q3, Americas revenue declined 1% year-over-year and represented 53% of total revenue. EMEA was up 2% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of overall revenue. APAC was very strong in the quarter with revenue growth of 22% year-over-year, representing 23% of total revenue.","Looking at our bookings by vertical. Enterprise customers represented 60% of product bookings and service providers accounted for 20%. Our government business was very strong, representing 19% of product bookings including 8% from U.S. Federal. In Q3, we had three greater than 10% distributors. Ingram Micro, which accounted for 18% of total revenue; Tech Data, which accounted for 11%; and Westcon, which accounted for 10%.","Let\u2019s now turn to operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.9%; non-GAAP gross margin was 85.4%, in line with our expectations. GAAP operating expenses were $370 million; non-GAAP operating expenses were $295 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses excluding NGINX were on the higher end of our expectations as a result of higher sales commissions related to software sales.","Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 18.2% and our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.1%. Excluding NGINX, non-GAAP operating margin was 34.2%, which was in line with our expectations. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 20.7%.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q3, we generated $150 million in cash flow from operations, down from recent levels, mainly due to the strength in subscription sales including ELAs where revenue proceeds the collection of cash.","Cash and investments totaled $1.15 billion at quarter-end. DSOs at the end of the quarter were 51 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million, up sequentially as we approached the final phases of building out our new facility in Downtown Seattle and our new facility in Hyderabad. Deferred revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $1.17 billion, a little less than half of the increase over the prior year quarter relates to the adoption of 606.","We ended the quarter with approximately 5,195 employees, up 400 people from Q2, reflecting the addition of NGINX and our continued hiring in growth areas including sales, and research and development. In Q3, we did not repurchase any of our common stock, opting instead to rebuild our cash balance, following the NGINX acquisition. We continue to view cash as a strategic asset for our future growth. Though our primary focus with cash generation is augmenting our strong balance sheet, we may opt to repurchase shares during any open trading window.","Now, let me share our guidance for fiscal Q4 of 2019. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics and include our NGINX business. We continue to make strong progress transitioning our business to a software-driven model. We remain confident in our position in the market and expect our growth will be driven by the growth of applications and increasing demand for our multi-cloud application services. We also expect continued strong demand for our software solutions, including subscription and ELA offerings. With this in mind, we are targeting Q4 \u201819 revenue in the range of $577 million to $587 million.","We note, for Q4, we expect NGINX to contribute less than $8 million in revenue, which includes the impact of purchase accounting write-down of deferred revenue. We do not expect to provide NGINX-specific guidance after this quarter.","We expect gross margins of approximately 85.5% to 86%. We estimate operating expenses of $301 million to $313 million. We anticipate our effective tax rate for Q4 will remain in the 21% to 22% range, as previously provided for the full fiscal year.","Our Q4 earnings target is $2.53 to $2.56 per share. In the quarter, we expect share-based compensation expense of approximately $43 million, and $4.6 million in amortization of purchase intangible assets. We expect Q4 CapEx of $25 million to $35 million as we complete the buildout of our new corporate headquarters.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Francois. Francois?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Frank.","I'll spend just a few minutes on the trends we're seeing in the business as well as the NGINX integration before moving to Q&A. F5 today is very different than the F5 of even 24 months ago.","A year ago in March, we laid out our strategy for transitioning F5 to a software-driven model. Since then, the team has been executing on that strategy and making deliberate changes that have substantially reshaped F5 and our growth opportunities.","What do I mean by that? In the last 24 months, we have, number one, executed a wholesale reprioritization of our resources, aligning the business with our growth priorities; number two, introduced new consumption models like subscriptions and ELAs that make it easier for customers to purchase and deploy F5 application services and software; number three, we have doubled down on security, including investments in WAF and bot mitigation; and number four, we have also brought new solutions to market, solutions like Cloud Edition and central management, orchestration and APIs, all of which have opened a new opportunities for us.","As a result, it is no longer accurate to view F5 through the narrow lens of a traditional ADC player. Our efforts to expand our reach and broaden our role have accelerated our software transition, and it is becoming evident in our performance. And this is true even before we factor in future software growth catalyst, including NGINX and F5 Cloud Services.","Today, F5 is a leader in an emerging and rapidly expanding multi-cloud application services space, a space that has arguably been underserved, which is why we are generating the kind of software growth we are. The multi-cloud application services opportunity differs from the traditional ADC opportunity in three fundamental ways. First, multi-cloud application services offer customers a much broader range of application services beyond load balancing and traffic management to include security, analytics, API management, application performance management and service mesh. Second, multi-cloud application services reach beyond the data center to public cloud and to containers. They are more versatile and agile. And as a result, they can support a much larger universe of applications. And third, multi-cloud application services are easier for customers to deploy, consume and manage.","It is clear that customers view F5 as a multi-cloud application services player. For instance, we continue to see security use cases driving software growth and accounting for a higher share of our overall product business. In particular, we continue to drive strong traction with our web application firewall, anti-bot and machine-generated traffic monitoring and blocking capabilities. During Q3 for instance, we secured our largest global web application firewall deployment yet with an international financial institution. This customer had been using multiple WAF platforms to protect its applications and selected F5 as their enterprise-wide WAF solution after thorough evaluation of a number of competitors.","Customers are also increasingly choosing F5 for our advanced capabilities in automation, orchestration and central management. We have been simplifying an increasingly complex combination of environment and sprawling deployments. During Q3, we secured a win with a government customer that selected BIG-IQ to manage a large and growing number of BIG-IP deployments. The customer also expects to deploy our Application Security Manager to manage web application firewall policies.","We also continue to see customers who are migrating to cloud environment, demanding the same level of application security and agility as they have in their data centers. This was the case with a U.S. enterprise customer that selected our Cloud Edition during the quarter. The customer expects the transition individual applications to cloud environments over time which made a Cloud Editions per app consumption and deployment model and ideal solution.","Finally, our new subscription consumption models continue to facilitate software growth across our customer base with both enterprise and service provider customers leveraging friction-free F5 services procurement and deployment. As an example, one of the ELAs closed in the quarter was with a large next generation mobile carrier in APAC. F5 5G-ready NFV solutions will address the needs of this customer\u2019s growing 4G mobile broadband consumer services. We will enable connectivity and security for Voice-over-LTE IMS services and enterprise IoT services.","Our solution reduces both capital and operating expenses, while increasing service agility with faster build, test and deployment cycles. We also simplified the network with software-based network functions and the ability to dynamically manage and orchestrate services. This enables the customer to tailor innovative services to subscriber preference and usage.","A word on our systems business and how it fits into our multi-cloud application services opportunity. We believe our systems business is seeing the effects of two factors. The first relates to the actions that we have taken to make it easier for our customers to consume F5 as software, reducing friction with new consumption models and sharing easier provisioning of software, simpler licensing management and models and generally reducing operating complexity. The second is that our customers are better able to operationalize and manage a virtualized infrastructure environment. And as a result a number of them are implementing software first policies. As a result of these two factors, we are seeing an accelerated shift in our product mix towards software.","Before we move to Q&A, let me talk to our combination with NGINX. With the NGINX acquisition completed on May 8, the teams have come together well, and we are executing our integration and value creation plan at a rapid pace. I will highlight progress on two key work streams in particular for this audience, one, go-to-market; and two, product integration.","First, on go-to-market. NGINX\u2019s sales team has worked hard to maintain the momentum of NGINX current offerings, and since close has been operating as an overlay to the F5 sales team, all of whom have been trained on NGINX. Our ability to bridge the gap between NetOps and DevOps is resonating with customers, and we are already seeing the power of our combined sales efforts. We estimate that the joint F5 NGINX and F5 initiated sales efforts have increased NGINX\u2019s net new Q4 pipeline by roughly 20%.","As an example, during Q3, we secured a joint F5 and NGINX win with an APAC-based international telecommunications provider. The customer needed a security solution for its private cloud distributed over 10 major city points of presence. They selected F5\u2019s software-based WAF to protect traffic ingress points. They selected NGINX for micro service security including protection for API gateways, cloud governance and reverse proxies.","The combined F5-NGINX solution resolved scaling issues in central controls and provided a consistent approach to security postures across the business while underpinning faster application delivery.","Briefly on F5-NGINX products integration. As planned, the F5 cloud-native product development team has been combined with the NGINX team, reporting to Gus Robertson. The teams have come together well and have made very strong progress on engineering and product integration.","As the first priority, the teams are moving quickly to converge NGINX\u2019s controller and F5\u2019s cloud-native application services platform. In fact, we expect the first release of a converged F5 NGINX offering within the next six months. We expect the converged F5 NGINX controller will be an accelerator for our NGINX business, expanding, both the addressable market and potential deal size by spanning a broader set of used cases across DevOps and Super-NetOps customer personas.","Overall, we are more enthusiastic than ever about the opportunities we are pursuing as a combined F5 NGINX team. In near-term, we are addressing a critical challenge for customers by bridging the NetOps, DevOps divide. The combined F5 NGINX provides the management ease of use features that traditional infrastructure buyers, including network buyers expect enabling F5 to cover the full spectrum of application and modernization needs.","Going forward, we believe applications will be increasingly disaggregated into smaller components, containerized and distributed across multi-cloud environment. NGINX is true software, ideal for this container-based DevOps environment, which means unparalleled agility and lower cost for our customers. We are confident that F5 and NGINX with our combined solutions and application expertise bring significant advantages to these cloud-native and containerized environments.","In summary, we are very pleased with the progress we are making overall, and we are confident we can continue to drive software momentum. One of the things we find most encouraging is that the software growth we have delivered thus far is largely from solutions that have been in the market for over a year, including our BIG-IP Virtual and Cloud Edition. As we look ahead, we see even more growth coming from new offerings, including our recently introduced SaaS platform, F5 Cloud Services and our combined F5 NGINX offerings. ","In closing today, my thanks to our partners, our customers and our shareholders, my thanks too to the entire F5 team, and especially to those working to ensure the combined F5 NGINX is as successful as we believe it can be.","With that, operator, we will now open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Alex Kurtz","Yes. Thanks guys for taking the question. Just on the impact from software which is really great to see, Francois, in the quarter. Any dynamics around how customers are consuming it and -- these comments are excluding NGINX for a second, but just, would it means for deals size? What does it mean for how the revenue is being recognized in the quarter and how we should think about that relative to systems business?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Hey, Alex, I'll take the first part and perhaps Frank can comment on the revenue recognition portion. So, the way that our customers are consuming our software is both via perpetual licenses and also via ELAs, which are typically three-year subscription agreements, and also one year subscriptions. The part of the business in software that has the fastest growth is in fact the subscription portion of the business because it gives our customers a lot more flexibility in terms of their own cost models and also the ability to consume the features as they go. So, we're seeing a lot of traction with these consumption models. And we're seeing a range of deals -- to your point around deal size, ranges from small kind of one year subscription that are typically multiple tens of Ks all the way to multimillion dollar, three-year enterprise license agreements.","Frank Pelzer","And Alex, with the adoption of 606 this year, the revenue recognition associated with a lot of subscription deals look exactly like what we would have had as perpetual deal in previous years. And so, instead of radically recognizing, you split out the value components and recognize that proportion of the revenue, which is frankly modeled after our perpetual. So, on a year-over-year comparison, it's very, very close to the same.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Paul Silverstein from Cowen. Your line is open. ","Paul Silverstein","I appreciate it. A couple if I may. First off, my math must be wrong, but on the software revenue, I'm coming out to $67 million in the current fiscal Q3, $65 million, if we exclude NGINX, this is what you said versus $45 million a year ago, that will work out to 42% year-over-year growth, not this 79% organic and 91% in total. Can you just help me out with the numbers? Because I mishear you all, it was 19% of product revenue a year ago and 27% in the current quarter, 26% ex-NGINX?","Frank Pelzer","So, I think, your number, Paul, for this year is correct, so the number for last year is not. It's much lower. I think it's something close to $34 million or $35 million.","Paul Silverstein","Did you all not do $239 million of product revenue last quarter in the year ago quarter?","Frank Pelzer","Yes, about 239.","Paul Silverstein","19% of $239 million is $45 million.","Frank Pelzer","19% that I referenced was last quarter, not a year ago quarter.","Paul Silverstein","My apologies. What was it in a year ago quarter?","Frank Pelzer","I think, it was -- I'm doing this off memory, but I think it was about 14%.","Paul Silverstein","14? All right. I'll come back to you after the call on that. Secondly, related to software NGINX in particular. I think, there's a view out there among most investors that NGINX displaces existing F5 platforms. And you all bought Silverline back when previous acquisition; you were working hard on it, if I recall the past two plus years. Can you just clarify whether NGINX totally displaced what you've done with respect to cloud platforms, whether it augments? And then, I've got a quick question on VMware, Avi.","Francois Locoh-Donou","Paul, thanks for the question. On NGINX, no, it does not displace either our perpetual software, sort of virtual edition offerings or Silverline. So, Silverline is essentially a managed security services platform for customers that want to consume WAF and DDoS and other security services with associated 24x7 support and leveraging our infrastructure to scrub the traffic and provide managed services to them. NGINX is a great platform for DevOps' environment, essentially injecting application services in the code of application logic. And it plays to a very different market than the market we have played in to-date, either with Silverline or with our Virtual Editions.","Paul Silverstein","Frank, before I ask the Avi question, what percent of your total revenue is now recurring?","Frank Pelzer","I would say, it\u2019s north of 70%, including the services fees.","Paul Silverstein","Do you know what it was a year ago?","Frank Pelzer","I\u2019d have to get back to you on that one, Paul. I don't have that off the top of my head.","Paul Silverstein","If you could, that\u2019d be appreciated. Now, for the Avi question. So, Avi was talking really good game before got acquired and it just got acquired by VMware. Obviously that wins resources, incumbency, customer base all things are needless to say. I know, it hasn't been a long time, but what are you seeing in terms of their success or lack thereof currently, versus whatever degree of success they were having previously in competition against you?","Francois Locoh-Donou","I know this one has gathered quite a bit of interest after the VMware acquisition. So, I am going to take the time to answer your question thoroughly and put a few facts on the table. So, Avi is essentially a software load balancer with the value proposition around nice analytics and nice GOE. [Ph] And where that value prop plays is in use cases where a customer would value the GOE [ph] and analytics over having a truly lightweight, truly scalable solution. And I\u2019ll tell you that this is actually a very small fraction of the market. And let me be specific about that. Historically, we have seen them in less than 2% of our deals. Even when we\u2019ve seen them, we win the large majority of these deals.","Even in the light -- the accounts that they have claimed to be lighthouse accounts for them, we\u2019ve looked at them, and F5 sales for the most part has 95% or more of the wallet share we ADC in these accounts. And then, going back to some of these lighthouse accounts, we\u2019ve seen a number of customers that are coming back to F5 from Avi because of lack of scale, lack of features or difficulty in getting the stock operationlized. So, that\u2019s where historically things have been. And I just wanted to make sure the facts were clear on that.","Now, VMware is a great company. We have a lot of respect for them, we do partner with them. And of course they\u2019re going to provide larger distribution for Avi. But where I think this is going to play out is the VMware Avi proposition I think will appeal to customers who\u2019ve gone all in on NSX and value, deep integration between NSX and a software load balancer, more than they value a true multi-cloud architecture and a broad range of application services. But again, I think that\u2019s going to be a fairly limited portion of the market.","So, let me get to how we\u2019re going to compete with -- in the space. The first piece around this, GOE [ph] and analytics, frankly we\u2019re neutralizing that with our controller, which as you heard in my prepared remarks is going to be released within the next six -- and this is the combined NGINX and F5 controller, which is a combination of the NGINX controller that\u2019s in the market and the work that F5 has done on our cloud application services platform, there\u2019s a lot of excitement about this combined platform.","But beyond just that, when we looked at the market and ended up buying NGINX, we\u2019ve always said this was an offensive play on the architectures of the future. And so, what we did is we looked at all the players in the virtual ADC space and we moved very quickly on what we believed was the most attractive asset in that space. And we chose NGINX because number one, they have the smallest footprint, which enables them to be inserted in micro services environment, they\u2019re a natural fit for these cloud-native micro services environments. Number two, they have proven scalability. They are the platform that everybody built on and the largest public clouds around the world are built on NGINX. And number three, they are a true platform that enables a broad range of application service including things like API gateway, app security, app server. They\u2019re not a virtual appliance with the sort of constraints and limitations. And so for all these reasons, NGINX is a natural choice for DevOps and application development teams. And that\u2019s why we chose NGINX and we\u2019re very excited with what the combination of F5 and NGINX will do in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Sami Badri","Thank you. So, I just had a quick question first on some of your cash, right, and where your cash balance is going to be by about mid-year 2020, or like at least the next fiscal year, basically two to three quarters from where we are today? I just wanted to understand maybe what the corporate plan was, what you're going to do with this cash balance? Are you going to consider more M&A? Are you going to potentially reinstate your cash buyback? Would you consider some other factors? Just to give us a bit of an idea on what you're going to do with this quickly escalating cash balance?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Sami. Look, I think, you can look at it this way. We are -- for now, we're placing significant emphasis and focus on augmenting our balance sheet and rebuilding our cash balance. But, we're going to continue to look at opportunities in the marketplace, whether it's potential M&A, or if the opportunity presents itself potentially more buyback. All these options are on the table. But in the very short-term, there is more emphasis on rebuilding our cash balance.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you. And then, my next question had a lot to do with, given the formation of some of the new offerings, F5 and NGINX are coming together and go to market with, would it would it be safe to assume that systems revenues specifically, or at least, the growth rate, or I guess you said, the declines could accelerate in probably six months out from today, given that the fair majority of the new offerings coming to market are more software-based versus hardware. And this is also probably a bit more correlated with the IT backdrop that you kind of see, see some metrics start to decelerate in a broader macro IT world, could you potentially see further deceleration of growth in the system side and then naturally see some acceleration further in the software side?","Francois Locoh-Donou","I don't necessarily think that the factors you mentioned, Sami, would lead to further deceleration on the hardware side, because there are also other sort of compensating factors when you look in 2020. I think, we should probably see a bit more from service provider around sort of capacity upgrades that are more naturally hardware driven. We also have some evolution of our own platforms, hardware platforms that would contribute to that. So, I think, there are factors on both sides of that equation. We've taken all of that into account when we have given our guidance for Horizon 1 around mid-single-digit growth. And I think we're still comfortable with that guidance.","Now, in that guidance, Sami, what our thought was that hardware would decline sort of low-single-digit to flat and software would go in the 35% to 40% range. Given what we've seen over the last six months, I think, it's fair to say that software is going to grow a little faster and hardware is going to decline, also a little faster than what we thought. But at this point, it's hard to give you a hard answer on the exact numbers for each. But overall, we're still seeing the balance of revenue growth is going to be what we thought.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you. And then, my last question has to do with the APAC deal regarding the carrier. And just to give us an idea, could you give us an idea on mix on software versus hardware in terms of what this carrier bought from you guys, just so we have like maybe some kind of illustration on what future carrier deals could look like?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Sami, it's a good example of a carrier that is moving to NFV in anticipation of the 5G rollout. And in this case, they bought software, essentially. It was a 100% software ELA with a number of virtual functions included in the deal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Rod Hall","I guess, I wanted to go back to this question of systems and systems decline and ask you what you think your market share position looks like for the quarter? Like, do you think you've maintained share? Do you think you lost share? And then, what would you expect to happen in the future, like the next few quarters? Do you think that within the systems business for ADC you\u2019ll be able to maintain share and just kind of track more performance or would you expect to kind of outperform the market itself?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Well, Rod, I think, if you look at -- first of all, I think, looking at just the ADC markets, the fairly narrow lens to look at when it comes to F5, now, as I said in my prepared remarks, I think, we're really becoming more of a multi9cloud application services player. And I think that's a broader opportunity. Now, that being said, if you\u2019re going to look with the lens of the ADC market, overall, hardware and software, I definitely think we're gaining share. Specifically in the hardware space, how we gained share this quarter, I can't tell, I can't answer that. And we won't know until market share reports come out in a couple of quarters. But, what I can tell you is there are things that we have done that have deliberate actions for my F5 that are transitioning some of our hardware business to software. And then, this includes things we do in our software offers to make them much easier to consume and remove all of the friction that exists in our customers adopting these solutions. It also revolves around the commercial offerings and the way we structured and changed our contracting structure. And it also revolves around the things we've done on go-to-market and the incentives we\u2019ve put in our field teams to proactively help customers who want to transition to software faster platform. And so, those actions are driven by us. Of course, there are effects that have to do with the market. And customers themselves wanted to implement software policies, and also wanting to have this multi-cloud portability, which is made easier with software. But, so, when you look at these two factors, that's what I think is driving the decline in systems, but some of which is driven by us.","And the last point Rod is, we have not been losing -- if that's kind of what you're getting to, we have not been losing hardware deals, if this is your question. We actually continue to be very, very happy with the win rate on our hardware deals.","Rod Hall","Yes. No, my -- the angle of my question was more you guys have been gaining share in hardware. And I wondered if you thought you would sustain that or whether you thought maybe you would match kind of the hardware market more, but that was kind of where I was coming from. And I also wanted to ask Francois, given the high software growth in the quarter, what -- can you give us any idea what you think software growth you did for the market or even better, it looks like over the next year, I mean, are you thinking that you can maintain this kind of ballpark in terms of growth, or is this a one-off or what sort of growth do you think is likely as we look out?","Francois Locoh-Donou","I think, Rod, if you look at the analysts\u2019 reports on ADC\u2019s software growth, excluding -- by the way, my comments here exclude ADC-as-a-service, which is largely the latest cloud offering. I\u2019ll come back to that in a moment. But if you exclude them, the analysts\u2019 reports so far are pointed to say 20%ish growth rate in the ADC software market. And so, if you look at that, we definitely believe that we are gaining a significant share in the ADC software market, even though our software growth isn\u2019t just driven by ADC, it\u2019s also -- it also has a strong component of security which has very strong software growth. So, that\u2019s kind of when you look at things today.","So, your question around can we maintain the software growth in the coming quarters? Look, I don\u2019t expect 90% software growth every quarter. And as I said before, I think we -- my expectation is that we are likely to do better than the 35% to 40% software growth that was put in our Horizon 1 guidance, in part because we have growth catalysts that haven\u2019t played out yet, specifically NGINX and also F5 Cloud Services, which is more of a sort of back half of 2020 contributor and certainly a contributor in Horizon 2. So, I think both of those catalysts that are yet to materialize for us. But overall when you combine that and what\u2019s happening with hardware I still think what we\u2019ve shared with you for Horizon 1 is about - overall aggregate revenue growth for Horizon 1 is correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kvaal from Nomura. Your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal","Thank you. Yes, I have two questions. I think, first Francois for you. There is a tremendous success in software this quarter, does put you on a much higher trajectory when it comes to that piece of the business. But, it doesn\u2019t seem as though your overall corporate growth rates have picked up, despite the software explosion. And I guess I would have expected there to be a little bit of uptick in the overall corporate growth rate, if you are expanding into standalone security et cetera, et cetera. So, I was wondering if you could offer some thoughts about that.","And then, Frank, on your side, the OpEx number that you are offering us for the September quarter is a little higher than we\u2019ve modeled, and there is integration of an acquisition, so I get that. But I was just wondering if you could help us understand where the OpEx is and where it might go over the course of the fiscal year, to the extent you can. Thank you.","Francois Locoh-Donou","I\u2019ll take the first part. And look, I think this is -- if you look at our overall revenue growth, this is playing out so far pretty much in line with what we have shared at AIM and what we have shared when we made the NGINX acquisition in terms of overall aggregate revenue growth. And I think we shared that in our Horizon 2, we expected this to pick up. And that\u2019s still our view. But for Horizon 1, I think when you look at the dynamics combined of the transition we have to go through as a company, starting from a large base of hardware and transitioning to a majority software business, that's how it's playing out. And I think the growth rate reflects that for the time being. ","Frank Pelzer","And Jeff, in terms of non-GAAP operating margin for the rest of our fiscal year, the coming quarter that we have is the rest of our fiscal year. And so, we're not providing any guidance at this point for FY20. But, as we talked about in the acquisition of NGINX, we expected that our non-GAAP operating margin in Horizon 1 was going to be in the range of 33% to 35%. This is absolutely in that range. And we did that with the anticipation of the expenses that were going to come on through the NGINX acquisition. So, that's exactly what we're seeing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Francois, I just wanted to start off with a more broader question on what are you seeing in terms of spending trends from enterprise customers? I think, last quarter, particularly there were few companies that had mentioned, given the uncertain macro, there was some kind of softness in signing large deals. What are you seeing on the ground? Are you seeing kind of any hesitation in signing those large deals at this point?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Samik. I would, maybe give you a couple of pointers. Overall, I think the macro environment is less healthy than it was a year ago. It's not -- I wouldn't characterize it as being kind of difficult but it is not as healthy as it was a year ago. Where we're seeing specific areas of softness, I would say, the UK and Germany and for us in Europe, and specifically the UK where uncertainty persists and we have seen a number of deals there being delayed or cancelled altogether. And I would also say specifically in hardware, we continue to see more scrutiny applied to hardware deals, of course, especially in companies that have software first policies. And so, that probably elongates the deal cycle, specifically for hardware deals.","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. Frank, I think, to quickly follow-up with a question on the software side. You had very strong sequential growth in the software revenues and you mentioned most -- a lot of that was driven by the security products. You also launched new SaaS offerings I think I believe in March. Can you just kind of help us understand if the sequential growth, how much contribution was there from the new SaaS offerings or if it\u2019s immaterial now, how much time do you think it takes to ramp those up so that they become material to your kind of outlook?","Francois Locoh-Donou","Yes, Samik. So, we are -- yes, you're right, we launched F5 Cloud Services, our SaaS platform in March, and introduced our first service on the platform, which is DNS-as-a-service. And we're now, in the process of launching our next set of service -- global server load balancing actually is next and is going to -- achieve pretty soon followed by WAF-as-a-Service, et cetera. So, we are -- where we are is we're very early days. And we basically just have the first service but even on the first service, we already have the first paying customers on the platform. And we have a large number of customers in trial and we expect that the pickup will accelerate as we introduce the new service, like GSLB and WAF. In terms of -- so this obviously did not contribute to the quarter. We don't expect it to be really material, certainly not in the next three quarters. SaaS businesses have a -- take a bit of time to ramp. But certainly going into FY21 and \u201822, when we get into Horizon 2, we would expect our F5 Cloud Services platform to be a meaningful contributor to our overall business and certainly to our software growth.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Meta Marshall","Great. This is Meta Marshall for James. Maybe first question, understanding that the 33% to 35% OpEx is kind of within the Horizon 1 that you had noted, but just also you kind of noted that change to the go-to-market. And so, I just want to get a sense of how much of this is just layering in NGINX versus how much of this is kind of -- is there a cost to kind of the change in go-to-market approach? And then, maybe the second question, just if you -- if we could get a sense of what is the impact of the purchase accounting on NGINX for kind of your forecast of just -- you've mentioned it's an $8 million contribution in the quarter. What would that have been without kind of the purchase accounting adjustment? Thanks.","Francois Locoh-Donou","Meta, I'll take the first part, and Frank will take the second part. On the 33% to 35% operating profit guidance for Horizon 1, Meta, this is mainly due to investments in our software platforms, largely NGINX and the investments we have to do there, some of F5 Cloud Services, but it's mainly NGINX. And it's not really about the go-to-market, it\u2019s a change in the go-to-market models. Even though we have increased the size of our go-to-market teams with the addition of NGINX, this is more about the platforms than a fundamental change in our go-to-market.","Frank Pelzer","I mean, in relation to the $8 million, that was a discussion about the contribution of NGINX next quarter. Without a purchase accounting, my assumption is that would be just approximately $10 million, maybe slightly more than $10 million next quarter?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is open.","Simon Leopold","I wanted to maybe come at the OpEx question a little bit differently. I want to reflect on the June quarter. Excluding the acquisition you had forecast, I believe, $275 million to $287 million, which would imply something like 60ish million coming from the acquisition. If you could maybe unpack what occurred in the June quarter and then help us understand what's maybe one-timeish, what's sort of ongoing from the acquisition, because obviously you're forecasting significantly lower operating expenses in September. So, I just want to make sure I understand the moving parts or components to operating expenses?","Frank Pelzer","Sure, Simon. So, all that $60 million, I think where you're getting that figure is when we talk about not just contribution from NGINX, but also some of our non-GAAP things that we have to split out. And that reconciliation can be found in the press release. And so, I'd point you to that. But some of the bigger items where there was a portion of the NGINX acquisition where it was part of the consideration but accounting makes us take that as an expense in the quarter and it was effectively a holdback or leave [ph] for key employees that was part of the deal negotiation. And so that was a large portion of that. There were some facility exit charges. And then the rest of what we would discuss would be the inflow of the new NGINX employees. So, all of that was anticipated as part of our guidance and our guidance going forward.","Simon Leopold","And so, the incremental expenses from NGINX by itself in terms of what is going to operating expenses is in kind of a $25 million to $30 million range per quarter?","Frank Pelzer","It\u2019s approx -- I think it\u2019s actually, Simon, a little bit less than that but it\u2019s not a number that we\u2019re splitting out for practical purposes. We\u2019ve already combined some of the teams together and it\u2019s not the way we are tracking the business.","Simon Leopold","Okay. And maybe just to pivot, in terms of the cash position, I understand this is I think the first quarter in more than 10 years that F5 has not bought back stocks, so sort of a significant break in the pattern. What is the cash level that you feel is necessary to run the business because it seems as if you certainly got adequate cash to do everything you\u2019d like and could still buyback stock. So, I guess, I'm trying to really, even if you\u2019re not ready to give us a number, if you can maybe explain your philosophy.","Frank Pelzer","Sure, Simon. I mean, for a long time, we\u2019ve had plenty of cash to run the business and have chosen to do share repurchase as opposed to other things that you can do with cash, including inorganic expansion. And so, we are adding back up that flexibility to continue to use our cash for multiple purposes and we\u2019ll be strategic with it. I can\u2019t say that there is ultimately one level where the cash balance has to be before go back in the market and repurchase shares. That could be this quarter. ","Simon Leopold","Could you maybe just follow that with your thought on instituting a dividend?","Frank Pelzer","Yes. We don\u2019t have any anticipation at this point of instituting a dividend. We think that that\u2019s actually not a great tax efficient way of redistributing cash to our shareholder base, and we\u2019d be much more off to do share repurchases as that vehicle to redistribute cash.","Simon Leopold","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Also, today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Eldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Eldridge","Thanks, Sharon. Welcome, everyone, to our conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Speakers on today's call are John McAdam, President and Chief Executive Officer; Andy Reinland, Chief Financial Officer. Other members of the executive team are also with us to answer questions following their prepared comments.","If you have questions following today's call, please direct them to me at (206) 272-6571.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in our quarterly release and described in detail in our SEC filings. Before we begin, I want to remind you that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.","Now I'll turn the call over to Andy Reinland","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. Results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013 came in above our expectations. Revenue for the quarter was $370.3 million, up 6% sequentially and 5% year-over-year, and above our guided range of $355 million to $365 million.","GAAP EPS was $0.86 per share, above our guidance of $0.80 to $0.83 per share. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.12 per share, also above our guidance of $1.06 to $1.09 per share.","For the third quarter of fiscal 2013, product revenue of $196.7 million represented 53% of total revenue, up 6% sequentially and down 5% from Q3 last year. Service revenue of $173.6 million grew 5% from the prior quarter and 19% year-over-year, and accounted for 47% of revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than 1.","Revenue from our Application Delivery Networking business was $366.8 million, and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $3.5 million.","By region, the Americas represented 58% of total revenue, up 6% versus Q3 2012. EMEA contributed 21%, a 4% increase year-over-year; APAC accounted for 15% of revenue, up 7% from a year ago; and Japan was 6% of revenue, down 7% from Q3 2012.","During Q3, the financial vertical accounted for 22% of total sales; telco was 21%; technology, 16%; U.S. federal government was 4% of sales, with total government accounting for 13%.","Three of our distributors each contributed more than 10% of revenue in Q3. Ingram Micro accounted for 15.6%, Avnet accounted for 13.9% and Westcon accounted for 11.2%.","GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.5%. GAAP operating expenses of $201.3 million were within our guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $176.3 million, also within our guided range. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 28.1%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 35.9%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 36.3%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.9%.","On the balance sheet, cash flow from operations in Q3 was $126.2 million, and we ended the quarter with $1.27 billion in cash and investments. DSO at the end of Q3 was 50 days. Inventories at quarter end were $18.3 million. Deferred revenue grew to $519.8 million, up 20% from a year ago. We repurchased approximately 633,000 shares of our common stock in Q3 at an average price of $78.90 per share, for a total of $50 million. Total headcount at quarter end was approximately 3,185 employees, a net increase of 30 from the prior quarter.","Now for our Q4 outlook. During the third quarter, revenue and earnings exceeded our guidance and our internal expectations despite continuing softness in the global economy. While we aren't assuming a material improvement in the macro environment in the near term, we believe there are a number of drivers specific to our business that will enable us to grow. With this in mind, we have set a revenue target in the range of $378 million to $388 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 83% range, including approximately $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","During Q4, GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $199 million to $206 million. This includes approximately $19.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.","I want to call out that our Q4 anticipated stock-based comp expense is considerably lower than both our Q3 expense and lower than our expected run rate going forward. To better align our annual review process for employees and our annual award date for RSU grants, we have chosen to move the award date from August 1 to November 1. This results in this lower expense in Q4 and a higher expense for Q1. We will give guidance for Q1 on our next call, as usual.","Also included in our GAAP operating expense target is an expected onetime $2.5 million charge related to the extension of certain subleases at our corporate headquarters. As this charge is nonrecurring in nature, it will also be excluded from our Q4 non-GAAP results.","We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 37%, and we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.93 to $0.96 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.17 to $1.20 per diluted share. We plan to increase our headcount by over 150 net adds during the quarter. We estimate DSOs will be in the upper 40-day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 million to $20 million, and we expect cash flow from operations in excess of $130 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our Q3 performance. In particular, we delivered solid sequential growth of 6% over Q2, with even higher sequential growth in overall sales bookings. The star of the quarter was the Americas region, which had very strong results, exceeding our internal forecast. In our previous quarterly call, we mentioned that the slowdown in orders we experienced late in the second quarter was most pronounced in the Americas region. I was especially pleased that our business in the Americas bounced back very quickly in Q3.","Our Asia Pacific region achieved its internal forecast, and our EMEA region missed its internal forecast, but not by a significant amount. Our Services business had another stellar quarter, exceeding revenue targets, as well as posting a solid increase in deferred revenue.","We saw a number of very encouraging trends in the quarter. Sales of the new products we have been introducing over the last 2 quarters continued to be very strong. In particular, we saw solid orders for the new entry-level BIG-IP 2000 Series platforms, which we introduced in Q2. This trend was similar to the strong traction we saw with the BIG-IP 4000 Series when it was introduced in Q1, and we continue to see this sales momentum accelerate through Q2 and Q3. These results bode well for our newest BIG-IP platforms, the midrange BIG-IP 5000 and 7000 series. Both these products were released at the end of Q3 and are available for shipping in the coming quarter.","We also announced a number of exciting new solutions last quarter and our latest TMOS release called Corona. These solutions make it easier for organizations to scale to the cloud, extend software-defined networking deployments, and add intelligence and programmability, via iCall, to IT environments. With a unified suite of physical and virtual products featuring F5's innovative ScaleN multi-tenant and clustering architecture, organizations can seamlessly scale operations to realize the full value of virtualization, cloud computing and on-demand IT.","With our newly-released iCall technology, F5 is setting the standard for increased programmability and control plane extensibility, providing the dynamic automation of event-driven policy decisions in the network.","We also continue to build momentum in sales of our software virtualization products. We have, by far, the largest portfolio of virtual software solutions in the market today. Now, with the TMOS Corona release, we have the industry's only virtual ADC solution that supports all of the top 5 hypervisor platforms, with up to 5 gigabits per second throughput. We plan to increase our performance leadership with these software solutions, and our goal is to deliver, by early next year, versions that will support greater than 10 gig. The combination of our industry-leading portfolio of virtualization products and our hardware-based solutions represents the broadest and most fully-featured array of ADC solutions in the market.","We are pleased with the growing awareness of our security solutions in the market. We experienced a record quarter for all major security solutions, including our Advanced Firewall Manager, Access Policy Manager and Application Security Manager. Additionally, we are expanding our relevance in the service provider market with these security solutions.","During the quarter, we extended our security solution to service providers by delivering the Gi firewall as part of our Application Delivery Firewall. F5's new offering is situated on the perimeter between the service providers' mobile network and the Internet, which is ideal for protecting both subscribers and networks from targeted attacks, such as DDoS threats, from a variety of sources. F5's Application Delivery Firewall delivers scalability and throughput characteristics far beyond traditional firewall architectures, and is now a key strategic solution in our growing intelligent application services framework portfolio.","Network World just published an independent review of our Advanced Firewall Manager, which validated F5's consolidated approach to security, and demonstrated the performance and scalability advantage that can be achieved with our ADC architecture.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see sequential growth this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, I am very pleased with the improvement in our sales last quarter, though clearly, we need to remain cautious given the current spending environment. However, I feel very optimistic about the future prospects for F5. Among the drivers of our business going forward, we continue to gain momentum in our initiatives to replace Cisco's installed base of ACE products. As I have mentioned in the past, we are seeing a clear pattern, where we replace ACE products with F5 platforms, offering customers additional functionality, including security, access control and application acceleration. We are experiencing a very high win rate with this approach and expect to see the continued growth of these opportunities in our pipeline.","In addition, there are a number of trends happening in the technology landscape that I believe F5 is uniquely positioned to take advantage of, including the growth of private and public clouds, mobility, complex global security threats, network function virtualization and software-defined everything.","We now -- we have now rolled out a complete new range of BIG-IP appliances, which increase our technology leadership and competitive position in the ADC market. In addition, our product roadmap includes some significant enhancements to our VIPRION platforms, including a second-generation blade for the popular VIPRION 2400. This new VIPRION 2250 blade will significantly increase the vCMP multi-tenant density by a factor of 5. We will also be offering a version of the current generation Victoria blade that doubles the vCMP density. Both blades will significantly improve the performance of our software modules when running with vCMP.","We have enjoyed great success in increasing the addressable market for our solution portfolio, especially in the security and service provider markets, with products like our Advanced Firewall Manager and the BIG-IP Carrier-Grade NAT and policy enforcement modules, and we will continue to expand and enhance the functionality of all these modules.","We also have a strong and growing pipeline of traffic -- of opportunities for our Traffix Diameter solutions for LTE rollouts. Our Traffix offering won the most prestigious informer [ph] award at the LTE World Summit last month, beating all our major competitors. We continue to help our customers address the growing mobility challenges with the industry's only consolidated solutions that accelerate application access across the client, network and data center. This is critical to delivering a superior end-user experience and on-demand content to any mobile device.","During the quarter, we announced the BIG-IP Application Acceleration Manager to enable our customers to accelerate applications wherever they reside, in the data center or in the cloud; and wherever they are delivered, on premise or to mobile devices. We also introduced a new centralized management platform, BIG-IQ. The initial release of BIG-IQ included our Cloud Manager for data center to cloud automation, and Security Manager to provide centralized support for our advanced firewall ACL programming. Our strategy is to have BIG-IQ provide centralized management, orchestration and automation for all BIG-IP modules, either as standalone software solutions and\/or as integrated systems. I'm convinced that F5 has the unique experience, products, application services, ecosystem and vision to drive the new emerging applications and network architectures. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners, and look forward to their continued support throughout the year.","We will now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions here. First, can you quantify how much of the business that slipped last quarter closed this quarter? And then perhaps from a broader point of view, can you talk a little bit about what you're hearing from both your enterprise and carrier customers with respect to their willingness to move forward with some of the larger million-dollar deals, where you had previously seen some weakness?","John McAdam","Yes. In terms of -- it's hard to really quantify in terms of percentage our actual numbers, but there's no doubt that we -- I think I said in the last quarter's call, Jess, that we had a strong start to the quarter, and I'm sure some of that was linked to the -- to some of the slippage in Q2, which obviously was pretty pronounced. I especially referred to some telco wins at the beginning of the quarter. Having said that, we saw that strength continue throughout the quarter, and the following 2 months were also very strong. So it's not like we saw a strong start slowing down. We didn't see that. We saw the opposite. There's no doubt that enterprise spending, in particular -- in North America I should say in particular, definitely picked up from Q2. And obviously, telco did as well worldwide.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then, John, if I look at your federal business, it seemed like that remained a little bit challenged in the period. Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about federal here and to what extent you are expecting some typical fiscal year-end behavior from the federal government?","John McAdam","No, absolutely, and there's no question that there's -- with what's going on in federal is well publicized, that you do need to be cautious. And the first 3 quarters of this year, we have seen bookings actually down year-over-year, not significantly, but down. Moving into the final quarter, having said that, we absolutely expect to see sequential growth, but I think we've taken a fairly cautious approach in terms of using -- taking that into account in our guidance.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And last question for me, but product growth appeared to perform much better in the quarter and what -- with most of the new products now in the market, I guess the question is, at the high end of your guidance, would you expect your product growth to be positive in Q4? Or do you think this may take another quarter?","John McAdam","We're not going to take a specific answer to that. It's clearly, by a mile, our #1 priority. I think we have a lot of good opportunities to get the product growth accelerating here with the product refresh, which is a big deal and is now completely out there in the market, the ACE opportunity, security, LTE rollouts. So clearly, that's our main focus.","Jess L. Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And, John, before I let you go, I didn't hear the answer on the million-dollar deals. Did you see any improvement?","John McAdam","Oh, sorry. I didn't answer it, which is why. We saw a pretty similar -- the million-dollar deals pretty similar to the previous quarter. I mean, if there's any good news in this, it's that the comparisons now are effectively okay. But we did see it pretty similar to the previous quarters that we've seen. We did see, from accounts in general, an uptick in sales. So maybe not all million-dollar deals, but from some of our larger accounts, we saw them starting to spend more.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wanted to talk to you about the guidance. Did you hold back at all in your guidance for maybe some of the deals that slipped into -- in terms of the sequential growth rate? Or do you feel like you're being conservative with regard to the sequential growth rate you guided for on the top line? And what I mean is, is if some stuff was pushed into the quarter from the last quarter, did you hold back on your guidance at all? And how can we gauge your conservatism given the environment?","John McAdam","I mean, we took -- I believe we've taken a reasonably conservative approach in terms of the -- one of the key factors we look at is the close rate. And from a close rate perspective, we've taken a mix of the previous 2 quarters. That includes obviously the tough quarter of Q2. So I think it's been reasonably conservative. But I think that's absolutely appropriate, to be cautious given what we saw in Q2.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And how did you feel about the competitive environment as we went throughout the quarter? If I looked right, the Citrix numbers looked pretty strong in networking. And did you notice anything different? Did it ease? And are you still not really seeing them other than in the desktop virtualization market, et cetera? Was there anything there?","John McAdam","No. That's a really good question. We -- well, first of all, we're definitely seeing strength of the new products we're introducing, and I'm absolutely convinced we'll see strength for the 5000 and 7000 are now available as well. So we're seeing strength there. And I think that momentum will continue because that product refresh we did wasn't just a simple box refresh. That's all about -- we introduced architecture, we introduced new modules. We introduced VLAN architecture. We introduced vCMP. And so this is a big product refresh. I think it's going to help with competitive advantage. But to be specific, absolutely, by a mile, Citrix is our #1 competitor, but we -- look, we had a -- we did a lengthy quarterly business review with our North American sales management on Monday. We had them all here in Seattle. The competitive win rate is as strong as it's ever been. It's very, very strong, as I mentioned, in the ACE replacement space. Our security business is strong. I think our competitive position is great. On the VDI side, we just -- where we get a chance, we have a good win rate. But clearly, especially with Citrix-only VDI solutions, I'm sure there's a lot of deals we just don't see there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel.","Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. John, last quarter, I think with the AFM modules, I think they were out for just 1 month. You had mentioned 50 deals in the last sort of month of the quarter. Any updates on that metric as far as the AFM modules are concerned? And then on the virtual appliances, you obviously spent some time talking about that. But just broadly, how should we sort of think about -- as it relates to your ADC sales going forward, as we see the shift happening on the virtual side, it will probably take some time. But just trying to get a gauge as how we should be thinking about your broader ADC sales within that context?","Manuel F. Rivelo","San, this is Manny. Just thought I'd answer both questions here. So first of all, on the AFM module, we saw -- as you know, we announced the module last quarter, and it was out in the market for approximately 4 to 6 weeks. We saw huge growth on that module this quarter. We're very, very pleased with the momentum it's picking up inside the market, and we continue to see, across all verticals and across all theaters, good traction on that module. So we're excited. It's early, but progress has been phenomenal so far. And that's both in enterprise and service provider use cases, so we're pretty well rounded there. And then real quick on the virtual, just to give you some insight, you're absolutely correct. I mean, there's a lot of talk in the industry about it all moving to potentially virtual solutions. What we're seeing from the customer base is that really, it's a hybrid solution set. There's a need for virtual solutions, and there's a need for physical hardware solutions, and it has to do really with placing the network and the architecture you're looking to deploy. What we've been doing on the virtual solution side is that we've been increasing our performance capability, as John pointed out, and we have solutions from 200 meg, all the way up to 5 gig, highest throughput in the industry, across all of our modules, across all of the industry hypervisors. And as we look forward in the coming quarters, you'll continue to see us improve on that performance, both going upstream, higher throughput, and downstream to lower throughput. So our intent is to have all of our modules across all physical, as well as all virtual appliances in the industry, giving you the flexibility from an architecture point of view. And we're actually seeing that also in the IDC most recent data that was just published in Q1, where we saw a great, great traction also there from a market share perspective.","Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. And just one quick follow-up on the AFM stuff. Any metrics that you care to share, like this -- kind of last quarter, I know it was out for only 4 to 6 weeks, but any metrics that you might be able to share?","John McAdam","This is John again. I'll take the negative side of it. No, we're not going to be specific on that, and we haven't been in any other modules. We gave some numbers on the very first quarter release of the product, but the growth was quite significant, still a small percentage of our business, but we'd expect it to continue to grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to expand on the question around the virtual solutions. So, can you help us understand how the economics work for F5? If you look at an analogous product, hardware vis-a-vis software, what's the delta in terms of ASPs? What's the delta in terms of gross profit dollars? I mean, anything you could kind of help us with there, that would be great.","Andy Reinland","So you're asking just on a deal structure, what it could mean revenue-wise and margin-wise comparatively with hardware?","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, and that's exactly right. So if I trade a hardware appliance sale for a virtual sale, how does that economic impact play out through your numbers?","Andy Reinland","So what we've seen so far, and this speaks to what Manny was saying, is that when we do sell software, via ADCs, a lot of times, the revenue difference is made up in multiple versions of the software version. So we haven't seen a big difference. We have seen stronger gross margin because a big component of that is software. But at least to date, as we've looked at it, it's been fairly neutral.","John McAdam","And we've seen a lot of hybrid sales as well, where you've got a combination of systems and software-only solutions. Remember, we keep pressing this point because it's a big differentiator. We can basically manage software and systems identically and integrated and\/or standalone, and that's pretty flexible for the customer. But there's no 1-for-1 on this. It's a combination of architecture approaches. In terms of is there going to be a long-term trend? Maybe. But wow, it will be very, very long-term in nature.","Manuel F. Rivelo","And let me just add. This is Manny, one more comment just to add here. I alluded to the architecture trade-offs. Usually, when you see a hardware sale, what you're quite often seeing is a consolidation inside that device of multiple applications or services sitting behind that device. And sometimes, when you see virtuals, what you're seeing is virtual per application. So it's more of a scale out, horizontal scale. So to the point of, is there a revenue shift or -- obviously, Andy talked to the margin. But is there a revenue shift? No. It's just a different architecture, where you have less consolidation, you have more single tenancy with the app -- with the virtualized addition provided for that application.","Operator","Our next question comes from Troy Jensen of Piper Jaffray.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A quick question for Andy here. So gross margins, down slightly here. I don't want to nitpick here. But historically, you guys have been able to expand your margins with revenue growth. So I'm just curious if you can explain why we've seen a downtick in gross margins the past 2 quarters? And is it pricing or is it mix?","Andy Reinland","Yes, that's -- actually, if you go back to Q1, we were really at an all-time high, and that was driven by software, and we talked about that then. But you're right, over the last 2 quarters, what we've seen, as we've brought out these new platforms, getting our depot stocked, just the product transition, we've seen what we believe are short-term increasing costs around that, and we see that reflected in the gross margin results. As you heard from our guidance, we expect that to come back in this coming quarter a bit.","John McAdam","And just the other point, it's not quite connected to the question, but obviously, you saw our operating margins increased this quarter, driven by revenue, and we'll give more data about that in October in terms of how we see it for the year and moving forward. But I'm just going to take this opportunity, when you're looking at the year coming, that we will see seasonality in the December quarter. We've seen it before. I just want to put that stake in the ground while the discussion on margin reminds me to.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes, okay. Perfect. And then how about, Andy, just one more here on service revenues. Historically, that's grown 30% year-over-year, very healthy clip. Now it's sub-20%. So I'm just curious what your thoughts are for services growth going forward?","Andy Reinland","Yes. That's going to go back to John's comment that our #1 priority is product revenue growth. And so I think what we've seen over time is that service revenue growth is going to slow if our product growth doesn't take off again. So they are linked. It's just over a more elongated period. So I'm hoping we're going to start to see that shallowing out, and we'll talk more on the next call about what we think next year will look like. But definitely tied to product revenue growth. That's got to be the priority.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","John and Andy, I trust by virtue of your guidance that the answer is self-evident, but last quarter, you commented about the start of the new quarter, so similar question to you now in terms of the start of your fiscal fourth quarter. Again, I trust per the guidance that it's been a strong start. And then I've got 1 or 2 other quick questions.","John McAdam","Yes, I knew I would get asked this. The only reason I -- we never normally give an update on the month, certainly at the day of the call. We had a pretty big miss in Q2, and that's why we decided to do it. And so I'm not going to do that. Having said that, absolutely, we take into account the first 3 weeks and, more importantly, the quarterly reviews that we have when we give our guidance. So that is baked into that, yes.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","John, I understand, and I suspected that was the case, but I still wanted to ask. A couple of other quick items. One, I know it's very early, but the carriers have made a lot of noise about network function virtualization. I know you addressed it in your prepared remarks, but is there any insight you could share with us at this point as to how you play in an NFV world? And also, I know it's still small, but you mentioned it's growing. Can you -- are you -- is virtual anywhere close to 5% to 10% of total revenue at this point? Is that something you'd care to comment on?","John McAdam","Yes. We're not going to be specific. It's a small number, still virtual. We've talked virtual. We're talking about -- we're not talking about our total modules, software modules, which obviously is added on to that. But the virtual number still is reasonably small, although we've seen some fairly big deals happening and it is linked to the architecture. In November, at the Analyst Day, and we'll talk about it again in October, we're going to go through this in a lot of detail. I think people will be impressed at where we are in terms of what we think our strengths are in this type of environment and what our roadmap looks like and what our product portfolio competitiveness is like. So we'll talk more about that as we move forward. But, Manny, do you want to just comment right now?","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes, I could comment on network function virtualization. I mean, we're well positioned because, as we pointed out before, we support all of our modules across all major hypervisors, and network function virtualization is really just the service providers looking at moving from hardware devices into virtual devices, meaning devices sitting on hypervisors on a cost [ph] platform. So we've been taking our solutions into the marketplace. We're working with various service providers. We're part of the ETSI standard and working in that working group to make sure they continue to shape that. So it's early days, but you'll see that beginning to develop in the service provider arena because they, themselves, like in data centers, want to take advantage of software where applicable. So we think we're well positioned, and it'll shape up in the next 18 months, I think, industry-wide.","John McAdam","And meanwhile, in between, when we talk to service providers about our strategy of consolidation, where we talk about being able to do policy enforcement management, DPI, Carrier-Grade NAT, traffic steering, a whole range of areas where they have separate boxes right now to do these functions, if we can do them within the same chassis or within the same appliance, they'll love that strategy. So I think Manny's 18 months is probably spot on. But meanwhile, the consolidation approach we have is very attractive to them.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Last one from me. Andy, average deal size. Can you comment on that?","Andy Reinland","Yes. Our average order size has settled out really at about 100,000, and that's been consistent for the last 3 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger of JMP.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Yes, a couple of things. First off, Japan seems to be slow still. Can you discuss the competitive dynamics in Japan?","John McAdam","Yes. I think we've said this in the past. I mean, we're -- I think we actually gained market share in the -- I can't remember which quarter it was, but a recently published quarter, which is obviously a reasonable sign. But there's no question that A10 have done well there, obviously with one particular very, very large telco that is an obvious one, in particular. They had some Carrier-Grade NAT capability that we have caught up with, and we've got every intention of staying feature-rich there. So I think moving forward, we're in good shape. The biggest issue that we've seen in Japan actually is, we definitely saw an increase in business after the tsunami hit. I think there's no question about that now, as data centers were built, et cetera. And so when you look at the year-over-year, we've had a pretty tough comparison. That actually finishes moving forward, next quarter. So, yes, I think you'll start to see a better year-over-year-type result coming from that geography.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the hiring, it sounds like you've accelerated some of your hiring. I think in the past, you've targeted about 100 additions, and you said 150. Is that just an anomaly for Q4? Or are you getting more aggressive on the hiring front?","John McAdam","I think you're going to see us more aggressive with the way things are shaping up here. I mean, frankly, if we can beat the 150 number, we'll absolutely go for it and try and do that. It's across the company, we're going to do that. If things go the way we expect, what you'll see is with fairly aggressive hiring numbers next year as well.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Is that biased toward sales now that you have the new products? Or where are those resources going?","John McAdam","Well, product development is really critical. We've got -- again, we'll talk about this architecture that we have with our integrated architecture, our BIG-IQ, the areas we're doing there. So product development is very high. Service is always high for us because of customer satisfaction. Consultancy is very big for us as well. That has some margin implications, but that's life, and it definitely drives product revenue. And of course, sales as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Thompson of FBR.","Scott Thompson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a question about deferred revenues. As you guys move into a virtual-type platform, should we expect deferred revenues to start to ramp? I noticed they were up a bit the last couple of quarters. Let's talk about that. And then second question on service provider. You made some comments about security starting to get some traction there. Can you give us some more specifics? Is that U.S.-based, or is it elsewhere?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So I'll take the first part of the question on the deferred revenue. Actually, we have very little product in our deferred revenue, at least now. It's mainly annual maintenance contracts. As we evolve our models going forward, we may change to something where we build up deferred revenue. But as of now, we don't have anything of note in there.","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes. And then this is Manny, just to comment on the security and the service provider arena. We're seeing traction in all theaters. We're working with tier 1 operators in all 3 theaters right now. The general problem that they're struggling with is actually keeping up with the growing demand for bandwidth on the mobile networks, specifically with the movement to 4G, and protecting everything from a DDoS all the way to an application vulnerability. So we're well suited for that. As a matter fact, I think you saw the article that might have come out earlier this week from Network World, which talks a little bit about our performance, and that was a mid-range box. It's not even the high end of the market. So we're working with these operators. It's early, but it's quite often more than just security, to the point that John made before. While we're sitting in that footprint, they're not only looking at firewall capabilities, but they're looking at Carrier-Grade NAT capabilities, potentially policy enforcement capabilities. So it's a whole new re-architecture that some of the providers are looking at, and others are just looking at how to scale security needs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan of Juda Group.","Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division","I had 2 questions. First, on the telco side, just looking back at last quarter, the lumpiness and the bounce-back. Was it just, you think, timing of deals? Or is there any change in kind of buyer behavior as they're looking at new architectures? And how do you expect that trend going to the next few quarters? And my other question was on new product contribution for the new appliances. How long do you think we'll see the ramp before customers convert over from your traditional appliances to the newer appliances?","John McAdam","Yes. So on the service provider deals, no, timing of deals, no major change there. I mean, clearly, there was a number of companies talked about telco being slow in the first half, and it seems to have definitely picked up, and that's what we saw. And it was global in nature as well. So nothing -- no significant change there. The only change we have seen in telco is -- in terms of change, is we've definitely got a growing and growing pipeline. I mentioned this in my introduction, pipeline of LTE Diameter opportunities. That's definitely a positive change for us. And then in terms of the -- I think I heard the question correctly, the new appliances that we brought out -- what we're seeing is that we introduced the product and the first few quarter of shipments, we see a fairly strong momentum happening, and we saw that with everything so far. And we're hopefully going to see the same with the 2 new ones, the 5000 and the 7000. So they have become a dominant product sale pretty quickly, actually.","Natarajan Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group, Research Division","If I could clarify, John, you made a comment on seasonality for December. Was that in context of revenue or gross margin that made that...","John McAdam","Well, that was in context of revenue, specifically. And obviously, by definition, that affects operating margin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ehud Gelblum of Morgan Stanley.","Stanley Kovler - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is actually Stan Kovler for Ehud. I just wanted to lead off with a question about the fed. It seems like that came back fairly nicely this quarter. Is that something that we should expect to continue to improve going forward? And I also just wanted to ask, in terms of the outlook, what you think going forward about the sequential growth next quarter. Do you think that the product revenue -- should we expect that to come back to the 2012 run rate on product revenue on a quarterly basis? Does it sound right to you?","John McAdam","Yes. On the last question, we're not going to answer that. I mean, it's our #1 priority, and we think we've got a whole lot of things in place that, if we execute properly, we can make things happen. But no, we're not going to be specific about timing, et cetera. I think we have a lot of good growth drivers, I've gone through a number of times here. So on the fed, our fed business actually, I think, was -- it was 4%, which is on the low side of our fed business in the quarter. So I don't know, when you say bounce back quite well, I'm not -- I don't quite understand that. As I did say in the previous question, we do expect it to be up sequentially, but I think we've been reasonably cautious, given the visibility.","Stanley Kovler - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just from a big-picture standpoint, how do some of the products fit into new business wins, the cloud providers? And what's going on with the tech vertical in general? Are you getting some of that momentum back?","Manuel F. Rivelo","The question is how did our products fit into the...","John McAdam","The cloud providers.","Manuel F. Rivelo","The cloud providers? Quite well. As we mentioned before, we support all the virtual additions. If you're a cloud provider and you want to deploy your software in those environments, we do that today. We work very well with Amazon, we work very well with Rackspace and others that are out there. So from that point of view, we're seeing good traction, good momentum, and we're looking to continue to accelerate that this year. So there's no issue whatsoever there.","Stanley Kovler - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And on -- just last question on the headcount additions, as a follow-up. Is that regional based? Or, on the product development side, that's mainly focused on just U.S. and continuing to develop new products? As a corollary to that, we saw that one of your biggest competitors made a pretty large security acquisition yesterday. And so just curious how you feel about product development and security in general? Is it something that you're going to continue to address internally? Or do you feel like there might be some other technologies out there or other companies that may be of interest to you, to add into the portfolio?","John McAdam","Yes. On the hiring, first of all -- I mean, it's global in nature, and especially when you look at the sales and service organization. We have a pretty global product development organization as well, but they are the 3 main priorities that we'll be focusing on. So, yes, probably in product development, it'll be more U.S.-based, because that's where the majority of the people are. But generally, it's a global approach that we have. Regarding security, it's a -- we think security is probably our biggest growth driver. I mean, product refresh is bread and butter, and that's spread across everywhere. But security is probably the biggest. We have a very significant development focus on security. We're always looking in the industry. That's what we've done for years and years. Now if we see something that we think can get to market faster than we can develop, we're not shy about making it happen. But that's just business as usual as far as we're concerned.","John Eldridge","Thank you all for joining us. We look forward to seeing many of you out in the conference circuit over the next quarter and look forward to catching up with you again on -- at the end of October.

These forward-looking statements involve uncertainties and risks that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized on our quarterly release and described in detail in our SEC filings. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.","I will now turn the call over to Andy.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jason. For the third quarter of 2017, our revenue of $518 million was up 4% from the third quarter of fiscal 2016, but below our guided range of $520 million to $530 million, driven primarily by lower-than-expected results in EMEA and Japan. GAAP EPS of $1.52 per share was above our guidance of $1.47 to $1.50. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.03 per share was within our guidance of $2.01 to $2.04 per share.","Product revenue of $235 million in the third quarter was up 2% year-over-year and accounted for 45% of total revenue. Service revenue of $283 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 55% of total revenue.","Looking at revenue by theater, Americas accounted for 57% of the total, up 6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2016. EMEA, which represented 23% of revenue, grew 4% from the third quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 15% of revenue and grew 3% year-over-year. And Japan revenue representing 4% of the total declined 8% from a year ago.","Sales to enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 14%, including 6% of total sales from U.S. federal. In Q3, we had three greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which represented 19.1% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 16.8%; and Tech Data, representing 12.2%.","Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82.7%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.1%. GAAP operating expenses of $289 million were within our target range of $286 million to $296 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $250 million. GAAP operating margin was 26.9%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 31.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 30.3%.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was $163 million. In Q3, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $129.37 for a total of $150 million. $324 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.","We ended the quarter with over $1.2 billion in cash and investments. DSO at the end of Q3 was 51 days. Inventories were $31 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $944 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,515 employees, flat with the prior quarter.","As we review Q3 and look to the fourth quarter, in Q3, we saw iSeries adoption rates continue to previous appliance refreshes, which resulted in healthy sequential growth from total appliance sales. Security continues to be a driver of our overall business, both the Gi firewall in telco and application security in on-prem and cloud environments. Also, we saw no change in the competitive landscape during the third quarter and our win rates remained strong and in line with historical levels.","Conversely, we're not assuming immediate improvement within the EMEA theater. We believe the short-term spending environment remains negatively impacted by Brexit, forthcoming GDPR implementation and general macro uncertainty. Our current federal pipeline and sales activity are in line with seasonal expectations. However, there is uncertainty in the timing with the federal budget that could impact sales cycles.","And while we are very encouraged with the trends and sales with our customers that have more mature cloud architecture strategies in place, we continue to see delays in projects with those customers who are still evaluating their application architectures as they relate to hybrid and public cloud deployments. With these comments in mind, for the fourth quarter, our revenue target is $530 million to $540 million.","GAAP gross margin is anticipated at or around 83%, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84.5%.","For Q4, we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $283 million to $293 million, including approximately $38.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.64 to $1.67 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $2.20 to $2.23 per share.","We believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $200 million. Product revenue growth remains our number one priority, and we remain committed to delivering strong profitability and cash generation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Fran\u00e7ois.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. While we delivered year-over-year growth of 4% and strong profitability in the third quarter, our product revenue performance fell short of our expectations. The reacceleration of product revenue growth remains our number one priority, and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver on this over the coming periods.","Customer adoption of our recently introduced products remains strong and our revenue is increasingly coming from more diverse sources, including Virtual Editions, public cloud solutions, and application security.","On the overall demand environment for our core ADC solutions, the cloud continues to cause some degree of pause while certain customers evaluate their application architectures and deployment options.","Our conversations indicate many organizations are still trying to assess the true benefits of the cloud balanced against the true cost. Additionally, some customers remain undecided about how to work with large cloud service providers and avoid lock-in with one vendor, which we believe is increasing the exploration of hybrid and multi-cloud deployment.","Over the long term, we believe the complexities and security risk of multiple deployment environments play to our strength. They require the types of advanced application services we excel at providing.","As customer needs evolve, we are accelerating our efforts to meet their requirement for our solutions across various deployment environments and consumption models. While we have already made significant progress on these fronts, we recognize the need to move even faster to ensure we provide our secure application services in the way customers demand now and in the future.","Taking a closer look at third quarter results, the EMEA theater again underperformed relative to our expectations. Conditions in the UK did not improve during Q3, and we saw headwinds in this market from a further slowdown in government activity.","In addition, we are seeing several European-wide regulatory initiatives around data protection and usage creates short-term disruption in spending. We have taken a number of steps to ensure our resources are properly aligned to growth opportunities across territories and customer verticals.","Our security solutions delivered solid growth in the third quarter. We saw strength in our firewall offerings into the service provider vertical where we believe we continued to gain market share. We saw additional purchases from a large U.S. service provider who is deploying VIPRION Gi firewalls across their mobile switching centers, as they provide significant scalability and performance over the customer's legacy vendor.","In North Africa, a major telecom provider building out its LTE network is utilizing a VIPRION deployment to support multiple features, including Gi firewall, DDoS and application security. Within the enterprise vertical, attach rates for security modules remain high, and we had a number of wins around our web application firewall offering. This includes a large North American IT services management company that is implementing our WAF solution across iSeries appliances to protect against layer 7 attacks and provide compliance with security audits and PCI.","As mitigating application level threats and ensuring policy consistency takes on increasing priority for our customers, security has become a key driver for F5. As it relates to supporting customers that have begun to make architectural decisions around moving workloads to the cloud, we are encouraged by the early signs. It is clear from our conversations with customers that they value the programmability and flexibility that TMOS and iRules provide.","During Q3, we completed a deal with a large U.S. federal agency as a part of their process to lift and shift some of their applications to the public cloud. This involved the purchase of a significant number of VE licenses as the customer transitions some of their applications from our hardware ADC platform to our virtual offerings, both on-prem and in the public cloud.","During the third quarter, we introduced several exciting new solutions aimed at helping our customers manage their applications in a multi-cloud world. These solutions give customers the freedom to deploy any application anywhere with consistent application services and enterprise-grade security.","Key new releases included BIG-IP Virtual Edition for the Google Cloud Platform. This release means that organizations can now deploy F5 services in all major public clouds with Bring-Your-Own-License offers for instances ranging from 25 megabits per second to 5 gigabits per second.","Container Connector supports the easy deployment of application services in containerized environments and simple integration of capabilities into management and orchestration systems. Application Connector inserts application services from the edge of the public cloud and securely connects any public cloud provider to the customer's interconnection or data center. In the case of AWS, Application Connector can automatically discover workloads for application services insertion.","I want to take a moment to share some of my impressions from my first four months at the company and my thoughts on the significant long-term opportunity I see for F5. Since joining in early April, I have spent considerable time meeting with customers across verticals and theaters. Throughout these conversations, customers told me F5 is a key partner as they evolve their application architecture to support emerging hybrid and public cloud environments. They value F5's ability to enable consistent application services across environments, ensure applications are fully secured and compliant and protect them against cloud lock-in.","One of the changes we are seeing is the demand to consumer technology in multiple deployment models, including private cloud, public cloud, software-only and various subscription and pay-as-you-go models. I believe these new environments and consumption models for application services will create a meaningful opportunity for growth in our market. As a company, we have already begun to refocus our energies around supporting the varied application deployment environments and consumption models our customers are demanding.","This focus is evident in our recent product introductions that help customers better navigate a multi-cloud world. It is also evident in the new subscription pricing for Virtual Editions we introduced at the beginning of July. By putting more structure around our subscription offering, we can better engage customers across a spectrum of potential consumption models. Improving the ease of consuming our solutions is expected to open new customer opportunities and we are encouraged by the initial response.","We are at the early stages of an evolution from a largely appliance-based ADC company selling perpetual licenses to a diverse secure application services company with a breadth of hardware, software and subscription-based services. While this evolution will not happen overnight, ensuring we are taking the necessary steps to remain the clear leader in delivering application services is where I am devoting my time and where we as a company will be devoting our development and go-to-market resources.","Before concluding, I want to recognize the contributions of Julian Eames, F5's Chief Operations Officer and Executive Vice President, who will be retiring after the end of our fiscal year. Julian joined F5 in 2000 when the company boasted just over 500 employees and became part of the executive team in 2001.","Julian has been a driving force behind developing a world-class services organization that now stands at over 1,200 people and generated over $1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2016. Julian will remain actively involved in his day-to-day operations until his retirement, and we have begun the process of finding his successor. I know I can speak for the entire F5 team in expressing my gratitude for Julian's contributions and wishing him the very best in his retirement.","Finally, I'd like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter.","With that, we'll now hand the call over for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions, actually. First, for Fran\u00e7ois, I was hoping you could provide some additional details to help us understand. How come at this point in the cycle we aren't seeing better product growth? And given the shift to workloads to the cloud likely to present a longer term market dynamic, I was hoping you could help us understand what gives you confidence product growth is likely to improve over the next few quarters. What needs to happen for that to occur?","And then, for Andy, in the past, you suggested that if product growth didn't reaccelerate with the current cycle that you would potentially consider other ways to unlock shareholder value. So I was hoping you could update us on to what degree now might be the time to look at more aggressively buying back stock, paying a dividend or potentially even considering strategic alternatives.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jess. Look, I'll take the first one on product growth. So where we are in the iSeries refresh cycle, we're about three quarters into the cycle. And typically, in the past, we've seen an acceleration in product growth once we are further into the cycle and iSeries represent a higher percentage of our sales.","We are tracking \u2013 as you look at the percentage of our appliance sales that are represented by iSeries, we're actually tracking to prior growth cycles or prior product cycles. And that's part of what gives us the confidence that we can have product revenue growth in coming quarters.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. And Jess, on unlocking shareholder value, I think it's fair to say that, as an organization, we've always been open to looking at different ways to give back be it buyback or dividend, but we've always considered our self a growth company. And so, specific to your question why \u2013 is now the time or not the time, I think you'll find that under Fran\u00e7ois' leadership, we'll continue to be that organization that assesses that.","But, to his comments, we still feel very positive about our future opportunities in this space. And as we look out at our discussions with our customers, we talk a lot about this pause impact that we're seeing and we've seen that in previous cycles. We still think these complex workloads demand the services that we bring to the table and we continue to attack the market with that in mind.","So, will we look at those alternatives? Definitely, and we'll continue to discuss them with the board. And I think you have to assess everything that also comes at you at the same time. But our focus is on driving the top line growth as we said, still managing for strong profitability and cash flow and executing to the best of our ability with these opportunities in front of us.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you perhaps touch to what degree the shift to virtual is changing the dynamics of this product cycle and our legacy offerings falling off faster than we've seen in the past product cycles, because historically, as we moved into this point in the cycle, you are seeing acceleration. So I'm just trying to kind of understand what's holding it back, given the iSeries is doing well.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, Jess. I think the shift to virtual isn't necessarily what we think is holding us back. As it relates to this quarter in particular, we didn't have the performance that we expected out of a couple of geographies; EMEA and Japan, but EMEA more specifically. And that's fairly specific to some macro environment challenges in the EMEA, some to do with the regulatory environment, specifically in the UK and more pronounced in the finance vertical.","So that's what really, for us this quarter, led us to not be in the range that we expected in revenues. But, generally, our appliance sales are tracking as we expected it to be. We continue to see growth in our Virtual Edition offerings, both because of private cloud and now increasingly because of public cloud. And as we get further into the cycle, our expectation is to continue to see product revenue growth.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","And Jess, in our comments last quarter, we talked about, we think of the timing of the rollout when we compare it to past cycles, we kind of message, we think if this is going to take off the way we've been talking about the end of Q4 and then going out stretching over the next 18 to 24 months. So we think it's playing out as we anticipated it would. We do see some headwinds that might mute the impact of it in this quarter, but we see the uptake in line with previous cycles. We like what we're hearing from our customers and our salespeople about how the new platforms are being received. And it's up to us to execute and get the revenue up.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian White.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah. Fran\u00e7ois, I'm wondering if you could just get us straight here on what's happening in the cloud. We're talking about a pause. Do you feel like F5 is being marginalized as workloads go to the cloud or do you feel like this is something that you're going to \u2013 their customers are going to come back and they're going to go through refresh and they're going to purchase F5 products? The other thing is, I don't hear this. I don't really hear this pause from other IT vendors. So maybe if you could just explain why this is unique maybe to the ADC market at F5. Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. So, a couple of areas. So, first of all, let me comment on the pause and then I'll come back to your comment on marginalization. No, we are definitely seeing that some deals are getting pushed out as some of our customers think through their architectures. And we have customers across the spectrum, so we have a number of customers who 9 or 12 months ago would have said, hey, we're moving everything to the cloud, and it created a significant pause in the their spend.","And they've now made that decision, they've moved to the cloud and come back and their spend is actually healthier with us than it was prior to them going through the cycle. We have a number of customers and we're seeing more of them that are now going through the cycle and, as a result of that, are pushing decisions because they're revisiting their architecture decisions. In a number of cases, these are not deals that we're losing. We have visibility into these deals, we're not losing them, but they're being pushed out. And that's why we're using this term that we're seeing a pause.","As it relates to marginalization, to your point around do we feel F5 is being marginalized, I don't think so. And I think you have to parse the market a little bit. For the customers that we have typically served and, typically, those customers have large and complex workloads, when they're moving to either private cloud environment or a combination of private cloud and public cloud, we are involved in the conversation, and we feel we have a very strong win rate and we have relevant offerings to support them. So I don't feel that there's any marginalization going on with our existing customer base.","There are, however, a number of applications that are being basically bought in the cloud, but created directly in the cloud that are perhaps typically less complex workloads than we have served. These are, for us, significantly new opportunities, as the world goes more digital, more and more applications. And I would say, yes, in that environment, we are not yet participating to the degree that, eventually, I would like us to participate, but that's essentially an opportunity for us to extend our addressable market that we are going to look at how we can execute against that.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","So is it reasonable to assume since this is a pause that we can see an acceleration in revenue not next quarter but, say, a year out, within a year?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Brian, we're not guiding for next year. But I would say we're pretty confident we will see product revenue growth in 2018.","Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. And just following up on your statement about some product push-outs, Europe has been a challenge and Japan for several quarters now and you've got to think about how long can you keep pushing and pushing and pushing to where you wonder is there something structural or fundamental with the sales process or the product itself.","So it sounds like you believe that people are just pausing. Are you making changes to your go-to-market strategy or it sounds like you said that you expect product growth to continue into next year. How can you be sure, how can you be confident that it's truly not something more structurally in nature?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. So, I think there are two effects in Europe from what we're seeing. One is a bit of the uncertainty that the regulatory environment is creating. There are things like regulation around data protection and all the regulatory, specifically, in the finance vertical, that is causing folks to think about location of data centers, what their hybrid cloud environments are going to look like, et cetera. That's the macro environment and we don't control that or how a real prediction into that other than we know that a lot of this regulation should be settled in the early parts of 2018.","There are also some things that we believe have more to do with the execution of F5, so the more internal. And on those aspects, yes, we are taking actions. We believe that, in some cases, we have probably too many people in some geographies where there's not enough opportunity and not enough people and geographies where we see growth opportunity. So we are realigning our resources against the best geographies and verticals.","I think as I said on the last call, because it's Europe, this typically takes a significant amount of time. It's not \u2013 it doesn't happen overnight. And we're also making sure that we're enabling our teams in Europe, both enabling and training our teams in Europe for the new opportunities that we're seeing around hybrid cloud environments, for an example. So, there are some things we're doing internally that we believe will help and contribute. And then the macro environment, we think, for the next six to nine months, we don't expect a significant improvement in the macro.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then my follow-up question is on your guidance, specifically on sales. Since the results came in even below the low-end of your guidance, have you reassessed the process or reassessed your discounting or how you're rolling up your guidance so we can just kind of see how much credibility there is behind the guidance for the September quarter after the shortfall this quarter which was pretty noticeable?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","We have a pretty strong process that goes bottoms-up against pretty much every geography and vertical, and we continue to be thorough about it. We're being a bit more cautious about EMEA this quarter. We're not expecting, as I said, any improvement in the region, and so we've factored that into our guidance. But the process has been quite thorough as it had been from prior quarters.","The other area that I would flag is in the federal space, there's a bit of timing uncertainty linked to the delay in the budget approval here in the U.S. And we have factored that uncertainty in the federal space as well in our guidance.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much for the details and clarification. That's greatly appreciated.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Silverstein of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Guys, I have just a couple of very quick detailed questions. I'm hoping you'll bear with me. But, first off, Fran\u00e7ois and Andy, I appreciate the questions about U.S. federal, but when I look at the numbers, if I'm looking at the numbers accurately, it looks like your non-U.S. federal is actually down a little over 7% year-over-year and down 11% sequentially.","It's been an area historically that's been a fairly strong, albeit obviously not the largest bucket of revenue. But I'm curious what's going on there, if anything, in terms of secular versus transitory issues. And then specific questions that speaks to forward business. Andy, if you said it, I apologize, but if you didn't can you update us on average deal size, large deal activity?","And if I recall, I don't think it's come up recently. But, historically, you had cited Virtual Edition impact, I think, as being 80% in general on average of the ASP of hardware, obviously, better gross margin in that it would net out as a wash in terms of bottom line or operating profit impact. Can you update us on that and what percent of revenue today is virtual? I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","I'll start on the \u2013 Paul, on your first question. Andy will take the second one. On the non-U.S. federal, I think in the UK, we also saw this quarter some delays. Well, I mentioned the delays in certain deals earlier. In the UK, we had some government deals that were delayed a little bit. Our non-U.S. federal number isn't very large, so there'll be an element of ebbs and flows quarter-on-quarter. But, specifically, this quarter, I think that was a factor.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, Paul. And then on a couple of your other questions; so our average deal size, we actually saw it pull back a little bit. Last quarter, it was around $125,000. And this quarter, it was $115,000. But, really, we didn't see anything in that. We've kind of been in this band for two to three years that would say is in this $110,000 to $125,000 range. So nothing jumped out at us there.","Our large deals \u2013 our largest deals were good in that they were a little bit larger, but there was a pullback on the number of them. If we look above $500,000, we think that we'd like to see more than we had in the quarter, but I wouldn't describe it as a major issue that's been highlighted. We just have been watching that.","And then the software versus hardware trade-off, there's two ways that we look at that. We don't break it out other than talk about software generally. But if we're talking VE versus hardware, the way they're priced, if we look at the different levels of throughput against the different appliances that we think is the trade-off, in gross margin dollars, we think it's pretty much neutral.","We do see \u2013 if you also look at it from the perspective of just when people buy software only versus hardware, does that bring the average deal size down? And in the broader context, usually, we see them buy more iterations of software so it can be net neutral. We have seen though some outlying deals that are just smaller deals of less VEs that has brought it down, but we believe that will lead to more VE deals later. And in fact, as Fran\u00e7ois talked about, if we can leverage those into more licensing type deals, we think we can accelerate that even quicker. So...","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Andy, if I may very quickly because I think this is really important. Speaks to what you guys are talking about. If we look at close rates, to your point that there's been this pause as more and more companies or a meaningful number of companies evaluate public cloud. If we look at your close rates, both measured by number of deals and by the timing \u2013 the timeframe of going from opportunity to close, can you give us any quantification that speaks to these delays?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Just in terms of how long the cycle is?","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, how long the cycle is. And I trust it's probably already quantified, but if I looked at your pipeline, if you said you're making the argument that the deals are still there, but they're just not closing. If we looked at your pipeline, any quantification you'd give us?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, I think I'd approach it more from just a qualitative perspective and talk about visibility, right? And we do believe these deals that we see slip out \u2013 it's hard to say that while we're just seeing a shift from 90 days sales cycle to 150. And so that's how it will work through. I couldn't give you strong metrics like that to rely on.","I just look at it in terms of visibility. And as we meet and talk with our sales teams over specific deals and watch how they're executing, we know that the verbiage around them in a lot of cases revolves around them still assessing how they believe they want to leverage cloud or hybrid and what they're going to do, and it does make it a longer selling cycle with less visibility and when the PO's going to come in the door, and that's this pause that we're talking about.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen & Co. LLC","I appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Thank you.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I've got one question and then I'll have a follow-up too. But I was just looking at Westcon plus Ingram. And the quarter-on-quarter growth there is, if you add the two together, like 12%. Those two were down 3% last quarter.","So it feels like they're kind of bucking the trend. And I wonder is that sort of quantitative evidence of this cloud trend that you're talking about? In other words, that smaller deals are doing fine, but maybe big enterprises that you have more direct relationships are not doing as good or can you just help us understand what's going on with channel versus non-channel growth? And then, like I said, I've got a follow-up to that.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So, the reality is, if we look at our top four distributors, Arrow is also another distributor that rolls in and out of our top 10% distributors. And really, we don't \u2013 we're not seeing any correlation to any broader issues to make there than just other, the ebb and the flow and lumpiness of business quarter in and quarter out with the geographies. If you look at Westcon, which this quarter peaked at 19%, I think, roughly two years ago, there was a quarter where they were at 19% too. And we've seen Ingram strong, so nothing that I would draw from a correlation there.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So you don't see these \u2013 when you add the distributors up, you don't see the same acceleration pattern you see from the stuff you disclosed to us?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","No. No.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for that. That's helpful, Andy. And then the other thing I wanted to ask you is, you \u2013 earlier, I think, in response to Jess' question, you said you're three quarters the way through the product refresh. But then you also made this comment that you guys still have pretty high hopes for the refresh looking forward. Can you juxtapose those two things just kind of clarify what you're seeing there?","It sounds like you're quite a way through the product cycle from your point of view, but then again, you still have a lot to look forward to. So where are we exactly in that cycle from an outsider looking in point of view?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Rod, yeah, just a correction, what I said was that we were three quarters into the cycle not three quarters of the way through. And it's typically eight quarters \u2013 six to eight quarter cycle. So we haven't reached the midpoint of the cycle yet. We've just actually crossed the point where iSeries this quarter represented more than 50% of our appliance sales. In the past, we've typically seen that acceleration when we're closer to the 80% mark of our total appliance sales. So, to be clear, we think it's an eight-quarter cycle and we're about three quarters into it.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And Fran\u00e7ois, just on that, you guys had \u2013 I know you had released these products closer together. Thanks for the clarification, by the way, because I misunderstood what you said. You had released products closer together to kind of compress the cycle, but it sounds like you're thinking that this cycle is kind of more of a normal link at this stage. Has that thinking changed over time or is it, from your point of view, things still more compressed than they would have been maybe the last time you refreshed?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","I think if you look at how this cycle is tracking and we track that fairly closely in terms of what percentage of our total sales are with the new platform. It's tracking very, very closely to what we saw in the prior cycle. So it looks to be taking the same shape. There are some differences in the \u2013 obviously, in the environment.","Last time we did a refresh, ACE replacement actually happened \u2013 the Cisco ACE replacement happened in the similar timeframe and so that gave us an additional boost. That's much less the case here. And also, as we've said before, we're saying that some of the deals getting pushed out as a result of the evaluation of cloud architecture. So, there are some things in the environment that are different to what we had a few years back. But in terms of how the cycle is tracking relative to what we've done in the past is very similar.","Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Troy Jensen of Piper. Your line is now open.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah, thanks for sneaking me in. Quick question for, Andy. Did you say in your prepared remarks that the head count was flat for the quarter?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Quarter-over-quarter, we were essentially flat.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So was your intention coming into the quarter to hire 100-plus?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","No, I think we guided up to 60 and we just would assess it as we went along. As we executed on the quarter kind of two dynamics happened. We had some strategic investments we wanted to make that made us pull back a little bit on the head count. And then, as we were executing through the quarter, we just \u2013 as we were watching what was going on around the world we pulled back and were a little more cautious in managing expenses, and that resulted in people choosing to pull back on head count.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So I apologize if I missed it, but did you say what your intentions are for hiring in the September quarter?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","No, I actually didn't put it out there because it was flat. But like we do every quarter, we're going to watch how we're executing and bring people on board as we can. And I think if you go to the website, you'll see that we're hiring against a healthy pipeline of head count out there, and it will give you an indication of our activity.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. I guess my thought would be that kind of the lack of hiring kind of doesn't really correspond with your thoughts if there is growth in the industry and investing for growth anymore. So, it would just...","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","I actually \u2013 no and I can get \u2013 totally understand, Troy, why you're asking the question. But I would counter that with discussion on the way we've always managed the business and with the focus on profitability as we've executed against revenue. And I think more you're seeing a short-term dynamic here than a long-term belief about this space.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","And the other thing, Troy, is you're looking at an aggregate number. You heard me talk about Europe, and I said we're realigning resources against opportunities. When we talk about the evolution of our offering towards subscription, virtual environment, et cetera, again, that requires some alignment of resources towards these opportunities. So don't mistake the total number in quarter for a lack of activity around hiring folks on what we believe are some very exciting growth opportunities for the company.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Understood. Good luck, gentlemen.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Troy","Operator","Our next question is from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Meta Marshall for James. A couple of questions. Have you during the refresh seen kind of any realignment of customers who might have opted for best last time opting for kind of good or better this time? And second question, just you mentioned that the transition to cloud is kind of an inhibitor right now or just that decision-making process. Are there any partnerships or acquisitions that you guys have looked at to kind of help customers speed that transition or decision process? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Meta. On the first question, yes, actually, we are seeing a higher demand for best bundle than we would have in prior cycles, and that's largely because securities is important and increasingly important.","One of the things that the cloud does is it dissolve the perimeter, and our solutions for security are application centric; they're not perimeter-based solution. And that's actually one of the reasons we're doing well with security and seeing more and more opportunities. So, the best bundle is actually the \u2013 we're seeing higher demand for that, which you can translate into we're seeing a higher security attach rates to our solution, which we actually think is a very good growth driver.","As it relates to partnership and acquisitions, look, our philosophy about this has been and frankly is going to be, we want to have very strong organic plans for addressing the high-growth opportunities in our market, which essentially revolve around the cloud and security. And part of the resource shift that we talk about really relates to how we accelerate our execution organically against these opportunities.","That being said, if we believe there's opportunities to accelerate that inorganically that makes sense for us, whether it's partnership or acquisitions, we will do that. We have a number of partnerships in place already in the ecosystem both with cloud providers and a number of IT \u2013 other IT players that help us, but we won't roll out doing some things in the marketplace if and when we see an opportunity.","Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Yes. Thank you. And perhaps, gentlemen, I might return to the cycle question. Would you mind running through what it is exactly you mean by the iSeries tracking in line with prior cycles because I think it would be easy for us to sit here on this side and say, okay, well, F5 isn't quite delivering on the revenue expectations that you would all like to be delivering on, and so it seems at some level it's a little bit behind. So if you could clarify that a little bit for me that would be wonderful. And as part of that, I'm hoping that you could tell us why the 80% rate is where the inflection has come in prior cycles.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Sure, Jeff.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Does that make sense? Yeah.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. No, it makes sense. I understand the question. Couple of things. So, the reason we're saying it's tracking after prior cycle is really a key metric for iSeries is the adoption of the product in the customer base as in do our customers see good reasons to adopt this new platform and refresh their environment?","And the best way for us to measure that is to look at the percentage of our total appliance sales that come from this new platform. And when you look at that percentage quarter-on-quarter, we're tracking pretty much exactly with prior quarters. Now, to your second question, which was...?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Why 80% is the level we focus on.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Andy. That's largely because, in the past, that has been the point at which customers have made the initial deployments of this new platform, they've done the necessary software upgrades and test and proof-of-concept, they're a bit unfamiliar with the platform and they get into the mode of more repeat purchases and that's where we typically see an acceleration. That's what we have seen in the past and that's why we've looked at that 80% marker as a good indicator of the point in the cycle where we see this.","As I said, again, the environment is different now than it was in the past, but if you look at these metrics we're tracking. The only thing, Jeff, that I would add is, whilst we look at the refresh cycle as a growth opportunity for F5, I think we also want to be clear that that is not solely what we see as the medium to long term growth driver for the company. And I want to be very, very clear with that, that we see the number of applications being deployed in private and public cloud and specifically in virtual ADC market, we see that as a growth market. And a big priority for us is to make our solutions easy to consume, remove any friction there is in consuming our solutions in different environments because we believe that is going to open additional opportunities for us, specifically, in the virtual ADC space. And that I see as a growth driver for the company.","The other important growth driver is application-centric security. It is a bigger issue. We're seeing more and more attach rates to our solutions. We're seeing more security stand-alone opportunities. We have best-in-class web application firewall capabilities. We're seeing strong demand for that. And we think, with the cloud, there's going to be even more of a need for application-centric security. So, beyond the refresh, I see these two as important drivers for the medium to long term for us.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you, gentlemen.","Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc.","Operator, I think we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Henderson of Needham. Your line is now open.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Sneaking in under the wire. So, just to be clear, when you're talking about disruption in Europe relative to data protection, that's not the GDPR initiatives? That's where they put their data centers, correct?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","So GDPR is one of the elements that we've seen as uncertainty \u2013 yes, creating some uncertainty in Europe.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. So, the second question, if I could, the sales force, you're seeing any acceleration in churn in your sales force or other operational staffing levels as a result of the recent choppiness in your performance?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","No. Attrition are in line with historical levels. In fact, attrition is much better than it was even a couple of years ago. So, no, we're not seeing that.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Then one on the technical side. So, micro segmentation, containerization, is that causing any change in the way people are thinking about how to deploy your products, particularly as they try to look to single binary code architectures? And does that impact your business on that \u2013 as that transition happens to more of a DevOp delivered orientation?","And then, second off \u2013 hanging off of that on the security front, almost every security company is talking about the importance of platform and, on the other side of the coin, talking about the importance of large data sets in order to do advanced analytics, can you talk about your positioning on those two subjects, please?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yes. So, I'll take the security question and Ryan Kearny will talk about what we're doing about containers. So, yeah, the position that we have that's actually quite unique in the security space is, as I said, number one, that we \u2013 unlike a number of other players, we're not a perimeter security company. We're more of an application security player.","And one of the benefits that that gives us is we have the ability to see data in the line of the application of between the user and the application. And because of the capabilities in BIG-IP in terms of scale and throughput, we also have an ability to analyze the in-line data in real-time. So that gives us the opportunity to do some interesting things with the data, which we think is important and probably will play into our future. Ryan, on the containers?","Ryan Kearny - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Yeah, Alex, good question. Container \u2013 containerization in micro-service environments have definitely been a hot topic and have shifted many customers' future architectures of their applications into these environments for some of the obvious benefits.","One of the things Fran\u00e7ois mentioned in kind of the opening comments is two major releases, two major technologies we released actually this quarter to actually address container and micro-service environments. One of them was the application services proxy, which sits inside micro-service environments to link those micro-services together, and then also, the container connector, which sits inside those environments, which is able to orchestrate effectively F5 technology, BIG-IPs in the north-south footprint, right?","So, this quarter, we made some pretty major technology releases to address these environments that we've seen customer demand over the last \u2013 definitely over the last year for. I will mention one thing though about at least the micro-service environment. There's a lot of the \u2013 a lot of our customers are in architecture stage or development stages, and we've not seen production, we've not seen significant production environments in micro-service environments, but I do see that is coming. It's definitely coming and there's a major interest in it from our customers and is a major focus of our product development, technologies and road map.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Given we got only a couple of minutes left and you said you were going do this last question, maybe I'll stick one in if I can on a really much broader subject. So, this company slowed down to a snail's pace, it's in the middle of the major product cycle and it's barely growing what it declined in the year ago. Get it that you want to say that there's accelerated growth. But you've always focused on being 100% oriented to being a pure ADC play in this one area.","When companies slow down, sometimes you need to change your strategy. If you were to look at your second strength, which is your ability to deliver a great brand name and super distribution reach, why not become a little mini Cisco in the application layer, which is where Cisco would like to be and start to be \u2013 use your acquisition and your cash position to acquire companies that would then be able to leverage through your sales force to reinvigorate your growth rate?","That's something that obviously happened at Ciena.

Listen, one of the \u2013 I think where you are correct is, one of the key, I'd say, intangible assets of F5 is our understanding of applications and the concentration of application networking talent that exists at F5 is \u2013 I think is unparalleled in the industry. And you've heard me say before that I believe we have an opportunity to expand the breadth of application services that we offer. And security is actually one of these domains.","Our philosophy around this is that we have to have strong organic plans to do that and there's a number of things we're doing organically that we've started executing on that we'll be able to discuss at a later stage, not today. But we're doing a number of things organically to expand our addressable market beyond perhaps the traditional solutions that we offer today.","If and when we see some good opportunities to extend that inorganically, as I said, we will not rule that out. But it's got to start with some organic execution. And we have a priority, as I said, to grow the top line. We said that's our number one priority. We do see product revenue growth next year and we've got a number of exciting organic propositions that we're executing on that we believe will contribute to that.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co.

We hope you can join us there.","Now I'll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. We are very pleased with the momentum we saw in our business across the back half of fiscal year 2013. Q4 was a solid finish to the year, with very strong customer reception to our new platforms, record competitive win rates and increasing traction from expanding market opportunities. Entering fiscal year 2014 with the most innovative set of products and solutions to date, we feel better than ever about our strategic position in the market and the opportunities ahead. Following my discussion of results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2013, I will provide guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year.","Now our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Revenue of $395.3 million was above our guided range of $378 million to $388 million, up 7% from the prior quarter and 9% from the fourth quarter a year ago. GAAP EPS was $0.97 per share, above our guidance of $0.93 to $0.96 per share. These GAAP EPS results include a $0.04 per share impact from a higher-than-anticipated GAAP effective tax rate due to a onetime adjustment of deferred tax assets related to Acopia. Our non-GAAP EPS was $1.26 per share, above guidance of $1.17 to $1.20 per share.","Q4 product revenue of $212.3 million, up 8% from Q3 and 1% from the fourth quarter of last year, represented 54% of revenue. Service revenue of $183 million increased 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year and accounted for 46% of revenue. Book-to-bill for the quarter was greater than 1.","Q4 revenue from our Application Delivery Services business was $391.9 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $3.4 million.","On a regional basis, the Americas grew 15% year-over-year and represented 59% of revenue. EMEA accounted for 22% of overall revenue, growing 7% year-over-year. APAC, representing 13% of revenue, decreased 1% year-over-year. And Japan, at 5% of revenue, was down 11% from a year ago.","By vertical, finance represented 22% of sales during the quarter; telco, 18%; and technology, 15%. Total government was 14% of sales, including 7% from U.S. federal.","During Q4, we had 3 greater than 10% distributors, Ingram Micro, which accounted for 16.3% of total revenue; Avnet, which represented 15.8%; and Westcon at 11.6% of revenue.","Continuing down the income statement. GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses of $203.2 million were within our $199 million to $206 million guided range and included a onetime $2.4 million charge related to the consolidation of certain subleases at our corporate headquarters. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $181 million.","Driven by strong Q4 revenue, GAAP operating margin was 31.7% and non-GAAP operating margin was 38.1%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter, impacted by the onetime adjustment related to deferred tax assets previously discussed, was 39.5%, above our forecast of 37%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.5%, in line with our forecast.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $148 million cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.27 billion at year end. For all of fiscal 2013, cash flow from operations totaled $500 million.","DSO was 46 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $19 million. Deferred revenue increased 19% year-over-year to $531.4 million.","In Q4, we repurchased approximately 569,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $87.79 per share for a total of $50 million. Approximately 181 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.","During the quarter, we added 170 employees, ending the year with approximately 3,355 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 325 employees, an increase of 11%.","For the full year, revenue for all of fiscal 2013 was $1.48 billion, up 8% from fiscal 2012. Product revenue of $798.9 million was down 2% from the prior year and accounted for 54% of total revenue. Service revenue of $682.5 million grew 22% during the year and represented 46% of the total.","GAAP net income for fiscal 2013 was $277.3 million or $3.50 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $362.9 million or $4.59 per share.","Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '14 outlook. As discussed during our third quarter call, we expect to see normal seasonality as we enter a new fiscal year, characteristic of most of our peers in the tech industry. We also anticipate a more significant pullback in sales from U.S. federal government, following the disruption from the October government shutdown. At the same time, we are encouraged by the recent momentum in our business and the continued ramp in sales of our new platforms, and we plan to continue investing in the business to leverage current and emerging opportunities and drive top line growth.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we are targeting revenue in a range of $390 million to $400 million. We expect GAAP gross margins in the 82% to 83% range, including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $219 million to $226 million, including approximately $32 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.4 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","As discussed on our call -- our Q3 call, we decided to move our annual date for issuing RSUs to employees from August 1 to November 1 to better align these awards with our fiscal year end and annual reviews. And we expected stock-based compensation expense to drop in Q4 and to be higher in Q1. As such, stock comp expense in Q4 decreased to $22 million from $28 million in Q3. Our Q1 '14 guidance of $36 million in total stock-based compensation reflects the upcoming annual RSU grant in November and general growth of the employee base.","We anticipate an effective tax rate of 38% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35%. These estimates do not assume an extension of the federal R&D tax credit beyond 2013.","Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $0.81 to $0.84 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.17 to $1.20 per share. We expect DSO in the 50-day range. We anticipate inventories in the range of $19 million to $21 million. We believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of $155 million, and we plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 to 150 employees during the quarter.","Looking out to the year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year are as follows: We believe the company-specific drivers, new products and expanding market opportunities that propelled our growth in the second half of fiscal 2013 position us to achieve year-over-year product revenue growth throughout fiscal 2014. We anticipate overall gross margins may decline 50 to 100 basis points over the course of the year, driven by increased investment in our consulting services, which carry lower margins. It is our view that in addition to increasing services revenue, these investments drive future product growth, deal sizes, customer penetration and overall customer satisfaction.","In line with our revenue expectations and as a result of our commitment to continue investing in our business to drive top line growth, we expect non-GAAP operating margins to be in the mid-30s range for the first half of the year and to strengthen to the upper 30s range in the second half. Capital expenditures are expected to be $6 million to $12 million per quarter. We expect Q2 stock compensation to be consistent with Q1 and to decrease in Q3 and Q4. Total stock compensation expense for fiscal 2014 is anticipated in the range of $130 million to $135 million.","And finally, assuming the R&D tax credit is not extended during fiscal 2014, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 38% on a GAAP basis and 35% on a non-GAAP basis throughout the year.","I'd now like to note a couple of changes in information we will be providing with our reported results beginning in Q1. We believe that the level of granularity we provide on sales by vertical segment often results in a distorted perspective on the overall trends in our business. In most cases, quarterly strength or weakness in any one vertical is more of a result of volatility rather than a significant upward or downward trend and often engenders more confusion than insight into our business momentum. As such, we have made a decision to reduce the number of vertical segments we break out.","Beginning in Q1, we will no longer provide separate data for the finance and technology verticals. Instead, we will combine these with more than half a dozen other verticals, currently grouped together as other, into a single segment called Enterprise. Along with the percentage of Enterprise sales bookings during the quarter, we will continue to provide separate percentages for telco and government, including a breakout for U.S. federal.","Also, beginning in Q1, we will no longer report book-to-bill on a quarterly basis. We believe the value of this metric has become very limited and will be less meaningful as we expand into new pricing and licensing models, such as our subscription-based model from our recent Versafe acquisition. We also believe inconsistencies in reporting this metric across the industry creates confusion. As such, discussion of backlog and book-to-bill could be misleading in any given quarter, both in terms of providing insight into our reported results and as a predictor of future performance.","As John mentioned, we will be holding our Analyst Investor Meeting at the New York Sofitel on November 14. We look forward to seeing you there. With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2013, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2014.","Fiscal 2013 was really a tale of 2 halves. We experienced continued decline in year-over-year growth in Q1, and particularly in Q2, the quarter ending in March. In the second half of the year, we experienced strong sequential growth and improving year-over-year growth with strong sales momentum in Q4.","During fiscal 2013, we continued to invest in additional headcount during the year, increasing our total net headcount by 325 employees, ending the year with a total of 3,355 employees. We exited fiscal 2013 with a stellar balance sheet with almost $1.3 billion in cash and investments and no debt, having purchased 200 million of our common stock during the year.","Fiscal 2013 was very productive from a product development perspective. We completed our largest appliance product refresh ever, and we developed a host of new software solutions, which have significantly expanded our addressable market. We believe these new platforms and software solutions will drive market share gains in our key markets.","New platforms delivered in the year include a high-end VIPRION 8-slot chassis and a new range of appliances, the BIG-IP 2000, 4000, 5000, 7000 and 10000 Series.","We also introduced the largest portfolio of software virtualization products supporting the top 5 hypervisor platforms, VMware, Microsoft, Xen, KVM and Amazon Web Services, with the best performance in the industry. This array of new physical and virtual products enhance even further when integrated in F5's innovative ScaleN multi-tenant and clustering architecture, allowing our customers to seamlessly scale operations to realize the full value of virtualization, cloud computing and on-demand IT.","Perhaps the most strategic platform which we introduced in fiscal 2013 was our new centralized management platform, BIG-IQ. Our strategy is to have BIG-IQ provide centralized management orchestration and automation for all BIG-IP modules, either standalone software solutions and\/or integrated solutions. BIG-IQ is designed to provide our customers with maximum flexibility in how they deploy and manage the entire suite of F5 solutions globally, either on premise or in the cloud.","We also increased our security solution portfolio during the year with the addition of the Advanced Firewall Manager, AFM. And we also added significant enhancements to our application firewall and access solutions, ASM and APM. I was extremely pleased with our execution across our security business in fiscal 2013. Approximately 30% of our total product sales last year included one or more of our key security products, ASM, APM and AFM, as part of the overall customer solution. It is clear that the architecture of our ADC platform with our TMOS full-proxy functionality provides the unique characteristics and performance needed to protect applications and individual users from complex and sophisticated attacks. There's a growing awareness of our security solutions in the marketplace, and we expect our strong sales momentum in this market to continue in fiscal 2014.","We have seen growth in security sales across all our major verticals, both in the enterprise and in the service provider markets. In particular, we see a large opportunity in the service provider market with our Gi firewall solution. Our Gi firewall is situated on the perimeter between our service provider's mobile network and the Internet, and is ideal for protecting subscribers and network from complex attacks such as large DDoS threats.","We are starting to see wins in the service provider market with our new policy enforcement and carrier-grade network address translation modules, and we have also made tremendous progress with our Traffix Diameter solutions for LTE rollouts. Our competitive win rate for Diameter opportunities has strengthened throughout the year, and we believe we have a real technology advantage with our Diameter solution portfolio. We are involved in some large-scale implementations with Tier 1 service provider LTE rollouts and the pipeline of future business continues to grow.","Our Services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2013 and continued to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor, while maintaining customer satisfaction at world-class levels. The attach rate of service-to-product sales continues to improve, and we once again experienced excellent renewal rates. We also continued to grow our consulting business, which increases customer satisfaction and drives additional product revenues.","We completed 2 acquisitions during fiscal 2013. In February, we acquired LineRate Systems. Their patented technology enables web application developers to integrate programmable network services directly into applications. The LineRate technology broadens our application-focused ADC solutions and advances our overall ADC technology leadership.","In September, we acquired Versafe, an existing F5 technology partner. Versafe provides state-of-the-art technology for Internet, anti-fraud, anti-phishing and anti-malware solutions. Versafe's advanced real-time web and mobile protection solutions, combined with a security operation center, will provide greater breadth to F5's existing security solutions. I believe that both of these acquisitions will prove to be strategic assets in fiscal 2014 and beyond.","As far as Q4 is concerned, I am very pleased with our results. We delivered 9% year-over-year growth in spite of a cautious spending environment. More importantly, we delivered both sequential and year-over-year product revenue growth.","From a geographic perspective, the Americas region was once again our best performing region, with both strong sequential and year-over-year product sales growth. Sales in EMEA were also up both year-over-year and sequentially, but sales in our Asia-Pacific, Japan region were down as we experienced a tough business environment in China.","We posted another record quarter in security sales with continued momentum in AFM, APM and ASM sales. As I mentioned earlier, our Traffix Diameter LTE sales win rate continues to increase, and we delivered a record number of sales wins in Q4, with Cisco ACE replacement projects. We have now recorded over 900 ACE replacement project wins in fiscal 2013, and we continue to see the pattern where we replace ACE products with F5 platforms, offering customers additional functionality, including security, access control and application acceleration.","As we begin the new fiscal year, it is appropriate to remain cautious given the well-publicized uncertain macroeconomic environment. Having said that, we believe we have a number of reasons to be confident as we move into fiscal 2014. We enter the year with a number of tangible business drivers, including the product refresh opportunity, continued security sales growth, new opportunities in the service provider market with our consolidation strategy and our Traffix LTE Diameter solutions and continued momentum with ACE replacements.","More importantly, I believe F5 is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the fast-moving technology and business trends, including the growth of private and public clouds, 4G, wireless rollouts, complex global security threats, network function virtualization and software defined everything.","I look forward to reviewing our strategy and future plans in some detail at our Analyst Investor Day on November 14.","As far as the Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy provided our projected revenue range, as well as some of our high-level expectations for 2014. As I mentioned last quarter and several times over the last few years, we expect to see some seasonality in our business during Q1. This first quarter seasonality, which is normal in the technology market and in line with our peers, is reflected in our guidance.","Acceleration of product revenue growth continues to be the major financial goal for fiscal 2014. I believe the growth drivers are in place to achieve this goal, and I remain very optimistic about the future of F5 as we enter fiscal 2014. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and their partners for their tremendous efforts last year, and I look forward to continued support in fiscal 2014.","I'll now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a question or 2 on the guidance, if I could. It sounds like a little bit of a period of investment here, so we're going to see operating margins probably for the next few quarters a little lower than they've been. Could you just talk about how long-term you think that would be? Is there a change in kind of the investment required? And related to that, similarly, on the gross margin, is this a sign that maybe the market is getting a little bit more competitive and these industry-leading gross margins maybe have to continue to fall a little bit?","Andy Reinland","Yes, so this is Andy. Taking the second question first on the gross margin. We haven't really seen the competitive landscape change that much. Really, for us, we see next year product margin being as strong as it's been. My comments were about wanting to invest in consulting, that it's just a lower margin business but is becoming a higher priority for us as we see the impact of getting consultants into these large customers, providing value, being a constant F5 presence and pushing our messaging and looking for new opportunities. So that will pull the margin down, but we think that will more than pay for itself. Related to the op margin, so we see it as kind of a first half, second half, right. In the first half, we want to continue investing in the business through the year. Just looking at our guidance for Q1 and the first half, we think we'll see that operating margin in the mid-30s for the first half. Second half, we should see it improve up to the upper 30s.","Timothy Long - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. That upper 30s is probably more indicative of your long-term goals though?","Andy Reinland","I think it's a reality with what we think is going to happen in terms of revenue growth through the year. But as we've always done, we'll watch the business and manage accordingly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes of Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two things if I can on what you just said to Tim's question with regard to revenue growth throughout the year. I was wondering if you could be a little more -- give us a little more on that with regard to how revenue progresses throughout the year? When do you get the yield on that consulting investments that you're doing? And then you said competition hasn't changed, but Citrix just confirmed some weakness in NetScaler and obviously, they had some bigger numbers in other quarters, and it does appear that something might have changed with regard to them. And I was wondering if you could clarify your statement that nothing has changed. It seems like you guys, obviously, have rebounded. So if you could comment on the revenue trajectory throughout 2014, when you get the yield on consulting and then what you're thinking there in a little more detail, and then the competition question.","John McAdam","Yes, this is John McAdam. I'll answer the second question regarding the competition. I mean, nothing's changed in terms of the competitors that we're up against. But if you look at what's changed from our perspective is that we're -- obviously, we've completed the product refresh and we believe that the product refresh that we've done makes us more competitive. Also, we've added a lot of functionality to our software portfolio that I talked about. And if you look at CR security products, we think we've got best-of-breed throughout the main solution portfolio, so we're in really good position. Also, our competitive win rates. I think Andy actually mentioned this, our competitive win rates were at record levels last quarter. So we've talked about it being in the high 80s and the 90s. They actually hit record levels, which would imply that we're in a good position from a competitive perspective.","Andy Reinland","And to the other elements of your question. The revenue uptick, I'm not going to get any more definitive than the comments made in my script that we think we are very well-positioned going into the year. We do anticipate Q1 seasonality and our guidance, I think, reflects that. But we do believe we're positioned to achieve year-over-year product revenue growth throughout the year. And I'm going to leave my comments at that. Also, on consulting, we actually think the uptick on revenue there is close to immediate. I mean, the real issue is getting them in, getting them trained, but we believe the demand is there for more consulting services and we're going to hire to meet that demand.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Sue of RBC Capital Markets.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm trying to reconcile the weak first half that we saw versus the strong second half. And I'm trying to see if the second half, was that, in the cadence of it was really deferred projects that got recognized in the second half, was it just a slower ramp of the new products that we're now seeing at the moment. And just to give us some color, if we look at the annual numbers, were up 9%. We're seeing a decline there. Any thoughts of the maturation of the ADC market, John, your thoughts there? And then Andy, just a split between the higher expense, sales and marketing and R&D?","John McAdam","Okay. Just on the first part, yes, as I said, it really was a tale of 2 halves in fiscal 2013. If you look at the first half, we really -- we were in the -- not even in the middle of the product refresh. We'd started it at the beginning of the year, and we started bringing in some products. It was pretty well-known that we were doing the product refresh. It's hard to actually judge what the Osborne effect was in that with customers delaying. But there's definitely was some of it. So I think that was an area. The other thing that we talked about is the $1 million transactions in the first half, indicating a pretty tough spending environment from our perspective. We saw improvement in that in Q4, so I think we've seen across the enterprise, in particular, definitely an uptick in spending in Q4. And then of course, we didn't have -- we don't have that Osborne effect affecting us at all. The other thing -- so that's that. Then the other thing I think has definitely helped us in the second half is adding more software functionality, more solutions and expanding the market. The best example of that is the advanced firewall manager that we actually started, I think shipping that towards the end of February. But it really started to take off in the second half and that's also been a good driver. So there's been some fairly significant changes between those 2 halves, and I think that's the biggest difference.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. John, any thoughts that market just maturing, the base ADC market. Because I know you're doing well in security but just the bread-and-butter ADC market.","John McAdam","I think to answer that question, you really need to sort of understand our strategy in that market. Our strategy in the ADC market, and it's been that since we come out with TMOS years ago, but the strategy is basically to make sure that our solution, the ADC, application delivery controller, is really a base platform that can be built on with extra solutions. And as you build those extra solutions, you are increasing your market. So we have constantly, over the years, increased the ADC market. Is load balancing a mature market? Absolutely. Is it significant to our strategy? Not that much. I mean we've got the best load balancer, but the key for us is our security solution, our service provider solutions, the expansion areas in the market. And from that, I would say it's the opposite. I'd say it was the ADC market, we are constantly making it an ever-increasing and newer type market.","Andy Reinland","And then, Mark, you were asking about the breakdown of sales and R&D as a percent of revenue. So non-GAAP sales was 28%. R&D was 12%.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Going into the first half, that's kind of the mix that we should expect?","Andy Reinland","We don't comment on that going forward. I think you're going to see us focus on investing from a headcount perspective pretty much as we have historically in the 30% service, 30% Dev and the rest in sales.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Pacific Crest.","Brent A. Bracelin - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","One clarification and one question. The clarification was on margins. You mentioned 50 to 100 basis point decline in margins, but most of that's going to be in the service side. So just clarifying, are you indicating that product gross margin would remain at the 85% level that it's been at the last 2 years?","Andy Reinland","Yes, I think that's basically what we're laying out there. And obviously, we have some elements of our business on the software side that could drive that, but we're not planning on that improvement as we model out the year.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, helpful. And then my question really ties to the product increase sequentially arose, what, 8% sequentially. That's the highest we've seen in about 2 years. If I back out the telco government business, the new general enterprise category was up 10%, strong as well. So I guess my question would be, how would you characterize what drove that increase? Was it specifically tied to the 2 new appliances, the 5000 and 7000 that shipped in the quarter where there was some pent-up demand? Was it broader-based? Any additional color you could provide relative to kind of the pipeline of opportunities and kind of what drove the momentum in the quarter would be helpful.","John McAdam","Yes. I mean, it was pretty broad based. I mean, if you look at some of the drivers we talk about, clearly, I mentioned the ACE replacements that we did during the year, that has obviously been a good opportunity for us, and that is very, very broad based. Security has been awesome, so security has continued. But in terms of the overall data center spending, especially in the enterprise, that was pretty wide and we saw bigger deals coming in as well. We didn't -- it wasn't linked to 2 or 3 really big opportunities. It was more broad based, but we did see an uptick on the higher end, million-dollar-plus orders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","First off, I think at your last Analyst Day, you had given us a sense for the contribution from security. Can you give us any color on kind of the size or the growth that you've seen in security during fiscal '13? And then secondly, what was the contribution from new customers versus existing customers in the quarter? And have you seen any change in terms of Cisco's reception to working with you versus the partnership with Citrix?","John McAdam","Yes. On the first part, I mentioned in my introduction that approximately 30% of the sales we made in fiscal 2013 had one or more of the security modules involved in the sale. So clearly, that's a pretty -- and that's up pretty significantly from the previous year, I mentioned this a couple of times, security has been a strong driver. The issue we have, and we really don't have any solution to this, is that the reason we wanted it the way we have is that our customers do more than just security with our products. That's the whole point of the ADC strategy. I mean, you could -- if you made a very strong -- if you're very biased towards security, you could say most of that business was driven that way, but that's not quite the case, its driven by a range of our portfolio of solutions, but up significantly from the previous year and linked into 30%, approximately 30% of the overall sales bookings that we're making.","Andy Reinland","And then Erik, for your question on new versus existing. So in this quarter, as we look it new business was about 47% and existing business was 53%. You compare that to a year ago where new business was about 40% versus 60%. So we are definitely seeing a trend to new business, which we think is those ACE opportunities.","John McAdam","Yes, and just on that you mentioned about partnering with Cisco, we -- if you look globally, there has been the odd situation where that happened. But frankly, it's been tactical and where sales teams may want to work together. The interesting thing is, we certainly don't compete with them much. There's not much competitive overlap at all. But from an ACE perspective, we feel pretty comfortable about our value proposition, partnering or not.","Operator","The next question comes from Troy Jensen of Piper Jaffray.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Andy, did you say service provider vertical is 18% of sales?","Andy Reinland","Yes, 18.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Can you guys just touch on that. If you look at year-to-date, a year ago, it looks like you did -- I excuse me, I guess I was looking at the only 3 months or 9-months over 9-months. But just in general, can you talk about the service provider verticals, seems like it's down from last year, the pipeline there, deal pushouts, anything you can say in the telco business?","John McAdam","Yes, and you're right. I mean, obviously, we had a pretty tough one in March, where it was 17 and 18% is definitely in the -- we've typically been doing, as you point out, Troy, between 20% and 25%, sometimes a little bit more than that. We talked about this a lot. It's very project-related, the telco business, and it tends to be lumpy. So I think you're going to see movements like that happening. Having said that, and I'm going to ask Manny to comment as well, Manny runs the service provider and the security business, but he can comment in a second. But there's bright spots. I mean, we've started to see some policy enforcement wins. We had Carrier-Grade NAT wins, these in effectively new modules, that was last quarter. I mentioned about Traffix, the revenue in Traffix is still relatively light, but the project wins are increasing rapidly. So we expect, as we start to see rollouts and milestones being met, a link to revenue, you'll start to see some benefit there. And then the big opportunity, I think, I mentioned this, is security. We're actually doing, we think we got a big opportunity with the Gi firewall, and with the firewall solutions in general. Because of the performance, because of the complexity of what we can handle. And in fact, we're actually working and looking at some trials right now with some of the large service providers where that is actually affecting our roadmap, because that's what we want to do. We want to make sure that we've got -- we customize it to their needs. So we feel, going forward, we have a real opportunity with security in particular. Manny?","Manuel F. Rivelo","I'll just comment, Troy, a couple of thoughts. I think John captured it very well. What we're seeing in the service provider arena is we're seeing service providers needing to do a couple of things. One is reduce their total cost of ownership of their networks and really address the economics out of the equation. So we're working with service providers on how we take our agency platform, really the combination of services, and deploy those services in their infrastructure, either physical implementation and\/or software implementation for their NFV deployments that are out there. And really, that's about service consolidation, moving from this concept of device sprawl to eloquently managing their services. In that arena, they're also looking -- moving very aggressively in addressing the monetization side of the house. And to do that, they're becoming much more application-centric in guaranteeing quality of service, if you will, or experience to the applications. Well, what becomes really interesting is then that they need to start addressing a lot of the ADC characteristics around accelerating applications, making them available, but also the security concerns of those applications. So we think we're pretty well aligned, but as John pointed out, they take a while because they are big deals. They tend to move a little slower because of the implementations. But we feel confident with our security solutions. We feel very confident with our application and Traffix steering solutions, and really confident also with our Diameter stock to take advantage of the 4G movement that's out there.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And if I could follow up on that, Manny, you guys talk a lot about large-scale traffic wins, could you frame up what large scale is? I mean, these multi-million dollar deals initially with a lot of repeat business to follow?","John McAdam","These are the deals that can often be more than million dollars plus and also they can be Tier 1 providers.","Manuel F. Rivelo","All right. So we are seeing those deal across the globe in every single theater and they start out relatively small, but they're all maturing to very significant opportunities for us right now. And as you know, the 4G movement is really still in its infancy in the sense that only 1\/3 of the global operators in the world have moved to Diameter. But the movement over the next couple of years is to 100%. So we expect that these 400 or so mobile operators out there that are going to be implementing Diameter solutions and only growing, over that window of time, their needs.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjiv Wadhwani of Stifel.","Sanjiv R. Wadhwani - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","John, a question on ACE. You gave a metric, you've done 900 replacements. Can you talk about 2014, do you still see significant opportunities and growth in that segment of the market? And then briefly if you could touch on Japan, it sort of been down year-over-year for about a year now. So can you just talk about what's going on there?","John McAdam","Okay. Yes. On ACE, absolutely. I mean, we reckon the installed base is probably $1 billion plus. But the key thing we keep hammering on, because it's very real, we've got great experience of this now, is that when we do an ACE replacement it's typically a new project and certainly -- or a new account for us and it means we can sell more of our solution portfolio. Security is the best example, but not the only example. So as we've seen this pattern, so we think it's the actual market opportunity is much bigger than $1 billion. So it's probably at least a 2- to 3-year market we will be talking about. But remember, once we get into accounts like these accounts, we sell much more so it's effectively an everlasting opportunity for us. And what was the -- oh, Japan was the other question. Yes, you're right. I mean, we -- what we're seeing in Japan is we definitely saw a big jump in business after the tsunami, and I think there was clearly a lot of data center builds happened. And last year, in particular, 2013, was a pretty tough comparison every single quarter, with those data center build-outs. So we would expect to see year-over-year growth now in most, if not all quarters. We'll see, we'll take this a step at a time, growth in Japan. So not too worried about it. I do think 2014 is going to look better from a comparison's perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein of Cowen and Company.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions, guys. First off, Andy, I trust it goes without saying in terms of your product gross margin commentary that pricing has not become a more meaningful issue?","Andy Reinland","Yes. We have not seen a change in the competitive environment other than our comments on increasing win rates. So yes, pricing has not changed.","John McAdam","I mean, the question has been asked 2 or 3 times. Just to be really clear on this, the gross margin that we're talking about is about consulting resources and professional services. To push projects faster, get product revenue faster and increase customer satisfaction, and we're seeing a real demand for it from the customer base, so it's not something we can ignore.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Understood. Secondly, I heard your comments about the number of million-dollar deals having picked up, versus they've been lackluster for several quarters they've picked up this quarter, I heard that. But can you comment on average deal size? Can you give us a number, either or some rough quantification versus the preceding quarter?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So it's actually been fairly constant over the last 2 quarters, right at 100,000. And interestingly enough, if you go back to Q4 a year ago, it was right at 100,000. So we've seen it be pretty consistent at that level.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Was there a dip? Refresh my memory, was there a dip in the intervening couple of quarters? When you say a year ago, was that 100 and the last 2 quarters, it was at 100?","Andy Reinland","No, it's actually been fairly consistent through the year.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","One more if I may, if you already answered this, my apologies. But when you look at the government vertical, everyone's obviously talking about government concerns, goes without saying. What are you guys seeing?","John McAdam","Yes, it's John here. I mean, basically, first of all, main thing is that we've got great pipeline there. We had a pretty good Q4. We feel really good about our team. But I think you'd be crazy right now to make any future type statements on a federal government, in particular, I'm talking about. So we'll just see how things roll out. But I think in terms of what we do across the government, the fact that it's very Internet-based, the fact that their consolidating data centers, I think is going to remain a good vertical for us. But we're certainly not going to talk forward-looking, especially in the short-term over the next 6 months. We'll see -- we're clearly taking a conservative view when we come up with guidance.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","John, Can I squeeze one more in. With respect to the December guidance, are you all expecting product revenue to -- can you give us some sense for what your expectation is? It just turned positive for the first time in a while, I mean, year-over-year perspective, should we expect...","John McAdam","Andy stated in his introduction, I think he actually repeated in the question that we would expect to see product revenue growth year-over-year each quarter next year.","Paul Silverstein - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","But can you give us some quantification from [indiscernible]","John McAdam","That's all we're giving you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of things. Just a quick clarification, on the fiscal year commentary, you talked about gross margin declining 50 to 100 basis points through the year and you've also talked about the services pushed towards lower margin consulting. So I just wanted to see what's your thinking in terms of your product gross margin through the year, essentially is the 50 to 100 all because of services? Or is there some element of gross margin decline in your products?","John McAdam","Okay. I don't like to be aggressive here but, clearly, we've made this point a couple of times. So I'll make it again and please don't ask anybody else on the call. The consultancy is why the gross margin -- we're going to see some small decline there. It's not in product. We feel really strong about our product competitiveness. We've added more software modules, so there's always a chance that we actually can improve that. And we're not being pushed in services down to the lower-type end [ph]. We're actually, it's incremental. Our core Services business remains great with high renewal rates, high attach rates, all that good stuff. But as we get more and more complex environments, whether it's large rollouts or whatever, customers would like more and more consultancy from us and we're addressing that customer needs.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I also want to see if you could touch on China. You talked about that being weak in the quarter. Other tech companies have talked about China issues. If you could help us understand, first of all, what your exposure is to China and what your thoughts are in terms of what caused the issues?","John McAdam","Yes. It's definitely been a tough environment. I know -- probably like you have been listening to other vendors as well. I mean, we're just seeing a tough spending environment that basically the number of government-sponsored projects seems to be reduced. I don't know how long it's going to last. Our exposure isn't massive. I mean, we've got good operation in China, a number of offices there. But it's a smaller percentage of our business. I don't think it's a massive exposure. And frankly, moving forward, I don't think it's a big exposure at all because we probably have a low baseline there, but we did think we should call it out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Modoff of Deutsche Bank.","Brian T. Modoff - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I won't ask a question with a negative connotation. A couple of things. Can you talk a little bit about the telco side? You were saying that you're starting to see bigger opportunities there. Do you expect as a percent of revenue through the year, do you expect that to grow larger? And then, how's management viewing your NexGen network firewall opportunity, TAM point of view, looking mainly at kind of $2 billion ingress market or are you looking at the full $7 billion security TAM?","John McAdam","All right. They're both in Manny's field. I'll mention -- He can mention the security, I'll just talk again about telco. It's hard to predict in terms of if you took the whole year where we think it will be percentage-wise. I think you're going to see a similar trend of what we've seen. So some good quarters as projects rollout, and then maybe some not too good ones as we've seen some project delays. But we really do see some strong opportunities in telco. We think we've got great a strategy with the consolidation strategy that fits exactly where they want to go in terms of reducing the number of boxes, having them in one consolidated solution, whether it's Policy Management, Traffix D, security. Security and sales, we think could definitely be extremely good for us, especially if we execute on these trials and bring the functionality that we're working on feverishly. We think that could be a very big opportunity for us. And then as we've mentioned a couple of times, we feel our Traffix win rate is definitely improving, and improved dramatically over the last fiscal year. So we've got some real good tangible drivers there. So Manny can talk about security and obviously, comment on telco as well.","Manuel F. Rivelo","Brian, let me give you some more background on security area. So if we feel look at security, it's a little broader than that, just the NexGen firewall. And we'll break this out for you in 2 weeks or in New York at the Analyst Day. But some of the markets that we're after are the firewall market, and that is not the NexGen traditional firewall market, think about that more as the -- or the NexGen new market, think about it more as the traditional firewall market, which is a $2 billion market. But above and beyond that market, we're in a security market segment around web application firewall. We are in the market around web access management. We're in the market around remote access, DDoS protection, mobile security management and web anti-fraud. So the market is significantly larger and has a very large CAGR that's actually going to exceed that $7 billion. So we'll share that information with you, but it's much more than just firewall, it's a whole solution set, both for the user, for the network and for the applications.","John Eldridge","Okay. Thanks a lot for joining us, and we hope many of you will be able to attend our Analyst Meeting in New York on November 14. And for those of you who can't, we look forward to talking with you next quarter.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Before I start my prepared remarks, I\u2019d just ask you to be a little patient if pause I have been battling with cough so with that we\u2019ll get underway. Sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 reflected the seasonality we normally see at the beginning of our fiscal year. And in general we saw fewer large deals this quarter compared to previous quarters. As a result revenue of $462.8 million was in the lower half of our guided range of $460 million to $470 million reflecting 14% year-over-year growth and down slightly from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.","GAAP EPS was $1.21 per share, above our guidance of $1.10 to $1.13 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.55 per share also exceeded our guidance of $1.46 to $1.49 per share. Both GAAP and non-GAAP results include a one-time benefit related to the retroactive reinstatement of the R&D tax credit for 2014 resulting in a benefit to EPS of approximately $0.08 per share on a GAAP basis and $0.07 per share on a non-GAAP basis.","Product revenue of $240.9 million in the first quarter was up 10% year-over-year, down 6% sequentially and accounted for 52% of total revenue. Service revenue of $221.9 million grew 18% year-over-year, 6% sequentially and represented 48% of total revenue. Accounting for 56% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 14% from the first quarter of fiscal 2014. EMEA which represented 25% of revenue grew 20% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 14% of revenue and grew 9% year-over-year and Japan revenue representing 5% of total, grew 3% from a year ago.","Sales to enterprise customers represented 63% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23% and government sales were 13%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. Federal. In Q1 we have four greater than 10% distributors Westcon, which represented 17.5% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 16.7%; Avnet at 13.9% and Aero which accounted for 11.4%.","Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.9%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.1%. GAAP operating expenses of $251.1 million were within our target range $245 million to $253 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $222.9 million. GAAP operating margin was 28.6% our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.9%. Reflecting the onetime benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal R&D tax credit for 2014 are GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 34% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32.3%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $186.4 million. In Q1 we repurchased just under 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average of $128.70 for a total of $150 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.17 billion in cash and investments. With the addition of $750 million authorized by the board for stock buyback at our most recent board meeting approximately $931 million remains authorized into the share repurchase program. DSO at the end of Q1 was 50 days. Inventories were $27.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 20% year-over-year to $680.3 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 3,945 employees an increase of 110 from the prior quarter. ","Moving on to Q2 outlook, based on the strength of our current pipeline including the return in the number of large deal opportunities and continued momentum from our key drivers. We anticipate sequential and year-over-year growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2015. Our revenue target for the quarter is $465 million to $475 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 82% to 82.5% range including approximately $3.5 million of stock based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be in the 83.5% to 84% range. As outlined in during our Q1 earnings call we anticipate an increase in stock compensation in Q2 related to the timing of our employee grand. As such for Q2 we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $255 million to $264 million including approximately $34 million of stock based compensation expense, and $0.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. ","For Q2, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 38.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5%. These rates assume no reinstatement of the Federal R&D tax credit for 2015. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.07 to $1.10 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.48 to $1.51 per share. We plan to increase our headcount in excess of 100 employees in the current quarter and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $110 million reflecting the impact of two federal tax payments that we normally incurred during our fiscal second quarter. With that I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam ","Thanks Andy and good afternoon everyone. ALOHA Red new came in at the lower end of our guidance and I\u2019ll comments on that in a moment. I was pleased with the significant progress we made in all our major initiatives. For example we have some very strategic sales wins in the service provide market. We had a very successful launch of Silverline our key components of our hybrid applications services strategy. We added significant functionality to our orchestration and management product BIG-IQ. Which was key to winning the strategic security wins and is also another component other hybrid applications services strategy. We also continue to make great progress with our SDN partnerships both in technology and in go to market initiative. From a sales perspective the majority of the shortfall are come from the Americas region where we experienced larger than expected drop in million dollar plus deals in both large enterprise and U.S Federal opportunities. We believe this was a seasonality issue due to a very large number of large wins closing during a fiscal year and Q4 drive. On a positive note the pipeline creation rate in Q1 was very strong -- I am sorry -- and was very strong and the time line for the quarter was very good. So I misquote a sentence here from the original. Japan business was also very -- was also below internal forecast but this was not a major factor overall. Both APAC and EMEA delivered year-over-year sales growth. The EMEA region was a star of the quarter and once again delivered an excellent performance with solid year-over-year growth. Our services business continue to deliver solid results and excellent profitability along with the healthy increase in deferred revenue which is now approximately $`680 million and should board well for future business. ","We continue to experience strong momentum with our Good, Better, Best sales motion in Q1 with customer adoption continuing to be very strong in the Best category highlighting the success we are achieving with our security solutions. I was also encouraged by the continuing strong growth of our software revenue which increased 44% year-over-year. The fastest growing area in our software business is our core virtualization ADC. Our software growth is being driven by the increasing customer demand for hybrid solutions that allow greater flexibility in the deployment of application services within and across datacenters and into the cloud.","Our ability to provide our solutions as special software only offerings across all the major high providers combined with our unique orchestration functionality in BIG-IQ is enabling customers to move to software-defined data centers and NFV architectures. We are also seeing growth across the entire portfolio of our software module offerings driven by the rapidly increasing reorganization and ADC is ideal platform to ensure application security. Our security business continues to be a largest growth driver with strong sales across the security solutions portfolio including ASM, APM and AFM. I already made reference to strategic security sales wins in the service provider market. We won\u2019t allow to AFM Gi firewall sales to Tier 1 service provider which resulted in two transactions in Q1 being over $1 million each in value. ","I have mentioned several times last year that our BIG-IQ security management and orchestration product roadmap was being influenced by our Tier 1 service provider North America. This initiative has proved to be very successful and we are now starting to see some real momentum globally with our Gi firewall solutions and we believe it can be a strong growth driver in fiscal 2015 and beyond. ","Overall we had a solid quarter in the service provider market in Q1. We had several very strategic wins over and above the Gi firewall deals. For example we when allows 2 million plus software only NFC application with another Tier 1 service provider in North America. Our consolidation strategy and focus on security NFC, Gi 1 services and LTE applications is resonating well with the service provider. As we offer them the opportunity to reduce OPEC while monetizing that added value services with our unique application and subscriber awareness. We continue to see strong sales of Cisco ACE replacements last quarter. As we have seen in previous quarters customers continue to take the opportunity to add additional functionality. For example, our AFM and our AFM security module when the implementing new F5 solutions. We have created a sales service web portal for ACE Migration which complements a significant experience and consulting expertise and increases our competitive advantage. Also we intend to step up our market initiatives on the ACE opportunities starting this quarter to take advantage of our current momentum and experience in transitioning ACE customers to F5 ADC solutions. ","We have experienced a very positive reaction to the launch of our Silverline hybrid application services strategy from our sales force, partners and customers. The initial launch included our subscription based DDoS service and our anti-malware and fishing protection service. These cloud-based offerings delivered flexible best-in-class services and offer a hybrid model complementing F5 on premise products and solutions. We have already seen some excellent orders for both our subscription based DDoS service and anti-malware solutions. We are planning to increase the portfolio of cloud-based subscription services starting with the vast AFM solution in the new few months. ","From a product perspective, we have a host of new functionality and new products on our control map. We have recently released a new high-end 2U platform the BIG-IP 12000. This platform extends performance of a content those in platform by 25% increases SSL performance by 600% and more than doubles the number of high performance vCMP instances The SSL performance is really important given the SSL effort we are trying to foresee. In the near future, we will be enhancing on management and orchestration capabilities with BIG-IQ release 4.5. This release will include significant enhancements to our datacenter security product, AFM, and ASM as well as comprehensive support for our SDN ecosystem to revise application monitoring capabilities with an SDN enabled network. The BIG-IQ cloud module now supports SDN controller integration with Cisco APIC, VMware, NSX, Alcatel Nuage, Microsoft SCVMM and OpenStack. We will also be adding a new module BIG-IQ ADC. BIG-IQ ADC provides centralized fine-grained application management across cloud-based SDN and traditional network infrastructure. ","The drivers of our business remain robust and I expect momentum to build in this coming quarter and continue into the second half of the year. Our hybrid application services based on our Synthesis architecture and Silverline Cloud Services is resonating really well with our customers and pop-ups. This strategy combined with the strength of our partner ecosystems in areas like SDN provide F5 with the opportunity to play a very strategic role as customers continue to strive the competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. ","Also our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively which in term significantly expands an addressable market and increases the type of revenues streams available to our sales force and partner channel. As far as the outlook is concerned and the indications that we expect both sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. As I mentioned earlier our business pipeline create rate was very strong in Q1 up significantly over the previous year and the pipeline of business this quarter looks very strong. In particular, we have seen a large increase in the number of large deals in the pipeline. We continue to plan for growth in the business by investing in headcount and infrastructure moving forward while delivering world class operating margins. ","I continue to feel very positive about future business prospects for F5. I believe that their existing product portfolio of hybrid application services strategy and our product roadmap are not only in line with the customer and market trends but are also key to enabling these trends. ","In conclusion I would like to thank the entire F5 team of partners and customers for the support last quarter and with that I will hand the call over for Q&A. ","Question-And-Answer Session ","Operator","Okay. [Operator Instructions]. The first questions comes from Jayson Noland, Robert Baird. Your line is open. ","Jayson Noland","John, any additional color on the large deals -- I know you said fast but is there a certain vertical you could call out and with complexity part of it just a confusion around architectural change or?","John McAdam","No, we obviously checked in a big way and really and this is sounding weird but really there was nothing complex that we could see. We just saw -- the more we looked at the pipeline going through the quarter you could see that the forecast deals weren't moving along as fast as they should -- that was -- this was only in the Americas by the way and the enterprise and then in Federal as well some. No vertical that stood out just generally across the board. And then we were not talking about a significant number of million dollar deals but they obviously make a difference. ","Jayson Noland","And those didn't become smaller deals, they should got pushed out in to Q2. ","John McAdam","Absolutely. Yes. ","Operator","Next question from Ehud Gelblum from Citigroup. Your line is open. ","Ehud Gelblum","Just one view clarify couple of things, John you talked about software 44% growth that was you were talking about virtual edition software as opposed to software?","John McAdam","So 44% was the total software and within that -- and that includes virtualization and that includes modules and areas like vCMP within the ADC solution. And the other thing I said was that the fastest growing was the virtualization ADC. However, the security module software is a pretty significant part of that growth as well. ","Ehud Gelblum","Can you give us a sense as to of that how large is the security module part of that? ","John McAdam","We don't give out that specific -- why -- because I don't have them to hand anyway but we typically don't give that out. But security you are going to hear me talking again a few times in the call and that still remains our biggest driver and I think that's going to be the case for a while. ","Ehud Gelblum","Okay interesting I did want to drill down. ","John McAdam","Because if you take the Gi firewall for example. You see that these were pretty significant deals and of course the security module ASM associate with it and that's pretty expensive. ","Ehud Gelblum","I was trying to drill down little bit on some of the Gi firewall wins. You talked about wins in Tier 1 service provider for that. Can you give us a sense as to who you beat out I can guess I mean is this beating of Juniper, SRX or who you are beating out. And was this new opportunity that you brought in for or was this existing opportunity where you replace someone and the sale was if so was up for functionality features, can you give us a sense as to what that opportunity looks like?","John McAdam","Yes. So typically and the one that I was talking specifically on this call and we have seen Gi firewall deals over that one wave, the one I was referring to for U.S Tier 1 providers and nobody mentioned customer names of course. The $2 million plus Gi firewall deals was directly related to frankly I think it's about two years we've been working with this particular service provider on the orchestration road map so that\u2019s easy, the initial orders and that opportunity that can be big obviously is only when we execute properly.","Ehud Gelblum ","Can you be specific who you\u2019d be down on that or it was an incumbent there?","John McAdam","I mean incumbent typically in the areas in the U.S. as Europe. It\u2019s not always been that, some of the replacements that\u2019s typically incumbent.","Ehud Gelblum","Okay. One last thing I want to ask services obviously were very, very strong, there is obviously a renewal period happens but between differ revenue and large company services is there any global connect we can get a sense on as to what meet the jumps that strong in services.","John McAdam ","On the revenue side the jump was we\u2019ve seen for a number of years clients go for terminus contracts 1st of January and the 1st of July. This quarter obviously ended with the 1st of January we had a very strong push and we\u2019re able to recognize more revenue within the quarter and as far that push we build out the deferred revenue. ","Ehud Gelblum","So January 1, haven\u2019t you recognized it again in December quarter?","John McAdam ","Because contracts end for January, when you\u2019re trying get them renewal before that date and because the terminus some of the units have not been on support for two, three or four months so we get some back dated revenue there at the same time.","Operator","Okay. Next question comes from Kent Schofield with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Kent Schofield","On the million dollar deal idea can you talk a little bit about it\u2019s just seems like you\u2019ve been talking a little bit more about large deals, is this a function of some of the new products, some of the bundling, is this just something that we should think about more going forward in terms of having these larger deals in the mix?","John McAdam ","No, we don\u2019t think so, I mean if you look at last fiscal year 2014 we saw a pretty significant rebound in the large million dollar plus deal every single quarter and obviously we saw a bit Q1 ending in December, and having said that we expect to see that rebound given what we\u2019re looking at A, in terms of some of some of that slipped and B, the creation rate that we\u2019ve done over in Q1 which was pretty solid. So we expect the million dollar numbers that strong again in the current quarter.","Kent Schofield","Okay. And if some of that closing the deals from the December quarter -- ","John McAdam ","Exactly, some of that and some its new deals with -- I mentioned the pretty strong rate.","Operator","Okay. Next question Brian White, Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.","Brian White ","John, I\u2019m wondering when did the pipeline start to shrink for the quarter? When do you start to see the weakening? Analyst day was obviously pretty upbeat so was this kind of late December phenomenon?","Unidentified Company Representative ","The pipeline is self-shrink -- when you start to see deals sweep you actually see the pipeline create, what we saw was the pipelines that we were expecting to close not quite coming in and then slipping at into the next quarter.","And that tends to happen towards the end.","Brian White ","And could this simply be the phenomenon we\u2019re following up fiscal year ends, we\u2019ve seen this before fiscal year end you overshoot a little bit in the fourth quarter and then it takes away for the next quarter.","John McAdam ","And that\u2019s exactly when I said my script is we believe what happened.","Operator","Next question Michael Genovese, MKM Partners. Your line is open. ","Michael Genovese","Great, thanks very much. John in the past, in some of the quarters when the million dollar deals have gone down you\u2019ve talked about that being indictor of macro, but this time you\u2019re really saying it\u2019s seasonality so if you can talk about that why you\u2019re convinced there? And then secondly, is there an element of meeting a little bit of recent year coming a little bit lower, is there any element here of this transition to kind of an on demand software in virtual model, does that play any part in the miss from the quarter?","John McAdam ","So, by there were only guidance in the quarter remember and I know that\u2019s not good because we tend to just to be clear. On the first part you\u2019re absolutely right, if you go back 2013 when we saw a fairly precipitous drop in $1 million deal we did talk about macro, more than once in that case and that because when we look at that the forward-looking pipeline wasn\u2019t anything as strong as it is looking today. So we\u2019re seeing here this is a definite scenario in our opinion but we really believe this was more seasonality link than anything. And a piece of fed as well with us clearly some lack of transparency in fed and will know that budget and there was were the two things that we see. But as we look forward we see a stronger pipeline with the higher percentage of factoring in their pipeline, hence was repairing from actual. Second question was?","Yes, translation from the software. No, we don\u2019t see that in fact interesting enough these software deals that we see from the virtualization perspective or from an NFD perspective these are big I mean these are actually pretty big deals as customers are feeling a closer application and buying a lot of instances of the virtualization. So maybe overtime we\u2019ll see that but I don\u2019t believe that was indicator this quarter.","Michael Genovese ","We just have one follow-up with these large virtualization deals though, is there any change in the competitive landscape, any new competitors that you don\u2019t traditionally see competing for the deals?","Manuel Rivelo","Michael, this is Manny. No, absolutely not, I mean what we\u2019re seeing as we're basically seeing the need depending on being the enterprise or service provider. Of course customers who want to go software are only architectures. In general, there are some newer competitors sometimes in the market but it tends to be the same classic competitors who I have offered a hardware version and the software version.","John McAdam ","And remember with these virtualization deals, we have the same concept Good, Better, Best we have modules we have all the competitive functionality we have we have in this software side as well.","Operator","Next question Bill Choi with Janney. Your line is open.","Bill Choi","So on the larger deals again I guess, I am curious because there are so many things happening between hardware moving to also support virtual editions, timed with SDN, your product becoming more softer, again how much of this might be more products specific, the deal getting more complex. It does seem like the lot of new technology to think about and Cisco did have some weakness in its billings for the October quarter guys like VMware also had some choppy bookings, so I am curious as you look the complexity of products can you really attribute any of that to the complexity?","John McAdam ","Really I don\u2019t think we can and I just don\u2019t think we can. It\u2019s based what the deals that they have we understand them. They\u2019re very similar because what we have in Q4 or we had a massive crucial with large deals, and we don\u2019t see any changes in that landscape whatsoever.","Bill Choi","And one of the factors that impacts growth rate was -- you\u2019ve refreshed all of your product line little over a year ago so last year we enjoyed quite a bit of acceleration in growth rate with coming off of tough comp, are you seeing any impact from just the pent up demand maybe that was created from the product cycle and to things slowing down after people went ahead and did the refreshes, any thoughts on that as a driver?","John McAdam","You know, we thought but and if you look at the drivers and it's look through them again just to summarize but obviously product refresh we talked about there. It was a low hanging fruit at the beginning, it\u2019s not quite yet at the moment probably, do we still have a very large installed base of products that we can refresh absolutely. So I think that area obviously 1200 with SSL capability I think is clearly at one point a product but it sells its capability that\u2019s a pretty good opportunity to refresh as well. But the big drivers of security was a firewall that we talk about at ASM with I think the wise solution and DDoS on premise and off premise. And then the service provider we feel very good with the drivers there from an NFD from a security perspective TCP optimization. We still feel good about ACE I mentioned of what we\u2019re going to do there. And the FDN partnerships and in general the cloud movement I think is a growth possibility for us. So product refresh probably to some degree but we still think has a big opportunity there.","Bill Choi","Okay last question given the growth in pipeline partly the new creation as well as deals slipping, with your guidance that product growth rate is continue to decelerate to somewhere near high-single digits when you look at your guidance, how do you get this back up and what isn\u2019t the guidance for the March quarter better just given the buildup of the million dollar plus project? Thank you.","John McAdam ","Historically last quarter you need to be careful with that because it\u2019s always beginning of the financial year for our companies, and we\u2019re assuming, I hope relatively conservative growth rates in the pipeline and we\u2019ll see what takes us.","Operator","Okay next question Subu Subrahmanyan, The Juda Group. Your line is open.","Subu Subrahmanyan","Two questions first on the service provider side, if you could talk about given the CapEx backdrop you certainly have some wins and share gain opportunities so how do you think about the service providers vertical for this year as you expected to grow us a percentage of revenues in fiscal \u201914? And then in the virtualization side, I certainly here you John that the deals are large but if you do a comparison with the architectural changes, if you had sold all hardware and senses as you might have few years ago versus a mix of hardware and software, what that is doing to the overall dollar value of the deals and also the profitability of the deal that would be helpful?","Manuel Rivelo","Subrahmanyan, this is Manny. I am going to answer the service provider. On the service provider there are four major drivers that I think we talked more about them definitely in John\u2019s prepared comments, which is consolidation across the Board from a service provider point of view and that consolidation of services predominately traffic-steering services, care-giving that services and some of other services in there that were consolidating type of environment, that reduces CapEx really for many of the operators throughout there because they\u2019re going from multivendor to single vendor. Second major driver we have a security which is also something we can overlay on that same footprint again through a consolidation point of view, but we call it out as a separate driver because of just the impact from the side associated with that, but there is NFV and the NFV footprint that we\u2019re seeing out there which are still early proof of concepts to some degree and we are in various proofs of concepts across the world. Was trying to see some of those pan outs and that\u2019s what happened in this past quarter and why we got a big bump, also on our software sales. And the last is the LTE of the mobility movement going to 4G networks which we\u2019ve been feeding in the customer environment for the last two years. And was trying to see there also from a driver perspective is that these networks get deployed, get expected usage volume goes up new devices are being enabled meaning additional mobile handset. But also new devices from the perspective of the internet of things that we\u2019re going to see additional software license there. So those are predominately the four major drivers and those are usually either tackling the CapEx line from a consolidation point of view, or the monetization line from something along the perspective of LTE and being able to bring on new services to the market.","John McAdam ","And on eventualization say the things which I think the space in [indiscernible] that I get to answer again to a similar question which was basically first of all these are still number. I mean this is still a relatively small market versus overall ADC market. But the deals that we\u2019re seeing are pretty large in nature and we need to market exactly to see the demonstrates of is all hardware waste is but I am not sure we see much difference quite frankly. So I don\u2019t think that\u2019s - if you\u2019re looking for exact platform we\u2019re half in terms of gain to lower end we don\u2019t think so.","Manuel Rivelo","And just to add one more comment any get on the software side that we see is we see an expansion of the application needs in the market segment. But I mean by that is historically a handful of applications in the typical enterprise and service provider got the ADC services because there was harder deploy much more complex. As we move toward a much more software based architecture when you see is a broader set of applications getting these services got things to do apply to those services in the environment. So it\u2019s actually to a large degree and expansion in the market.","Operator","Next question from Brent Bracelin, Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Brent Bracelin","Thanks two quick follow up if I could. On the million dollar deals if you look across the broader enterprise we\u2019ve actually seen a trend toward and you did as well up and saw this quarter, an increasing number of larger deals that closed. Do you think what you saw on December was company specific or do you think there were other factors here at play?","John McAdam ","That\u2019s a really hard one we don\u2019t know the answer to that right. We just don\u2019t do the answer I think as more company announced that there may be some more news here. I certainly wouldn\u2019t call that\u2019s why we\u2019re not calling as my crew either quite frankly. The other side of the coin is that create rate that we had is probably the biggest create rate we see is not the biggest and certainly one of the biggest. I am talking about large deals, so table tell and tell us whether it\u2019s a bigger issue or not.","Brent Bracelin","Then the follow up question is back to software and as we kind of compare contrast the software growth rate versus your reported product growth rate it was 44% software growth rate this quarter versus 10% product growth. If I look at your Analyst Day you\u2019re talking about I think 41% security software growth rate versus 17% product growth rate. So there is a widening gap their between some of the growth in software versus product to appliance overall. Why shouldn\u2019t we expect slightly more tempered growth going forward with the mix shift to software given the trends over the last couple quarters? And frankly now given some announcements around new products where you\u2019re going to be pricing those products on a subscription basis.","John McAdam ","I think if you take a medium to long term due that\u2019s correct, that is absolutely correct you\u2019re going to see is selling more and more software we\u2019ve done that now and we push the salesforce to do that, that\u2019s is a competitive edged is obviously very, very possible. We think when migrate in terms of BIG-IQ orchestration for managing software across close and close across data center et cetera. So you will see that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a complete revolutionary process I think it\u2019s going to be evolutionary. If you look at the -- it\u2019s interesting if you look at GI firewall opportunities the software content in that quarter is very significant. But still is a obviously the hardware content because it need to call this significant amount of traffic either on the detail side of things or just in pure mobile traffic firewall protection. So I think the trends is going to be there but to pick one quarter from Q4 to Q1 and say that's a trend would be very dangerous. We don't believe that.","Operator","Next question James Faucette Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. Most of my questions have been answered so I want to dig a little bit just around more of the edges if you will. First wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you think what\u2019s happening in Japan and APAC, you called out that Japan was a little bit below your forecast. And then conversely what you think was going right and EMEA in particular with weakness of the Euro seems like that could have been subject to a little more weakness than what you saw in I guess there is a follow up to that is there going to be a point at which you feel like to have to reprise products for that market. And how should we take that into account? ","John McAdam ","Let me start with EMEA because that\u2019s an easier one. EMEA in my opinion is tremendous execution and we have great management their they\u2019ve been covering their territory really well, selling big deals, selling a software capabilities, internally always had a very strong leaning towards security and very [indiscernible]. So I think we are talking execution. I think in Japan it is different, Japan still tend to go for a smaller type products, where quite competitive there and spending a lot time trying to get direct business app, direct touch I should say still with part of the direct touch. We made some progress but it\u2019s pretty slow and general economy is quite slow. Then APAC we have been doing some changes, some management changes. We actually feel good about the trajectory APAC is on. ","James Faucette ","So, back to your looking forward is, you feel like you are going to I know for a lot of other vendors they had to or they asked their retailers and buyers to absorb some of the impact of the depreciating euro. But wondering if you feel like you are going to have to change pricing into that market and how take that into account or are you going to be alloy basically effectively price increases to those customers?","John McAdam ","Historically when we\u2019ve seen fluctuations in currency because we U.S. dollars principally in EMEA and we have been able to navigate that working with the partners and the resellers conversely they benefit at times when it\u2019s gone the other way. So I am not sure we would have to fairly do a change in price strategy from that, but we will as we execute to the quarters take that into consideration as we look at deals and work with the partners and resellers to close business. ","John Eldridge","Excuse for interrupting this is John Eldridge we are going to take two more questions and then wrap it up. ","Operator","Catharine Trebnick, Dougherty & Company. Your line is open. ","Catharine Trebnick ","Can we go back to the service provider for a minute. And any of the NFC, are you see it just to get more color around this. You said proof of concept have you deployed? Has there been any deployment with NFC et cetera. And then the follow on question has to do with the enterprise spending. So first if we get out some color on NFC with carriers. ","Andy Reinland","So yes on the NFC side we have close to 2000 proof of concepts throughout the world just to give you a size of the magnitude of the transactions and those across all of the theaters. The wins that we recently seen which varied across two of the theaters are predominantly security related wins where we are taking our security products from a software perspective and introducing inside that environment. Obviously they expand beyond security, they also are traffic steering type of deployments, but they are going into the concept of beginning to consolidate services on a virtual EPC, and lot of the providers are moving in that direction fairly quickly. So we are doing well in the environment. We are integrating our stock with lots of different SPN providers in the market segment and that gives us a lot of flexibility to work with those operators. ","So its early days but we are seeing a lot of good momentum a lot of good traction and proof of concepts are going favorable. ","Operator","Last question then from Tim Long, BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. ","Tim Long","I will try to sneak two in here if I could. First on the Good, Better, Best, I just have an update there you talked a little bit in the past we know the Best option is doing well. Could you talk little bit about the metrics there, how broadly is it through the sales force now is it fully everywhere? How many deals is it influencing? Are we still seeing growth from that or we starting to reach a more full penetration? And then the second one John I think you mentioned something about factoring the largest deals little bit more into next quarter, I guess part of that is conservatism. But I am just curious if given the uncertain macro are you also as a team factoring in the rest of the business, the sub $100 million deals more than normal as well in the guidance?","John McAdam ","So on the Good, Better, Best. The metrics are very similar. I mentioned still gravitating greatly towards Best. In fact I think this quarter even higher in terms of a percentage towards Best. And if you look at where we are in the process, North America of the Houston, and they have been pretty aggressive in selling that, we started in a couple of quarters later when the quarters one to two quarters later seeing EMEA starting but if more room to do the job. And then APAC and Japan and particular so tend to lag a little bit with making changes like that. So we expect that to start to rave up in the future as well. ","In terms of the factoring, actually when we do our factoring we do intend to just factor by size of deal. We look at the overall factor, we look at the fact of timeline and we look at close expectation. So that tends us to runway across the low deals up to the high deals as well. ","John McAdam ","Okay, thank you very much for turning in. And we look forward to talking with you again next quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude the call for today.

F5\u2019s fiscal second quarter marked a return to product revenue acceleration as strong Telco sales and continued momentum in software and security drove revenue ahead of our guidance.","Revenue of $339.6 million, which exceeded the high-end of our $332 million to $337 million guided range, grew 5.3% from the prior quarter and 22.4% year-over-year. In line with our expectations Q2 revenue from Traffix Systems was not material to results.","GAAP EPS of $0.86 per diluted share was at the high-end of our guided range of $0.84 to $0.86.

We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 125 employees in the current quarter. We estimate our DSO will be in the upper 40 day range. We expect inventory levels within a range of 17 million to 19 million and we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $110 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our Q2 results. We delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 22% and 18% year-over-year product revenue growth. I was also pleased with the performance of all our major sales regions. Each region produced solid year-over-year sales bookings growth.","The Asia-Pacific, Japan region had a very strong quarter, especially in Japan and China. North America had another well-executed quarter, driven by very strong service provider sales and an improvement in our U.S. Federal business. EMEA had an excellent quarter with solid year-over-year and sequential sales growth. Our services business had another stellar quarter exceeding both revenue and profit goals, as well as posting a very significant increase in deferred revenue of approximately $33 million.","Continuing the momentum from Q1, sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were very strong with sales bookings of VIPRION up over 200% from last year. We also continued to experience strong sequential and year-over-year growth and sales from our software-only virtual editions solutions.","With standalone virtual editions of our entire suite of software modules, we now have the most comprehensive portfolio of software-only ADCs in the market. Attach rates for all our software modules also showed strong growth, especially those that are part of our integrated security offering.","All of our security products continued to gain momentum in Q2. In addition to strong sales of ASM, APM, EDGE Gateway and DNS Security modules, we saw a growing demand for our TMOS-based data center firewall solution, which has obtained ICSA Certification.","During the quarter, we enjoyed a large number of significant wins protecting large web-based application environments for traditional firewalls like the functionality and scalability needed to deal with these new advanced persistent threats on large customer facing applications.","With TMOS v11 running on our high-end systems like VIPRION 4400, we can deliver more than eight times the throughput of our competitors firewall solutions at a significantly lower price, while still providing the industry best layer 3 to layer 7 security and application functionality.","In late February, we augmented our expanding array of Telco-related capabilities with the acquisition of Traffix Systems, the leading provider of Diameter signaling product for service providers. The Diameter protocol has gained industry-wide acceptance by the 3GPP and GSMA as the standard for the network signaling in all 4G\/LTE networks.","Diameter plays a vital role in the management of 4G\/LTE and IMS networks including billing and policy deployments, enabling service providers to monetize the networks by providing a menu of subscription-based services.","The Traffix team\u2019s deep understanding of the needs of service providers and the scale and developing technology to manage, scale, secure, integrate and apply Diameter services within legacy and next-generation networks is a uniquely valuable asset. No other company in the industry has as wide and rich functionality to simplify and enable the next-generation Diameter signaling infrastructure.","It\u2019s recently introduced Signaling Delivery Controller, SDC, provides a strategic point of control in the service providers networks, acting as an intelligent tier in those networks enabling interoperability, security, scale and flexibility in managing and optimizing signaling traffic.","That should sound familiar to anyone who follows F5. Our vision has been to create a converged carrier architecture that unifies IP services end-to-end across the application, data and control plan. Diameter is a foundational piece of that puzzle and we are delighted to have the Traffix team join the F5 family.","As Andy mentioned, while we do not expect to see any material revenue contribution from the Traffix Diameter products in Q3, we are very pleased with the progress we have made and the growing number of proof-of-concept we\u2019re engaged in around the world as service providers accelerate the launch of 4G or LTE networks.","Early indications from these POCs are quite positive and we believe validate the unique value proposition. The combination of F5 and Traffix offer to service providers in this rapidly expanding market.","With respect to our core ADC business, we continued to extend our technology leadership last quarter with the introduction of the VIPRION 4480. Our newest chassis-based product is specifically designed to enable service providers and enterprises to address rapidly increasing traffic levels and the growing demand for enhanced services.","With the industry-leading capabilities of the VIPRION 4480 and other -- our other high-end platforms, organizations can more efficiently scale their infrastructures and seamlessly integrate security, including data center firewall and access solutions without sacrificing performance or ease of management.","VIPRION 4480 extends our performance leadership in all key metrics, including SSL, layer 4 and layer 7 that includes the market\u2019s first 40-gigabit per second Ethernet support for an applications and services platform.","By leveraging F5\u2019s hardware and virtual platforms, and our peripheral clustered multiprocessing technologies, organizations can remain more flexible as they build out dynamic infrastructures, including cloud and virtualization technologies to support business initiatives and ever growing user requirements.","Unlike other vendor products which can be difficult and costly to upgrade, our VIPRION solutions automatically cool resources as new blades are added enabling organizations to implement a true \u2018scale on demand\u2019 strategy.","The new blades and the four-blade VIPRION 4480 chassis effectively doubled the performance of the VIPRION 4400 and an eight-blade version is planned for later this year. We are also making good progress and our plan to refresh the current one-year and two-year appliances this year, leveraging technology that was developed for the VIPRION 2400, including next generation CPUs, FPGAs and other components.","In addition, we have another major release of TMOS plan for later in the year, which will include DPI functionality, a host of new security features and major enhancements for private and public cloud environment.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see solid sequential growth this quarter. I feel very confident about the future prospects for F5. Our technology leadership is as strong as it has ever been. Our competitive win rates in the field remain at world class levels and our pipeline of future sales opportunity is extremely robust as we enter the second half of fiscal 2012.","We are really well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our core ADC markets as well as exploiting new expanding marketing -- market opportunities in cloud based architectures, the security market and the service provider market.","I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and our partners and look forward to the continued support throughout the year. And with that, I will now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instruction) Our first question today is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks and congrats guys on a good quarter. Maybe just a couple of questions, first of all, Andy, on your comments on Traffix impact on the P&L, can you tell me what non-material means? What is the dollar level you feel is immaterial because my contacts would tell me Traffix is doing $3 million to $4 million a quarter and if we account for that, I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to view your June quarter guide?","And John, can you talk about -- it looks like a lot of things, kind of, went well in the quarter. Can you talk about what sort of things that didn\u2019t go well from your standpoint in the quarter and what is it that you\u2019re focusing on from an execution standpoint near-term?","Andy Reinland","So Ittai, it\u2019s Andy. On Traffix, when I say non-material, I mean, on the revenue side, I\u2019m talking pretty small amounts. Primarily, service-driven revenue at this point, we\u2019re looking at the revenue recognition. And when I talk about next quarter, in our guidance, we\u2019re not assuming revenue from Traffix. So that\u2019s what I had assumed.","Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay. Very good.","John McAdam","And then the question to me regarding what went -- what didn\u2019t go so well. First of all, I mean, let me reiterate, I was very happy with the fact that all the regions had good robust performances and I talked about that. Andy gave some specific detail on it. So, I was really happy with that.","If you look at the verticals, clearly, financial vertical was doing some work from its normal value. We don\u2019t think there is anything systematic there at all. In fact, we expect it to be up in this current quarter. Telco was very high and that we expect that to be down somewhat in the coming quarter, which I guess balances that. And really, when we look at the pipeline, that\u2019s the way we manage the business\u2019 overall pipeline and I mentioned it was really good.","So, I was pretty pleased. I was obviously very pleased with security and what we were doing there right across the board. The data center firewall solutions are coming on very strongly. The part of an overall solution but security in terms of being part of the features of our overall solution has been excellent. The software module attach has been -- was really good as well, so, generally, pretty happy.","Ittai Kidron \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay. Very good. Good luck guys.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from George Notter, Jefferies. Your line is open.","George Notter \u2013 Jefferies","Hi. Thanks very much. I just wanted to ask about the public sector piece of your business. We get the sense from the IBM call last night that public sector was softer for them certainly. I mean, can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing there, what the outlook is going forward? Thanks.","John McAdam","","I mean, first of all, the issue with today\u2019s public sector is that a lot of companies define it definitely. We tend to talk about core government business, both globally and then, of course, U.S. Federal. The U.S. Federal did show improvement in this quarter.","I mean, we\u2019re still -- I still think you have to be very weary given the especially [we are running] in terms of budgets and the government and the voting year this year. So, we are being, I think reasonably conservative about it. And then if you look one of the way, there wasn\u2019t much change for us. So, really no -- slight improvement in Federal and not much change elsewhere. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Erik Suppiger, JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP Securities","So just quickly on the data center firewall, when do you think that that will be a meaningful revenue contributor or are you at production level at this point, where you\u2019re seeing it deployed in a production environment?","John McAdam","Yeah. It\u2019s very much a meaningful revenue contributor right now. I mean, we have won pretty significant deals and by significant -- greater than $1 million in some cases. As I mentioned but, sometimes we have the scenarios where the customers not only using as a data center firewall, but maybe doing some optimization as well and that\u2019s why we\u2019re -- in terms of producing actual numbers, it would be too subjective to do that, but it\u2019s extremely material.","As is the ASM application has security module and we just finished our quarterly business reviews again with North America and the field is really high on our Access Policy Manager as well, the access module. So the security has been actually material for us, but it\u2019s definitely something we think is going to be an expanding opportunity.","Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP Securities","And who are you competing with in some of those seven-figure deals?","John McAdam","Very often with Juniper, with Cisco as well. We\u2019ve probably seen some checkpoint. I\u2019m not sure, but Juniper is probably the main area.","Manny Rivelo","Yeah. This is Manny Rivelo. We\u2019ve seen all three of those players. Those are the predominant firewall players that have been in the market for a long time and what we are seeing is, because the new threat vectors that are out there to protect these web applications, customers are looking at layer 3 to layer 7 integrated functionality at very, very high connection counts and throughput. And with the TMOS-based data center firewall provides and has always provided, is the capability of scaling at a very, very high level, specifically around applications.","So it\u2019s been a logical marriage, because in quite a few of those environments, they\u2019ve already been using the F5 technology and the result of that now consuming security services on top of the traditional services that they\u2019ve used.","Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP Securities","And you saw some good growth sequentially with regards to those large data center firewall deals in the March quarter?","John McAdam","We saw good growth sequentially with ASM, APM, Edge Gateway, in other words, all the software modules as well as systems and architectures based on the data center firewall.","Erik Suppiger \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Jason Ader, William Blair. Your line is open.","Jason Ader \u2013 William Blair","Yeah. Thank you. John, I wanted to just drill down on the North American enterprise business. If I look at the Americas business, it was up about $7 million sequentially, federal was up $7 million sequentially, so it implies now that federal rule was flat sequentially, but Telco was up $18 million sequentially. I know that probably a lot of that is in the Americas.","So, it sort of implies North American enterprise was down sequentially. I want to get a sense of whether that\u2019s something to be concerned about. If something happened in North America enterprise that disappointed you or was it more of a bookings versus revenue kind of thing?","John McAdam","Yeah. Sort of all of the above, I mean, in terms of concern, as we look out in the pipeline as we look at the current guidance we got this quarter, we see the enterprise business being reasonably strong. I mentioned the financial vertical was definitely lower than what we expect it to be and we expect to see a rebound in that book. That\u2019s the good news. The not so good news is we don\u2019t see Telco being quite as strong this quarter as it was last, still so robust but not quite as strong.","Jason Ader \u2013 William Blair","Like just the technology vertical. For the last quarter, it\u2019s actually been down year-over-year, so I was just kind of wondering what\u2019s happening there. Is that just lumpy?","John McAdam","Yeah. I don\u2019t think there is anything -- I mean, I don\u2019t think there is anything significant there. I mean, I think it was at 19% this quarter, which is typically -- that tends to be the slightly higher end of the range.","Jason Ader \u2013 William Blair","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Brian White, Topeka. Your line is open.","Brian White \u2013 Topeka","Yeah. John, could we talk a little about what you are seeing in the 4G networks? I know you\u2019re a Mobile Congress, I think the number of meetings you had really took it uptick this year. So when do we\u2019re going to see, kind of, the inflection point with the build out of these 4G networks and F5 benefiting?","John McAdam","Yeah. I wouldn\u2019t give a specific time, but if you look at last quarter\u2019s Telco business, we had reasonably lot of sales linked to future deployment of LTE. So, I\u2019m not going to call an inflection point. I think it is now ongoing. And obviously with the acquisition of Traffix, as we look into FY \u201813, we think we could do extremely well in that environment.","Brian White \u2013 Topeka","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Simon Leopold, Raymond James. Your line is open.","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","Great. I wanted to check on two things. One is, your Telco business obviously very strong and it stands out in the sense that this is typically a very tough seasonal quarter for Telco spending and not the case for you. So, if we could get little bit more color as to why your sales in this vertical, kind of, defied the typical seasonality? I understand you\u2019re suggesting it will be down sequentially in June, but help us understand the activity behind that.","And then the other thing I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color on is, I understand you can\u2019t specifically highlight a number for revenue from security, but maybe you could give us a sense of revenue that\u2019s coming from adjacencies to load balancing, that would including WAN optimization security to help us understand the expansion of the addressable market? Thank you.","John McAdam","On the seasonality on Telco, we haven\u2019t seen significant seasonality and that could be linked to the size of our businesses versus some of our larger peers, clearly but not as anything like as big as the Telco. We tend to be project-oriented. So, we win projects that are linked and we\u2019re not just pluming. We tend to be linked very much to the application, the solution and a good idea of what our architecture is going to look like.","We do see add-on as traffic increases and there is a, a lot of things need to manage that traffic. So, as the actual systems are running as well. But the bottom line in Telco -- the bottom answer would be that it\u2019s more project-oriented than anything. We had some pretty strong projects landed last quarter.","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","And the activity in the adjacencies, if you could quantify that?","John McAdam","Well, that\u2019s really the add-on modules that for years we\u2019ve decided never to quantify. I did say that this was very, very strong last quarter and increasing in all the regions as the sale of value and that could be -- security is the leader in that, there is no question with APM and ASM and solutions like that and the access. However, products like WebAccelerator remained very significant player for us, the WAN optimization module as well. But we\u2019re not specific on the numbers.","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","So, just to round that the one question out then, in terms of kind of the newer areas Dan, the Diameter routing in DPI that you haven\u2019t not yet registered revenue and how do you think those are in terms of materiality one or two years from today? Thank you.","Dan Matte","Very significant. I\u2019m not going to be drawn into giving a percent but extremely significant near both areas, that\u2019s what the trends are going, not just in Telco, I think that they\u2019re going to have a capability and a solution-based and the enterprise as well.","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","Thank you.","Operator","Alex Kurtz, Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Alex Kurtz \u2013 Sterne Agee","Thanks for taking the question guys. When you look at the 2400 and sort of the pipelines built for you guys over the last couple of quarters here. You have a sense now about sort of incremental opportunity, can you put a number around it? Can you talk a little bit of any kind of more detail about how that product is helping you especially in sort of mid-tier, mid-range, mid-market kind of enterprise accounts?","John McAdam","As to breaking out the number, we get that as I said every quarter and we don\u2019t break out to that level of detail on product mix. But we have talked some quite a bit about the impact in enterprise and the 2400 there playing very well. The price performance on that box fits right into our range, right around the 8900 and is a great option for people who are looking at expanding environments and we think\u2026","Andy Reinland","No. Still -- v11 is still in the -- whatever that period, I\u2019m not good at this inning thing, but probably that some innings or something. Sorry, my baseball knowledge isn\u2019t that good, but anyway, we are still -- we are not at half time in terms of the v11. That\u2019s going to increase. One of the features on that VCMP is the ability to run multiple versions.","That\u2019s doing well. It grew well from last quarter to the quarter before, but it\u2019s got a long way to go and I think that\u2019s when you really see the chassis\u2019 being filled up by blades, growth towards it. So I think there\u2019s a fairly big runway with the 2400 and the 4480.","Alex Kurtz \u2013 Sterne Agee","So you see that the 2400 sort of getting -- increasingly helping you getting to your numbers every quarter or is it still sort of a smaller portion of the overall pie?","Andy Reinland","It\u2019s very significant.","Alex Kurtz \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Brian Marshall, ISI Group. Your line is open.","Stephen Patel \u2013 ISI Group","Thank you. This is Stephen Patel calling in for Brian Marshall. Can you discuss the progress in your iApps Ecosystem? I believe you had around 35 to 40 iApps at last count a few months ago. Has that increased and have you seen greater penetration in accounts from having those new app delivery capabilities?","Dan Matte","Yeah. Absolutely, Stephen. This is Dan Matte. So we continue to see growth there. We have a team that actually works on iApps day-in and day-out. So internally we are also working with our big application partners like Microsoft and Oracle to try and simplify deployment for a workbook. So that continues to grow. I don\u2019t know off the top of my head, the number I know is more than it was last quarter.","We are seeing that tie into a couple of different places too. One is with continued growth in DevCentral and that continues to be a place, where people pick up on iApps and make use of them and share them with other people.","And then the other thing is we\u2019re using them to help to push into market to penetrate different areas, for example, VDI, where we\u2019ve done a lot of iApps work to help us penetrate the VDI market more successfully and push F5 technology into places that could help people to save money and get better performance.","Stephen Patel \u2013 ISI Group","And a follow-up if I could, there has been more discussion recently around SDN and OpenFlow taking some traffic engineering features out of switches. Can you talk about the opportunities for you and possible changes in the competitive setting in that type of network paradigm?","Dan Matte","We have been following that for quite some time, both sFlow -- not sFlow but the OpenFlow and the OpenStack initiatives. Internally, we have been working towards looking at how that could be adjacent or fit into our business. But in terms of the technology, we see a pretty good synergy with what we do and how that might fit that model, so we expect to work with that in the future to go forward.","Stephen Patel \u2013 ISI Group","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Alex Henderson, Miller Tabak. Your line is open.","Alex Henderson \u2013 Miller Tabak","Thanks. Could you quickly just characterize your thoughts and relative to how you thought the European business did relative to your expectations? You had made that comment last quarter and then the question I really want to ask was around the virtualized market -- the virtual CMP product, the desktop VDI with VMware, can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s progressing. You had made the comment couple of quarters back that your cloud-based business was growing triple digits even if it was on a very small base. Can you kind of put those into some context for us so we\u2019ll have a little bit of granularity on how those pieces are doing?","Mark Anderson","Hey, Alex. I will take the first part of your three-part questions. This is Mark Anderson. So, yeah, we\u2019re really proud of EMEA. I mean as amazing as it seems our businesses has grown there really well year-over-year, sequentially quarter-over-quarter and amazingly consistent across the geographies including Southern Europe where the economies are the tightest. So I think really good execution. Obviously, market-leading technology and a strong work ethic from the team out there.","Dan Matte","And Alex, this is Dan on the rest of it. So, on the cloud front and virtual addition to talk about first. So we continue to see great growth in adoption of our virtual additions. As John mentioned, sequential growth and year-over-year growth that we\u2019re very, very pleased with. We\u2019re not breaking that out as a number of percent, in terms of the cloud piece lots of things going on in that front. We have programs to elect cloud providers adopt our technology with and resale it basically into their environment, into their customers. So we\u2019ve seen a great deal of interest and we\u2019re sort of early days with those programs, but those move forward for us.","On the VDI piece, there are I guess a couple of things going on. One is that we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work in terms of partnering with folks like VMware and Microsoft and coming up with things like wide-eye apps to help to deploy into their and help make their solutions work even better.","And then as I mentioned earlier too with us great solutions that we watched and announced earlier the last quarter from environment like Citrix with their Xen piece and having F5 and BIG-IP fit in and actually in our opinion, work even better than our own products. So that\u2019s been a successful for us too.","Alex Henderson \u2013 Miller Tabak","Just to make a follow-up, on the VMware desktop thing, my understanding is VMware wants to compete very heavily against Citrix in that space and they need ADC to pull it. Obviously, Citrix moves a lot of the net scale or products with that. Can you talk a little bit about how aggressive VMware is relative to pulling you into deals where they\u2019re going after those type of installations and how early is that?","Mark Anderson","Yeah. Sure, Alex. We work with them in the field. I think we have a common enemy in Citrix and I think there is strong motivation on both sides.","Alex Henderson \u2013 Miller Tabak","Good. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Nikos Theodosopoulos, UBS. Your line is open.","Nikos Theodosopoulos \u2013 UBS","Yeah. Thank you. Just a couple of clarifications on Traffix and then a question on service provider, so just so I understood a prior question, did you -- your expectation is that the company will do no revenue next quarter or is there something with deferred and write downs of backlog where you\u2019re not going to be able to recognize anywhere. I\u2019m just trying to understand beyond the next quarter, what should we expect?","And given the number of employees that are coming in, you didn\u2019t mention really anything on OpEx. Once again, do you see that immaterial in the $1 million to $3 million range a quarter, any comments on that?","Andy Reinland","","Yeah. So in terms of OpEx, so we did bring on 60 people as part of our 190 increase and our comments on the press release, we said we\u2019re going to manage that as an investment into our current business model structure and that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it. So we\u2019re still targeting at 38% operating margin as a business and we\u2019re going to bring that in.","In terms of the revenue, definitely there is some carryover revenue in service that we do have to write down. And so the -- there will be very modest revenue as how I would put it, but not enough that we factored it into guidance in any meaningful way.","Nikos Theodosopoulos \u2013 UBS","","Okay. Okay. And that persists for a few quarters? That lack of revenue?","John McAdam","","The way we are viewing it at the moment is fiscal \u201813. As we mentioned, we\u2019re doing a lot of proof-of-concepts. We feel very good about the reaction we are getting from the customer base with the solution clearly LTE is critical. But these tend to be fairly long-term decisions. So really when we look forward fiscal \u201813 is when we really believe we are going to get a payback.","Nikos Theodosopoulos \u2013 UBS","Okay. And then just one final clarification on Traffix deal, just looking at the cash flow statement was the $128 million for acquisitions all tied to that particular deal? I don\u2019t recall any other deals you announced in the quarter?","Andy Reinland","","Yeah. We actually didn\u2019t publicly disclose the details of the deal but, yeah, you are looking at the line and that was specifically for the Traffix acquisition.","Nikos Theodosopoulos \u2013 UBS","","Okay. All right and then my question separate from that was on the service provider business in wireless. Do you have a rough estimate overall as to what percentage wireless is? And if you -- since you probably sell to almost all the wireless carriers, when they do begin an LTE build-out and they already have your products installed, what would be the incremental purchasing that they would need for LTE when they start rolling it out or would your benefit come as they start seeing the increased traffic growth and it\u2019s more a function of subscriber growth coming onto the network?","John McAdam","It\u2019s so difficult to answer the way you\u2019ve referenced the question, because typically we win fairly big projects based on growth of traffic. That\u2019s absolutely, we are receiving traffic, we maybe securing the traffic, we may be doing carrier grades not never to address translation and obviously the diameter knows an extra solution in that basis. So it\u2019s hard to give you a specific feel apart from what we have a fairly growing portfolio and our solutions are absolutely linked to a growth in mobile and the LTE type architectures are coming along.","Mark Anderson","So that\u2019s why the VIPRION platform has been so popular at the service providers, because they can simply add blades and not have to reconfigure their entire network unlike a competitor\u2019s solution where they have to go back in and reapportion VLAN and other network configuration settings that we don\u2019t have to do. So we truly scale these networks, especially when they are starting to point carrier based product interest.","John McAdam","That\u2019s a very good example. That was last quarter with a reasonable sized order that was mainly doing optimization, but also because of VIPRION\u2019s power and its flexibility is also doing some security, firewall security features as well.","Nikos Theodosopoulos \u2013 UBS","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Mark Sue, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. John, it seems the dynamics in Telco s, the uptake with Traffix and security are all better than when you give your 20% year-over-year revenue guidance. And when you add VPI and the ramp in LTE does it make you, you want to look around a conference room table and think 30% growth this year?","John McAdam","","If my memory serves me well, that\u2019s very similar to last quarter\u2019s question. Mark, I maybe wrong in that but I will look back and check but I think I have that 30%. We are not going to update during the year where we are at. We said we would be disappointed with less than 20%. That\u2019s still the case. You heard Andy\u2019s confidence about the second half and stick into that, but we are not going to give any updates. In terms of -- what I will say is...","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","What\u2019s going better John then, what do you say?","John McAdam","","I will say, is what\u2019s becoming clear to us here is that when we look at the core business, we feel good about that. We feel good about our products, the roadmap, the refreshing the 2400 vCMP, v11, et cetera. We feel very good about our security and the ability to do additional business in security and the momentum we\u2019re getting with that and we also feel and I\u2019m really now talking about FY \u201813 that with Diameter and what we\u2019re doing in service provider that we can see an expanding market there as well.","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Good luck, gentlemen.","Operator","","Troy Jensen, Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Troy Jensen \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","Yeah. Thanks for sneaking me in. I\u2019ve got a quick question for Karl and Manny, and I do have a follow-up to this. When you guys talked about security, you talked about really baking off against Cisco, Juniper and some Check Point. Did I hear you guys call Palo Alto, I understand they\u2019re more enterprise, you guys are more data center. Given you\u2019re layer 4 you can look at high levels of streams. Can you move downstream to get it more of the enterprise business and compete more where Palo Alto is competing today?","Manny Rivelo","","This is Manny. Troy, so let me start off by kind of explaining a little bit the used case that we go after. It\u2019s a little different than the used case of Palo Alto, predominantly it goes after. The used case that we provide a lot of value today and that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not going to expand the portfolio. But today it\u2019s really an inbound firewall and what I mean by that is a firewall that\u2019s defending a set of web-based applications and inbound traffic, users from the Internet are coming in to a business trying to access that application.","In that type of environment, what we\u2019re trying to do is provide layer 3 through layer 7 controls. Protect those web applications should beat after-tax application vulnerabilities et cetera. And we are protecting those applications, which are very well defined from millions if not tens of millions or potentially billions of users trying to access those applications. In that situation, our firewall capability not only is much more extensible but also provides deeper visibility, inspection and extensibility to anybody else out there.","The Palo Alto used case does not scale. They stop at about 40-gig from a performance characteristics point of view. We start and keep on going beyond that. So it\u2019s not an equal comparison in the inbound side on the -- what Palo Alto does really well is provide firewall capabilities for an enterprise when an enterprise is trying to access outside to the Internet-based applications. In that situation today, we\u2019re not bringing to market yet a solution.","Troy Jensen \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","Have you guys talked about a timeline for outbound traffic?","John McAdam","","No. We haven\u2019t, Troy. And it\u2019s not eminent either just so we\u2019re clear.","Troy Jensen \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","Okay. Perfect. And how about quickly for Karl. So when I think about SS7 signaling, I guess I think about Telco core versus data centre deployments and I may be wrong. So correct me if I\u2019m, but is Traffix platform going to fit in a different spot at the network than BIG-IP or are we just talking about absorbing some of the 4G signaling into just the data centre piece of signaling?","Karl Triebes","","Well, I mean that the strength of the Traffix platform is its ability to support all the legacy interfaces and SS7 being one of those. So I don\u2019t see why it would sit anyplace different than perhaps where BIG-IP sits in the network. But it\u2019s distinctly different in what we can do with the BIG-IP today, because with the BIG-IP we can scale Diameter, we can connect multiple endpoints, do things like that and scale that traffic, but it\u2019s not per se a full Diameter router with all the very flexible legacy support that the Traffix product has.","Troy Jensen \u2013 Piper Jaffray","","So if an operators adopting Diameter routing, they would need your products in the data centre but they would need other things also, kind of, in the core of the network?","Karl Triebes","In terms of for Diameter, no. I mean we should be able to provide the full Diameter routing capabilities right now.","Troy Jensen \u2013 Piper Jaffray","End-to-end signaling for 4G?","Karl Triebes","End-to-end, yeah.","Troy Jensen \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Perfect. Thanks guys, keep the good work.","Karl Triebes","","Okay.","John Eldridge","","Karl, this is John Eldridge. We\u2019ll take one more question and then end the call.","Operator","","Thank you. Rod Hall, JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Rajat Gupta \u2013 JPMorgan","","Well, hi, this is Rajat Gupta from Rod Hall\u2019s team. I was just wondering if you could comment on FQ4 seasonality. Do you expect that to be similar to prior years? And also if you could comment on the linearity of FQ2 \u201811 used in your core business?","John McAdam","","Sorry, just to be clear, did you say Q4?","Rajat Gupta \u2013 JPMorgan","","Yeah. FQ4 seasonality and the linearity in FQ2.","John McAdam","Yeah. I mean we will give fairly granular guidance for Q4, but we won\u2019t do that until after this current quarter Q3 is complete. Typically, it\u2019s a very strong quarter, but we\u2019ll wait till the next call to talk about the details of that.","Rajat Gupta \u2013 JPMorgan","","Okay. Also could you comment on the linearity of your revenues this quarter and compared to what it was last year and also what kind of visibility do you see this year than you had seen 90 days earlier?","Andy Reinland","Yeah. So the linearity this quarter was actually better than a year ago. I mean the third month being a little bit above 50%. And as far as our visibility, John talked earlier about evaluating our pipeline and looking at the deals and we feel really good about our visibility right now. Deal-by-deal going through it, talking with sales management and definitely on a quarterly basis and even six months out we feel pretty good.","Rajat Gupta \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. Thank you.","John Eldridge","Okay. Thank you very much. We look forward to meeting with many of you during the quarter and to talking with you on next quarter\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, please disconnect at this time.","I now would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Eldridge, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","John Eldridge","Thank you, Sharon. Welcome to our conference call for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The speakers on today's call are John McAdam, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Andy Reinland, Chief Financial Officer and Executive VP, Finance. Other members of our executive team are also with us to answer questions following their prepared comments.","If you have questions after today's call, please direct them to me at (206) 272-6571.","If you don't have a copy of today's press release, it is available on our website at f5.com.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in our quarterly release and described in detail in our SEC filings.","Before we begin, I want to remind you that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.","Now I'll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. In line with the updated guidance we've provided on April 4, revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 was $350.2 million, down 4% sequentially and up 3% year-over-year.","GAAP EPS was $0.80 per share compared to $0.88 per share in Q1 and $0.86 per share in Q2 of last year.","Non-GAAP EPS was $1.07 per share compared to $1.14 per share in the prior quarter and $1.09 per share in the second quarter of fiscal 2012.","Product revenue of $185.1 million represented 53% of total revenue, down 10% from Q2 2012. Service revenue increased 23% from a year ago to $165.1 million, accounting for 47% of revenue.","Revenue from our Application Delivery Networking business was $345.1 million, and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was $5.1 million. Book-to-bill for the quarter was equal to 1.","Revenue from the Americas represented 54% of total revenue, down 4% from Q2 2012. EMEA contributed 23%, up 13% year-over-year. APAC accounted for 16% of revenue, a 21% year-over-year increase; and Japan, 6% of revenue, a 5% decline year-over-year.","During Q2, the financial vertical equaled 23% of total sales. Technology represented 18% and telco accounted for 17%. U.S. federal government was 5% of sales, and total government accounted for 13%.","3 of our distributors each contributed more than 10% of revenue in Q2. Avnet Technologies accounted for 16.3%, Ingram accounted for 13.4% and Westcon accounted for 11.1%.","GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 82.8%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses were $197.5 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $172.7 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 26.4%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34.6%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.2%.","On the balance sheet, below our initial target, but in line with our revenue results, cash flow from operations was $80.7 million, and we ended the quarter with $1.19 billion in cash and investments.","DSO at the end of Q2 was 50 days. Inventories at quarter end were $18 million. Deferred revenue grew to $490.7 million, up 19% from a year ago. We repurchased 508,000 shares of our common stock in Q2 at an average price of $98.31 per share.","Headcount at quarter end was approximately 3,155 employees, a net increase of 30 from the prior quarter.","Now for our Q3 outlook. As John will discuss in more detail, F5's results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 clearly reflected the challenges of doing business in a difficult economic environment. Budgets in general appeared to be more constricted than we had been seeing, which resulted in bill slippage and longer sales cycles, particularly in the telco vertical, as well as U.S. federal sales.","On a more positive note, we are seeing early indications that our new product rollouts are getting traction in the marketplace and anticipate momentum to build as we release the 5000 and the 7000 Series. We are seeing continued strong growth for F5 in the security space, including a very successful first quarter selling of our advanced firewall module.","We are committed to continue investing in technology that aligns with market trends and leads the industry in performance, scalability and ease-of-use. Our top priority remains reaccelerating product revenue growth and, at the same time, maintaining world-class profitability.","For the third quarter, we have set a revenue target in the range of $355 million to $365 million. We expect GAAP gross margin in the 83% range, including approximately $3 million of stock-based compensation expense and $1 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","During Q3, GAAP operating expenses are expected to be in the range of $197 million to $204 million, including approximately $24.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.","We are forecasting an effective tax rate of 36%, and we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%. Our GAAP EPS target is $0.80 to $0.83 per diluted share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.06 to $1.09 per diluted share.","We plan to increase our headcount by 50 to 100 employees during the quarter. We estimate DSOs will be at or around 50 days. We expect inventory levels within the range of $18 million to $20 million. And we expect cash flow from operations in excess of $110 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. As I mentioned in the announcement of our preliminary Q2 results, clearly, our revenue was well below our expectation and internal forecast.","During the quarter, we experienced difficulties in closing certain forecasted deals, as customers hesitated to approve budgets and release purchase orders, causing us to adjust our internal forecast late in the quarter. The slowdown in orders was pronounced in North America and, to a lesser extent, EMEA; while Asia Pacific and Japan came in roughly as planned.","In particular, we experienced significant weakness in our telco vertical, where sales were down significantly on both a year-over-year and sequential basis, as funding for several projects was delayed.","Government sales were also down year-over-year, likely impacted to some degree by the U.S. government sequester. We also experienced a fairly sizable year-over-year drop in orders greater than $1 million in size, a trend that has been ongoing since Q3 of last year. We have looked very closely at the reasons for the shortfall in orders -- of orders in Q2. Our overall view is that most of the shortfall was due to either budget constraints, project timescale being pushed out to later dates or delays in decision-making as customers transition to F5's new range of products we have introduced over the last couple of quarters.","On a positive note, we saw some very encouraging results in Q2 in several areas. We added 2 new Fortune 500 customers and saw a reasonable growth in our Enterprise business, especially in the financial vertical, which was our strongest vertical in Q2 at 23% of overall sales bookings.","Sales of our security products were up significantly in Q2. We had record sales of our application security module, ASM, and a strong start in sales of our new Advanced Firewall Manager, AFM. We started shipping AFM in mid-February and sold AFM solutions to over 50 customers, with most of these sales occurring in the month of March.","With the introduction of AFM, F5 provides the world's fastest and most scalable Application Delivery Firewall solution. F5's firewall solution is the first in the industry to unify a network firewall with traffic management, application security, user access management and DNS security capabilities, all within an intelligent services framework.","We also saw some excellent wins with our access solution, Access Policy Manager, APM. These wins included very large implementation in Fortune 100 companies, where APM is being used to replace existing competitor technologies. The key advantages we offer with the APM includes superior performance and scalability, as well as the extensibility of our access usage modules, including wide VDI support, SSL remote access and simul functionality.","From a platform perspective, we saw a strong traction with our new BIG-IP 4200 platform, which we introduced in Q1. This should bode well for future sales of the new entry-level BIG-IP 2000 Series platforms and the new high-end BIG-IP 10000 Series platforms, both of which started shipping during last quarter.","We also achieved some excellent sales win, replacing Cisco ACE products in large customer accounts, and the pipeline of similar opportunity continues to grow rapidly. We are starting to see a clear pattern with the ACE opportunities, where not only do we replace the existing solutions, but also provide customers additional functionality like DDoS prevention and application security solutions.","Once again, our Services business was solidly profitable on year-over-year growth of 23%. In Q2, we completed the acquisition of LineRate Systems, an early-stage software company based near Boulder. The LineRate Systems technology focuses on solutions that combine open-source tools and software with proprietary technology, enabling web application developers to integrate network services directly into their applications.","The acquisition of LineRate aligns positively with emerging industry trends. Software-defined networking and cloud computing are driving enterprise customers and service providers to reassess how new network and applications are created, deployed and managed.","F5 is the market leader in the delivery of flexible infrastructure to support intelligent network and application services through our ADC platform. The acquisition of LineRate is a strategic fit within our vision, and this technology will extend our capabilities and enable us to further expand our market opportunities.","From an overall roadmap perspective, we have a number of near-term deliverables, which will increase our overall technology leadership, our competitive advantage and to expand growth opportunities in key markets, including security, service providers, cloud-based architectures and new-generation data centers.","Our goal is to start shipping both the BIG-IP 5000 and 7000 Series platforms in this coming quarter. These new platforms will be positioned as our new mid-range BIG-IP appliances, offering significant price performance improvements over our existing mid-range solutions. This will complete the comprehensive product refresh that we started in fiscal 2013.","We also plan to introduce another release of TMOS this quarter, known internally as corona [ph]. The TMOS corona [ph] release includes our new management platform, BIG-IQ. BIG-IQ release 1 includes support for firewall manager and cloud manager. The firewall manager functionality provides enterprises and service providers with a comprehensive management capability to manage large firewall configuration policies. This will support both hardware and software modules, enabling private and public security solutions.","Cloud manager delivers sophisticated management functionality designed to optimize cloud-based architecture and includes the following features: Cloud bridging, to enable private and public clouds to communicate through a secure and optimized connection; Cloud bursting, to expand the resources of our private cloud with resources from a public cloud to address transient work spikes; and cloud application tiering, to host multi-tiered applications in different clouds. For example, a web server can be hosted in a public cloud, and the database server can be hosted in a private cloud, keeping control of sensitive data. BIG-IQ will also offer performance and help monitoring functionalities, as well as public API interfaces.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated we expect to see sequential growth this quarter. We clearly experienced a very cautious spending environment last quarter. However, looking forward, we believe we continue to have significant revenue growth opportunities. With the introduction of the BIG-IP 5000 and 7000 Series, we will have delivered a comprehensive refresh of an entire platform product family, with significant price performance advantages, further increasing our overall competitive advantage. These new products should enable our sales force to aggressively exploit opportunities with the Cisco ACE installed base and offer customers a full suite of solutions available on our new platforms.","We continue to make steady progress in our sales of software-only and hybrid software system solutions. We expect this momentum to continue with the expansion of our industry-leading range of hypervisor support. These solutions can now support customers' data centers and cloud environments when -- with unprecedented performance.","Clearly, we were very disappointed with the results in the service provider market last quarter. However, we have a strong pipeline and are convinced that we have a winning strategy with our intelligent services platforms that can consolidate complex traffic steering, carrier-grade NAT solutions, application and network firewall protection and our policy enforcement module.","Also, we are seeing good success and initial project wins with our Traffix Systems Diameter solutions for LTE deployments. And over the past year, we have closed wins with more than 25 operators worldwide. Perhaps our best opportunity for future growth comes from our unique security solution portfolio. In particular, our new Application Delivery Firewall solution provides our enterprise and service provider customers the ability to integrate essential security capabilities and protect their applications, data and users.","As I mentioned earlier, F5's Application Delivery Firewall solution is the first in the industry to combine DDoS protection, the world's fastest network firewall application security, access management and DNS security, as well as comprehensive traffic management functionality.","I remain very excited about the future prospects for F5. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the F5 team and our partners and look forward to continued support for the rest of the year.","So with that, we'll hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Ader of William Blair.","Jason Ader - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I have 1 clarification and then 1 question. And the clarification is, when you guys talked about book-to-bill, Andy, is that total sales or just product book-to-bill? And then, secondly, could you talk about your thoughts on the services growth? It's still very strong, over 20%. But if I just kind of use the same cadence that we had from sequential  December to March, it looks like it's going to, from a year-over-year growth standpoint, pretty closely -- or pretty soon get to kind of like mid-teens. So is that the right way to think about the services growth, or is there something else going on in services that could reaccelerate the sequential services growth?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So to the first part of your question, when we talked book-to-bill, for us, that is strictly product, strictly product, yes. And then, in terms of services, yes, you're right, we've long talked about that. But when you look at our Services business and the growth there, it does correlate to product, and we have seen the product grow slow, which is why it's so important for us, and our #1 priority is reaccelerating product revenue. And I think we're seeing that play out over a more elongated time. But there's nothing within Services a business itself that's still really high rates in terms of maintenance renewals. We're doing very well in the consulting area, actually, which we think is critical for us, in driving that reaccelerated product revenue growth. So nothing systemic there to worry about.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian White of Topeka.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I'm just wondering if you feel like the product cycle year-over-year growth has bottomed in the March quarter. It looks like it's down 10% year-over-year. Should we see an acceleration from this level?","John McAdam","Yes. Given the GAAP that we saw on our guidance versus the actual, we're going to be pretty cautious about talking medium to long term and really stick to the quarter guidance. Having said that, we do expect to see a driver -- a business driver coming now that we've effectively -- well, certainly with the 5000 and 7000 coming this quarter, we will effectively have completed the product refresh and see growth in that. Also, I -- as I mentioned in the list I was giving of drivers, I think security is definitely a big opportunity from a product growth perspective as well.","Brian John White - Topeka Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just -- if I look back at March quarter, it's pretty amazing because there was never -- other than the second quarter of '09, there was never a March quarter that fell this much. So during the financial crisis it fell 7%. Here, we fell 4%. It begs the question, do you feel like we're in a recession or going into recession? I mean...","John McAdam","I think -- yes. I think we've really come down to 2 issues. The first issue is definitely macro. I'm not going to call it recession, but definitely macro issues. And we've seen that obviously with peers. But I think whatever is exaggerated with us is obviously the telco performance. And that's -- that was more project slipping. I mean, interestingly enough, we put a pretty strong start here in April, which is encouraging that we're only talking 3 weeks, remember, so -- but it's encouraging, especially in the telco vertical.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brian Marshall of ISI Group.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","We've uncovered some social media guys that probably are migrating off sort of the ADC platforms and are doing this more from a home-grown or a open-source standpoint, that 437 [ph]. I guess, the question is, what makes you think that the telco guys can't do a 437 more from a software standpoint going forward? And basically, we're starting to see the early signs of this market kind of secularly moving away from us as opposed to just some cyclical impact from the order books. So would love some commentary there and a quick follow-up, if I could.","John McAdam","Yes. And we've alluded to that in the past -- sorry, fairly recent quarters, Brian, where we've seen a small number, and we're talking of a very small number of some of the larger web monster-type solution providers deciding to do their own. And Google's software has always been close to the poster child for that. But, yes, we've seen a very, very small number. Typically, the application mix tends to be more straightforward, and there tends to be a need to get to roll out apps very, very quickly in that type of environment. That's not the case in the service provider space, and it's certainly not the case in the enterprise either. So we don't see anything like the same threat there. Now having said that, remember, our strategy has been to take our ADC platform and continue to add solutions to it. So for example, we think our security solutions that we've added pretty rapidly and are seeing great success is a great counterbalance to that trend. But you're not just doing simple load balancing, you're doing much more complex either application optimization or security. And so, I mean, that's our strategy, and I feel pretty good about that.","Brian Marshall - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And really quickly, you mentioned that security was running [ph]. Could you break out the security revenues for us in the quarter...","John McAdam","It's just sort of hard to do that. I mean, we have examples. We've looked a number of wins, some of them approaching the million-dollar range, where -- I'll give you 1 example. One example is a large financial organization, U.S. organization, where our first entry into that actually was doing some Oracle optimization using iRules in areas like that, but it also allowed us to get our application security manager into the sale to actually replace and chucked out one of our major competitors -- our major competitor. So what do you call that? Is that security? Is it traffic steering? What is it? So it's so difficult to say. But when we look at the ASM modules -- and we don't give out just the software solutions. As I said, that was a record quarter, and we did get some view of the AFM, the application firewall we sense will lead to pretty big systems behind it. So that's, for me, the best information we can give you.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Notter of Jefferies.","George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to ask you about your referencing lumpiness in the service provider business. I guess, I was just curious about how many operators we're talking about, how many particular deals were involved, how big were those deals. I mean, any more flavor you could give us for that lumpiness would be great. And I guess, I'm just trying to understand maybe more root cause rather than just a general -- or is it more just a general broad-brush statement about service provider budgets and then timing of those being released. Any more flavor would be great.","John McAdam","Absolutely. And it's not a general broad-brush statement. Specifically, in North America, it was much more project-oriented. That's pretty important. And as I said, we think we've started a quarter in a pretty good light here. We're seeing some of these projects being released. It was very much that. Now we did see globally a downtick in service provider. We did see that. But mostly those are project oriented, we've said many times in the past that we don't really see a service provider linked completely to the CapEx thing. I mean, it's obviously to some degree, but it's much more project-oriented. And hopefully, last quarter was an anomaly.","George C. Notter - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Was this 3 providers, 5 providers? I mean, how many operators were involved here?","John McAdam","If you look at North America, we're talking Tier 1 type of providers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Thompson of FBR Capital.","Scott Thompson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","There has been a little bit of talk with other security-type companies of carriers pushing them from a CapEx model to more of an OpEx-type purchasing model. Are guys getting any kind of pressure to do that kind of a transaction as well?","John McAdam","Not really. It's not something we've seen, and we have a number of ongoing type of discussions with service providers and security. But, no, we haven't seen that.","Manuel F. Rivelo","The only thing I would add, and this is Manny, to that comment is that we're seeing with some of the cloud providers who are going to more of a model, where they want to pay, if you will, by the bid or by the day, and those situations obviously, we're seeing it there. But that's more in the cloud provider, not the traditional telco.","Scott Thompson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And carriers haven't approached you about virtualized platforms or network function virtualization or anything like that either, right?","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes, that they are approaching us with, and we've been talking to them about that. Obviously, that's a big use case. They're all looking at that over the next -- over the horizon, I would say, the next -- I'd say 3 to 5 years. That's their intent to deploy. The great news is all of our software modules are supported across all the industry major hypervisors. So we think we're in a great position to capitalize on that, and we've been talking to various providers and network equipment providers also about our solutions there.","John McAdam","And that's why I took some time -- in my introduction, I talked about BIG-IQ. Pardon the pun here, but BIG-IQ is a really big deal in this environment because of its ability to optimize and move applications around the clouds around it within the data center private to public, et cetera, et cetera.","Scott Thompson - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","All right. And then, one other quick question, if I may. The projects that are being released this quarter that are driving the strength in service provider, are those from the same service providers that drove the miss?","John McAdam","Oh, no. We're not linking products being released with the projects and service provider. It doesn't mean there is not an overlap, but that's all -- we're talking about projects coming to fruition and that could be with older products. It could be with new products. It's not linked to the actual product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rohit Chopra of Wedbush.","Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. How do you know that there isn't a trade-down effect or a competition impacting the business? And the other part that I wanted to ask was, how do you know that the release of the 5000 and the 7000 won't cause another potential pause in the business, as people evaluate?","John McAdam","Yes. And obviously, on the latter part, there may be some element of that. I think we've taken that into account now when we gave our guidance. So that's possible. Having said that, the 2000 entry-level. The 10000, of course, are moving into the second quarter and it hopefully will benefit the way the 4200 did. So there, I think, is give-and-take there. On the first question regarding competition, one of the things we did say -- on our pre-announcement, we said we are seeing some more engagements with competition. There's no question about that, especially because of the ACE opportunity that -- obviously, everybody's looking at that, and we're seeing a little bit of a ramp-up there. But our competitive win rates, which we follow very, very closely, very closely. We look at revenue, we look at the number of engagements and we look at the win rate in both, and that's still very solid for us. And not only that, we're increasing our functionality. Security, we're doing really well in. Access, we're doing really well in. When we talk to the sales force -- and you can imagine we've had a laser focus in doing that, we basically are not hitting anything different from them. I mean, we're not dismissing competition. Don't get me wrong, but we don't see a significant change, and we absolutely -- when we look at the deals that slipped last quarter and didn't come to fruition, it's actually hard to find any that were competitive losses. In other words...","Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Any evidence of trade-downs, John?","John McAdam","What do you mean by trade-downs?","Rohit N. Chopra - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] higher-end products, and maybe they're looking...","John McAdam","Yes, I think there should be some of that. I think, definitely -- we are talking about pretty significant price performance advantages, the 2400 -- the VIPRION 2400, that's been incredibly successful, has probably increased, taken some of the low end of the higher end of the VIPRION. Does that make sense? So to some degree, yes. But the other side to that is the attach rate in software modules is going up. So there is a balance there, as -- okay, you're getting a better price performance from the products, but you can add more software modules to it. So that comes into play as well.","Karl D. Triebes","Yes. This is Karl by the way. I'm just going to add to that, Rohit, that we're also allowing more modules to run, in fact, all the modules down to the lowest end platforms. And so, we expect that to help drive software sales, and we have vCMP running on most of our appliances well now. So we'll expect that to extend -- we'll extend that. So we're adding more software services straight down the lineup.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Bergan of Craig-Hallum.","Ryan R. Bergan - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I apologize if I missed this, but when you talked about service provider deals that slipped out of the last quarter into the current quarter, we're you also -- we're you addressing total deals that slipped including U.S. federal, or was that just a service provider comment?","John McAdam","Specifically, the comment was -- I was talking about service provider. I did say that -- and I'm going to repeat here, we're only in 3 weeks of the quarter, right? So I don't -- although it's important to us because we really do check our business weekly. We have seen a fairly good start across-the-board not just in service provider, but especially in service provider.","Ryan R. Bergan - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Would you characterize in these first 3 weeks -- and I understand it's early that you're seeing -- have you started to see any of those U.S. federal deals that slipped hit here in the June quarter?","John McAdam","You know what? I don't know if I know the answer to that, specifically.","Ryan R. Bergan - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I understand that you only give guidance out for 1 quarter. But kind of give me some of your general thoughts on September quarter, U.S. federal with being in the fiscal year end. And do you see -- what kind of generalities do you see with the September quarter, the U.S. fed business this year versus maybe last year?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So with the federal business -- I mean, you're right. September quarter is the year end for government. And historically, for us, that's been a strong quarter and now it included our last Q4 in that comment. I probably won't give you any color on the coming September quarter. We'll do that on our next call, but it will be the end of the year for the federal government. So we'll see on that.","Ryan R. Bergan - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then one more for me. It looks like the technology segment was down year-on-year again. I'm just wondering if you feel like you've seen a bottom in that vertical yet, or if you feel like it's being impacted a bit from the macro here and that it's still maybe too soon to call the bottom on that vertical?","Andy Reinland","Well, I guess I'd look at it from last quarter where it was 13% and then, this quarter, came back to 18%. So I don't know the year-over-year off the top of my head, but I think we have talked on previous calls that we have seen some impact of some of our key customers developing their own very basic load balancing there. But we think we're executing well on diversifying new with our other offerings into that space and expanding that area, which is technology for us is very broad. But actually, I was happy to see it go from -- up to 18% this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Andy, I wanted to understand again -- on the carrier comments, it looks like, relative to your original guidance, you're about $25 million if we take the midpoint of the guide. And just looking at the run rate you're running at now and the service provider is about $60 million, it feels like you're -- $20 million out of that $25 million was roughly from that vertical, correct me if I'm wrong. Magnitude was very roughly in that range. Now if you're under the assumption that telco is off to an okay start as John mentioned, why should we not see a much greater snapback into this quarter in this vertical? I'm struggling to understand why this is not going to be close to an $80 million to $100 million business this quarter rather than what's your guidance implying another flat quarter for it.","John McAdam","I'm jumping in here to answer. [indiscernible] Look, we're 3 weeks in, first of all. Secondly, I do -- we do have a good pipeline. I feel good about a lot of the drivers. But we had a big miss last quarter. And given that scenario, I think you have to be cautious. And in fact, I think cautious is being prudent. So hopefully, we're being appropriately cautious and prudent.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And as a follow-up, John, you talked about the decline in the $1 million orders. But can you talk about that in the context of carrier versus enterprise? Is the same -- do you see the same deceleration in both enterprise $1 million deals, as well as service provider? Or is this distinct to the service provider vertical?","John McAdam","I'm not sure if I really know the answer to that. I -- yes, I was going to give you a gut-feel answer. Let me put it this way. In the service provider pipeline, we have good $1-million-plus deals. So my instincts are it's probably more on the enterprise side. But that's maybe something we'll check. And then, when we have another public forum, we can address that.","John Eldridge","Sharon, this is John Eldridge. We're going to take 2 more questions and then sign off.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi.","Amitabh Passi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just had a couple on my end. First, John, where do you think we are with the Cisco ACE replacement process? Wondering if you can maybe give us a status update on deals and also whether or not you're seeing any sort of a renewed vigor from the Cisco-Citrix partnership? And then, just as a follow-up, I would love to get your thoughts on Diameter signaling, particularly given the recent acquisition made by Oracle. How do you sort of compete against them in this market?","John McAdam","Yes. On the first question regarding ACE, I mentioned -- I think it's a really good opportunity for us. I think that opportunity is going to last a while. I mean, I wouldn't put a timescale on it, but awhile.  But more importantly, and we'd said this a number of times, when we're winning, especially in the bigger accounts, that doesn't need to be Fortune 500, but Fortune 500 large organizations. The chances of us doing repeat business and the chances of us expanding our solution portfolio is really, really high. It's a big chunk of our pipeline now, the ACE opportunity. The actual close rates are pretty reasonable, and our competitive win rate has been excellent -- has been really excellent. Now having said that, we don't dismiss the Cisco-Citrix partnership. We've seen it in some areas. But more often than not, we tend to be competing head-to-head with a competitor without Cisco being too much involved.","Manuel F. Rivelo","[indiscernible]","John McAdam","Oh, sorry, yes. And then, the Traffix Systems will -- yes, we feel really good about the Diameter solution, the Diameter product. We think it's the best out there. We thought that before the take-away [ph] acquisition. I don't know what will happen. Acme would also compete in that space. I'm not sure what will happen there. Obviously, that's up to Oracle. But there was really 3 before. And I think that we have -- the deal with us here is basically to get more and more projects to make sure we're partnering with the right partners, and I think that's a good strategy to do that. And I'm very hesitant here because Oracle is a great partner of ours, right? So there is coopetition also a great customer. So -- but I do think the Diameter solution is a great opportunity. Manny?","Manuel F. Rivelo","Yes. And I'll just add 1 comment to that. In the comments, the Diameter business is going as we projected. It's early in the market, as you all know. LTE is rolling out. As LTE rolls out, the complexity of those networks increases, and that's really when you need the DRA and DEA solutions that are in the market segment. So what we've seen is a huge ramp-up in the number of deals that we're being invited to. From an ARX [ph] point of view, we're seeing more proof-of-concepts out there than ever before. And over the last, I would say, 45 days or so, we've seen an interest from a lot of the operators who had already gone with some solutions prior to us entering the market, re-approaching us in that arena for our portfolio. So we're pretty excited. We think it's going according to plan. Obviously, time will tell.","Operator","And our last question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to ask about virtual ADC broadly and then, specifically, what you're seeing with the ADC at some of the large consumer cloud customers in the tech vertical on their usage patterns with that software-based solution.","Dan Matte","This is Dan, Jayson. The pattern that we're seeing with that type of customer basically is that they tend to associate the virtual versions down more closely with the application. So as opposed to somebody that would embrace, say, a VIPRION-type solution where you'd see that deploy with, sort of, closer-to-the-edge higher capacity requirements, all the benefits that a hardware solution brings, the vADC [ph] seems to be spread more deeply in their infrastructure and, actually, I'd say, is well within the enterprise. And last quarter, we saw a couple of very nice deals that were driven by that type of adoption.","John McAdam","The other thing is that -- a couple of things on vADC [ph] that I want to push again is our performances is really fantastic, and our hypervisor support is second to none. But the big deal, I think, is the fact that this BIG-IQ management capability, we're talking about software and systems as one across different data centers. So I think we're really well placed there. But it's still early days.","Karl D. Triebes","Yes -- and this is Karl. By the way, I'll also add that we will shortly be releasing higher performance versions of our VE's across all the hypervisors, including a new hypervisor that runs in Amazon cloud. And we'll be introducing more cloud-based service as well. And this, again, as John was saying, ties very nicely to our BIG-IQ cloud manager, where we can actually move traffic between clouds and the users to either private cloud or data center. It doesn't matter to us.","Dan Matte","Right. And integrate with our partners' orchestration systems and managements systems, which is a vital piece of that solution as well.","Karl D. Triebes","Yes.","Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Is the tech vertical the largest opportunity for what you're talking about here?","Karl D. Triebes","I think tech is a big one, but enterprise as well.","Dan Matte","I think it's broad-based.","John Eldridge","Okay. Well, thank you, all, very much for joining us on this call, and we'll do our best to have an update call next quarter. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

During today's call, our discussion will contain forward-looking statements which include words such as believe, anticipate, expect and target.","These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. Factors that may affect our results are summarized in our quarterly release and described in detail on our SEC filings. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.","Before we begin the call, I want to remind you that we are holding our 2012 analyst\/investor meeting in New York on November 15. If you are planning to attend the meeting and have not registered, we invite you to register online through the link on our IR Events Calendar entry on November 15. I hope you can join us in New York for that event.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. F5's fiscal 2012 was a year of solid execution in a difficult macroeconomic environment. We were able to achieve 20% revenue growth, maintain world-class operating margins and delivered record earnings and cash flow while developing products and services that set the stage for several years of continued revenue growth. Following discussion of results for the fourth quarter and for fiscal year 2012, we will provide guidance for Q1 2013 and outline our general planning assumptions and expectations for the year.","As a reminder, all non-GAAP numbers excludes stock-based compensation expense and amortization of purchased intangible assets. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included with our press release.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, revenue of 362.6 million was within our guided range of 360 million to 370 million, up 3% from the prior quarter and 15% from the fourth quarter a year ago. Book to bill for the quarter was equal to one. Q4 product revenue of 209.7 million, up 6% from the fourth quarter of last year, represented 58% of revenue.","Service revenue of 152.8 million increased 30% year-over-year and accounted for 42% of revenue. Q4 revenue from our core application delivery networking business was 356.8 million and revenue from our ARX file virtualization business was 5.8 million.","On a regional basis, the Americas grew 8% year-over-year and represented 56% of revenue. EMEA representing 22% of overall revenue grew 29%. APAC at 15% of revenue grew 31% and Japan 7% of revenue grew 13% from a year ago.","By vertical, telco represented 19% of sales during the quarter, technology 17% and financial 20%. Total government was 17% of sales, including 10% from US Federal. During Q4 we had two greater than 10% distributors; Avnet Technologies which accounted for 16.8% of total revenue and Ingram Micro which represented 12.8%.","Continuing down the income statement, GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 82.7%, non-GAAP gross margin was 84%. Operating expenses of 188 million were at the low end of our 188 million to 195 million guided range. And non-GAAP operating expenses were 164.6 million. GAAP operating margin was 30.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 38.6%.","Other income for the quarter was 900,000. The Company's GAAP and non-GAAP net income for the quarter reflect the higher than expected effective tax rate. This resulted from a higher than expected impact of foreign permanent tax differences and a higher blended effective state tax rate which increased our GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter to 39.9%, above our expectation of 35.5%.","Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 37% above our 34% expectation. These higher than anticipated tax rates had an impact of approximately $0.06 to GAAP EPS and $0.05 to non-GAAP EPS. Reflecting the higher tax rate for the quarter, GAAP net income for Q4 was 67.7 million or $0.85 per diluted share below our guided range of $0.90 to $0.93. Non-GAAP net income was 88.7 million or $1.12 per diluted share, also below our guided range of $1.16 to $1.19.","Revenue for all fiscal 2012 was 1.38 billion, up 20% from fiscal 2011. GAAP net income for fiscal 2012 was 275.2 million or $3.45 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was 348.6 million or $4.37 per diluted share.","Turning to the balance sheet, in Q4 we generated 148.6 million in cash flow from operations which contributed to cash and investments totaling 1.19 billion at year end. For all of fiscal 2012, cash flow from operations totaled $495 million.","DSO was 46 days. Inventory at the end of the quarter was 17.4 million. Deferred revenue increased 30% year-over-year to 447.3 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were 11.3 million. During the quarter, we added 125 employees ending the year with approximately 3,030 full-time employees. For the fiscal year, we added 540 employees, an increase of 22%. ","In Q4 we repurchased approximately 514,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $97.29 per share for a total of 50 million. Approximately 180 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.","Moving on to our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year '13 outlook. We are weighing a number of factors as we determine guidance for Q1 and assess our growth prospects for fiscal year '13. As we have referenced several times over the year, we do anticipate typical fiscal Q1 seasonality.","We also recognize that our short-term visibility continues to be limited by the macroeconomic uncertainty which caused many of our customers to slow or reduce spending in the second half of fiscal 2012, particularly in the case of larger million dollar plus type opportunities.","At the same time we are anticipating a very positive reception to the new products and platforms that we will be introducing in fiscal 2013. Throughout the year, we are rolling out a powerful lineup of new hardware platforms, software products and significant performance increases to our virtual products that will drive new and increased growth for F5.","We also see momentum building in customer engagements for our diameter signaling products from the Traffix acquisition and believe this will drive material revenue in fiscal year '13.","Lastly, we see a very real market share opportunity with the recent announcement from Cisco to cease development of its ACE product line and we are being very aggressive in our efforts to capture this opportunity. In consideration of these factors, for the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we are targeting revenue in the range of 363 million to 370 million.","We are forecasting GAAP gross margins to remain in the 83% range, including approximately 3 million of stock-based compensation expense and 1 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We estimate GAAP operating expense of 193.5 million to 198.5 million, including approximately 25.5 million of stock-based compensation expense.","We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 37% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $0.86 to $0.88 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.14 to $1.16 per share. We expect DSO in the mid-to-high 40-day range. We anticipate inventories in the range of 17 million to 19 million. We plan to increase our headcount by approximately 100 employees during the quarter, and we believe we will generate cash flow from operations in excess of 145 million.","For fiscal 2013, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows. We expect to see sequential revenue growth throughout the year with more robust product growth in the back half of the year, as demand builds related to our forthcoming product refresh and new security and service provider software modules.","We anticipate GAAP gross margins consistent with our Q1 guidance of 83%. We are targeting non-GAAP operating margins for the year to be at or around 38% with some seasonal fluctuation as margins will be a bit lower in the first half and stronger in the second half.","We expect stock-based compensation expense to approximate Q1 levels until our next annual grant in August. Capital expenditures are expected to be 6 million to 12 million per quarter with some quarter-to-quarter variability related to investments.","And consistent with Q1, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 37% on a GAAP basis and 34.5% on a non-GAAP basis throughout the year. These tax assumptions do not assume a reinstatement of the R&D tax credit.","As John mentioned, we will be holding our analyst\/investor meeting at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York on November 15. We look forward to seeing you there.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon everyone. I'll take a few minutes to discuss F5's performance in fiscal 2012, talk in more detail about our Q4 results and then comment on our outlook and the exciting opportunities we see going into fiscal 2013.","I was very pleased with the F5 team's performance in fiscal 2012. In spite of a difficult macroeconomic environment, especially in the second half of the year, we achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 20% with world-class non-GAAP operating margins above 38%.","We accomplished this while investing significantly in additional headcount, increasing our total net headcount by 540 employees, ending the year with a total of 3,030 employees. We exited fiscal 2012 with a stable balance sheet with almost $1.2 billion in cash and investments and no debt, having purchased 185 million of our common stock during the year.","Sales of our VIPRION chassis-based products were particularly strong with year-over-year growth of 107%, driven by strong adoption of the mid-range VIPRION 2400 system, as well as sales of the high-end VIPRION systems into the service provider markets.","In addition our overall software sales increased by 38%, driven by a significant increase in software module attach rates and strong growth in sales of the software only versions of our product portfolio. The growth in our software attach rate clearly benefits our business model and is also critical to our market expansion strategy.","We have made tremendous progress in expanding our opportunities into key markets, including security, service provider and cloud-based architectures. In security we now have the most comprehensive integrated solution in the industry that includes our application firewall, ASM and a remote access solution, APM.","Software revenue from our security modules was approximately $55 million last year, up 90% from the previous year. This is software only revenue and doesn't include the service revenue, the associated BIG-IP of VIPRION hardware, incremental ADC revenue or any of the revenue from the datacenter firewall solution.","In the service provider market, our ability to deliver intelligent policy enforcement, at world class performance levels continues to be a key capability for managing the challenge of ever expanding increase in mobile data. Our high-end VIPRION platform combined with the application fluency of TMOS and the flexibility of features like iRules gives service providers a unique opportunity to build value-added services.","We also made good progress with sales of carrier grade NAT, firewall, IPv6 and traffic steering solutions. I'm also very pleased with the progress we are making with the acquisition of Traffix Systems that was completed mid fiscal 2012. The Traffix team is world class and we are proud to have them as part of the F5 family.","As I mentioned last quarter, we believe the opportunity with the Traffix Diameter-based solutions will prove to be both significant and strategic to our overall service provider business. The Traffix pipeline has been growing nicely as service provider roll out their LTE architects and adopt Diameter as a standard signaling protocol. I'll talk more about this when I discuss our fiscal 2013 opportunities.","Our services business delivered strong performance consistently throughout fiscal 2012 and continued to be a significant profit and revenue growth contributor, while maintaining customer satisfaction at world-class levels. The attach rate of service to product sales continues to improve and we want to again experience excellent renewal rates.","We also continue to grow our consulting business which increases customer satisfaction and drives additional product revenues. As far as Q4 is concerned, I'm very pleased with our results. We delivered 15% year-over-year growth in spite of a cautious spending environment.","From a geographic perspective, both EMEA and our Asia-Pacific regions had solid sales bookings growth. In North America we saw reasonable sales growth for orders up to $1 million in size, but a drop-off in sales orders above $1 million, as customers postponed large purchases or reduced to size of the purchase order.","Overall, our Q4 financial performance was very strong. Quarterly cash \u2013 free cash flow was over $137 million, a record for the Company and the non-GAAP operating margins remained solid at 38.6%. Our services business completed the year with another strong quarter and a very healthy deferred revenue balance moving into fiscal 2013.","As far as the outlook is concerned, it's appropriate to be cautious given the very conservative spending environment we saw in the second half of fiscal 2012. Having said that, we believe we have a number of exciting opportunities coming in fiscal 2013 to drive revenue growth and we plan to continue to invest in our business to take advantage of those opportunities.","We increased our sales force in 2012 by approximately 20% and we expect to see the benefits of this investment throughout the year. We have a clear and growing leadership position in the ADC market. Our goal is to continue expanding our addressable markets and further increase our market share by developing a broad array of integrated solutions running on industry-leading platforms.","During the next two quarters, we will be delivering our largest appliance refresh in four years. Our next release of TMOS includes a number of new security and service provider offerings as well as products to enable cloud architectures. For example, we will be releasing the industry's first application delivery firewall, ADF, that integrates Level 3 to Level 7 security including [the] [ph] loss prevention and unique application fluency to prevent sophisticated application attacks.","ADF provides performance metrics clearly superior to those offered by our competitors. We will also be delivering the industry's broadest range of hypervisor support of world-class performance levels. For the service provider market, we will be delivering additional carrier grade NAT functionality and a new software module, as well as a policy enforcement module with DPI classification technology.","Additionally we expect to release a new eight-slot version of our VIPRION that will leverage the PB 300 blades released last quarter and effectively double the unmatched performance of VIPRION 4480, our current high-end platform. As I mentioned earlier, we also expect to benefit from the rollout of LTE infrastructures with our Traffix Systems signaling delivery controller and diameter solutions.","The pipeline for these products is building steadily and we're seeing a fairly large uptake in RFP and proof-of-concept request. F5 has the opportunity to be a leader in this area which will not only provide growth opportunities over the next three years, but should also significantly enhance our position as a strategic supplier to global service providers. We will review our product roadmap deliverables as well as our market initiatives in more detail at the analyst and investor meeting in November.","Andy provided a projected revenue range as well as some of the high-level expectations for fiscal 2013. As I mentioned several times over the last couple of years, we expect to see some seasonality in our business during Q1. The first quarter seasonality, which is normal in the technology market and in line with our peers, is reflected in our guidance.","Acceleration of product revenue growth is the major financial goal for fiscal 2013. I remain very optimistic of the future of F5 as we enter fiscal 2013. We enjoy a very strong competitive position and I believe our fiscal 2013 product deliverables are the most comprehensive we have seen in several years. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the entire F5 team and partners for the tremendous efforts last year and I look forward to the continued support in fiscal 2013.","And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Paul Silverstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse","Yeah, I'm looking at the numbers. It looks like you had a huge US Federal, up over 70%, but you\u2019re down in financials vertical over 10% and telecom was also down over 10% sequentially. I'm trying to tie this together with the geographic comments. It looks like you had a good quarter everywhere, but in the Americas based on the numbers. Is this a function specifically of financials, large deals, in your commentary weakening? And how much of this \u2013 I know the numbers are still small with respect to virtual additions, but in your commentary you noted that there was a big spike off albeit off a small base, but is that starting to have an impact on the revenues?","John McAdam","Yeah, first of all, I don't think the virtualizations are having any significant impact whatsoever. The numbers of all are great in terms of percentage growth. They're obviously pretty small in total. So I don't think that's an issue. Now we spent a lot of time on this after the quarter and frankly during the quarter, but we're pretty convinced when we look at the spending part of the large Fortune 500 companies generally, obviously finances or the whole chunk of them was in the Fortune 500, but generally there is definitely a cautious spending environment. And as I said when I was doing my introduction, the spending part is actually pretty reasonable if you compare 200k to 500k, 500k to a $1 million year-over-year. However, and this is mainly in North America because this is where most of our large bills tend to come from, when you get to the $1 million plus bill, we definitely seen a \u2013 saw a slowing there, and I should say, in the quarter and generally in the second half.","Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse","John, was that specific to any of those big deals or most of those concentrated in the financial vertical or was it really spread more broadly across your base? And I also got a question about the linearity of the quarter, if you could give us any insight on that?","John McAdam","Okay. No, they weren't really concentrated that much in financials, there are examples of that, but not so much. Service provider definitely was lower, I mean at 19%. That's really towards the low end where we saw some slowness there, but not specifically in financials.","Andy Reinland","And then to linearity, Paul, really what we saw is what we've seen over the last two quarters where a little above 50%, we normally follow the 50 first two months, 50 third month. The last three quarters have been a couple of points higher than that, but consistent over the last three quarters.","Paul Silverstein - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Barclays. Your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal - Barclays","Yes, gentlemen, thanks very much. I have a couple of questions. I think number one, the verticals that you were discussing were both lumpy up and lumpy down, depending on the vertical. How sustainable do you think the federal strength is into the fourth quarter? And then similarly should we be expecting the telco vertical to be recovering? And then Andy, for you in particular, I think in the past you've talked about the March quarter being a possible exception to the sequential growth for the year. Can we confirm that you are not making that exception this year?","John McAdam","In terms of the verticals, first of all, I guess this is pretty obvious, but the US Federal we definitely expect to be down sequentially from the year-end, which is extremely normal. But we feel very good about the team and the job they did and the relative year-over-year performance that we would expect to see throughout the year. So that's one thing. The second question was\u2026","Andy Reinland","Was based on the sequential revenue growth\u2026?","Jeff Kvaal - Barclays Capital","Yes, but John before you leave the verticals, how about telco?","John McAdam","Yeah, we're actually assuming a relatively slow telco for the first \u2013 for next quarter. That could possibly bleed into the March quarter as well, but we're not talking about that yet, but definitely if we look forward to the gains that we've given, we aren\u2019t expecting a strong service provider in Q1.","Andy Reinland","And then to the sequential revenue growth, you're absolutely right. If we look back over time in particular going back three, four, five years, March probably has been our most difficult quarter just based on seasonality and that's led by North America. What we've highlighted over the last couple of years is that we've really seen as we've grown to $1 billion and beyond that we've seen definite seasonality in our December quarter which is our Q1. And so as we look at the layout over the year, and we highlighted and you see it in our guidance our view on Q1 and we think off of that comparison we can grow in March now. But we're also highlighting that we think from a product basis, it will be stronger in the second half of the year versus the first half.","John McAdam","Yeah, the other point about that is that \u2013 the really big deal for us I think is going to be the release of [SOL] [ph] with the functionality we talked about as well as the product refresh. We are absolutely \u2013 and we'll talk more about this in the Analyst Day that's coming up, but we are clearly pushing very hard to get them available by the end of this calendar year. So if we achieve that, then I would expect to see some reasonably quick growth coming from that refresh which would obviously hit the March quarter.","Jeff Kvaal - Barclays Capital","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Choi with Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Bill Choi - Janney Capital Markets","Thanks. A couple of questions on the products. First, what was ARX contribution in the quarter? And also when I think about big deals, I immediately think VIPRION 4400, but your commentary seems to indicate strength also on the 4400. So can you talk about what the larger products in your portfolio are doing and are they still getting a digital module attach rate, more the chassis deployment issues? Thanks.","John McAdam","Yeah, just on the last part there \u2013 remember that was a year-over-year number in terms of VIPRION sales. However, they've been pretty solid quarterly right throughout the year. And one of the characteristics we've definitely seen is our higher rate of module attach rate which obviously drives the size of the system sale as well. The 2400 has just been strong from announcement, but the products above that, the VIPRION products above that have also been strong again with the attach rate. Service provider obviously was a bit weaker last quarter but that is definitely the main area that we sell the high-end VIPRION and I think that's going to continue.","Andy Reinland","And then to the ARX question, its contribution to revenue was 5.8 million for the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Yeah, guys, a question around the product side. If you look at your guidance at the high end of the range of 370, assuming 30% year-on-year services growth which is what you've been doing here recently, implies about 5% product growth year-on-year. Can you talk about that and also how you see product sales doing through the year? You talked earlier about seeing product growth and if you can quantify that a little bit in terms of what you're thinking, are you talking about, something closer to your traditional kind of 50% to 20% range or something below that?","John McAdam","Yeah, but I'm not going to quantify it, Brian, but just to give you an answer. So first of all, remember we're talking about the refresh coming towards the end of the calendar year, that's the target. That clearly won't have a major impact on the first quarter. So that's one thing. Secondly, don't forget the seasonality issue. We don't want to be the only company out there that doesn't have seasonality. I wish we were, but we're not - we have seasonality in Q1, so that's taken into account. I feel personally very strongly that the product refresh that the DPI functionality that what we're doing with the ADF, the application delivery firewall, is going to drive product revenue. But given this environment we're in, we're not going to throw numbers out there. We're going to play a quarter a time at the moment.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Can you talk a little bit about VIPRION then, just give us an idea what that did in the quarter? Was it down sequentially along with telco and the [telco piece] [ph]?","Andy Reinland","We don't break out the mix when we talk about the results. I think we would say as we look at our high end generally over our low end, we saw it pretty consistent.","John McAdam","I mean the very fact that we talked about the VIPRION products over the year have been over 100% growth, the very fact we talked about the VIPRION 2400 being hot, that means there are some issues there that we need to fix at the appliance range, from a competitor perspective. And that's what the whole appliance refresh is all about. So we feel really good about our VIPRION trends and the way they're going to continue.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Subu Subrahmanyan with The Juda Group. Your line is open.","Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group","Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about the opportunity with Cisco discontinuing their ACE development, how you are factoring that into your thought process in the first quarter and through the year? And John you mentioned some security module sales numbers. Could you (inaudible) what those numbers were?","John McAdam","Okay. On the issue with Cisco in terms of their (inaudible) in the market, I think it will be very significant for us. And by the way I'm not alone in the room here, everybody feels that. We did a North America quarterly business review on Monday where we get to see the key management there and they're very excited about it. Let me pass it over to Dan. He can maybe give you some more details about \u2013 we are in a prime position here because a lot of these accounts tend to be larger accounts, they want to have a company that's very focused in this market with a great balance sheet and all that good stuff and that's really us. So I think you're going to hear us talking very, very favorably of that opportunity during the year.","Dan Matte","Subu, this is Dan. So we're pursuing that very aggressively out in the field all around me, going to all regions. We've already seen a number of face-to-face meetings take place. We've had just lots of interest around it. Cisco is doing roughly 200 million of run rate per year in ACE sales and plus they have a pretty significant installed base over the years starting with LocalDirector and all the products that they've had over time. So we've got some great incentives for customers and partners. So we have our channel involved in this as well.","And then also I think in the short term, it's important to know that the activities that Cisco has going together are purely of a reference in nature, so there's always challenges with the sales force alignment and compensation and how incented will those people be. So our challenge with Cisco over time has been getting invited to the party and if we do get invited, we do very, very well. And clearly there were people that were at the party and are asking us to participate. So we're as John said, very bullish on it.","John McAdam","Let me add one more other thing about this I think it's exciting for us as an opportunity, this isn't just about replacing that base, it's not just about that. This is about giving us a very significant opportunity to get into more Fortune 500 accounts and sell much more than the current base we've got because what we'll be replacing here is mostly load balancing type applications. We will then work with our other value-added stuff that we've got in TMOS; security, optimization in the software module. So I think it's a much bigger opportunity than just replacing that base. And as I say, I think you'll hear us talk into that in quarterly calls for this year.","Subu Subrahmanyan - The Juda Group","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Your line is open.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities","Just on the Cisco front, what is assumed in your outlook as you \u2013 in your guidance for the December quarter, are you assuming that you're closing much Cisco business or what kind of sales cycle is there associated with that?","John McAdam","Yeah, we do have opportunities in the pipeline already because of this opportunity. Some of these opportunities are close to commit range, but I wouldn't say it's markedly incremental in terms of what we are assuming for the guidance. As part of our normal way, we look at what's in the pipeline? What's the fact of the pipeline? And then there are some deals that are related to Cisco or not, are they all in that, I'm sure we'll know, because it's just happened, it's just happened. So I wouldn't think about it too much in relation to our guidance. It's not been that significant.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities","And how are you responding to Cisco with partnering with Citrix once they develop some integration with Cisco at their service products, how do you envision that you'll be able to address that?","John McAdam","Well, I don't think the integration of the products are doing, I think that's more in that definite space. We're going to use a tried and tested technique here in terms of competing with both Cisco and Citrix with win rates in their high 80s, low 90s which is better product, more focused, great customer satisfaction, best performance, most functionality, I feel pretty good about that.","Andy Reinland","Strong partnerships.","John McAdam","Strong partnerships.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities","Okay. Just a quick question then. Andrew, what did you say the gross margin guidance was for the \u2013 non-GAAP guidance was for fiscal '13?","Andy Reinland","Well, we said that GAAP was 83%. We didn't give non-GAAP but I think it will be consistent with, probably close to 84%.","Erik Suppiger - JMP Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Northland Securities. Your line is open.","Catharine Trebnick - Northland Securities","Thank you for taking my question. Could you say how many of the VIPRIONs that are installed have an attachment rate to virtualization? Is there any way we can tie some of that virtualization growth to your growth going forward?","Karl Triebes","This is Karl, Catharine. With the VIPRIONs, what's very popular is attaching vCMP which is virtualization for those platforms and that's been very popular. We have some very big customers, especially like in commerce and other areas, they are leveraging vCMP. So that's definitely \u2013 then of a really high trajectory with the platforms.","John McAdam","The other module that has been very significant with VIPRION has been ASM and APM security modules.","Catharine Trebnick - Northland Securities","Got it. And then one quick thing on Traffix and the release, are you planning to release this next version on TMOS in Q4? Did I miss that earlier in the call or you didn't say?","Karl Triebes","We didn't say but our plan is to release at the end of this quarter and then it will start rolling out in the field going into next quarter.","Catharine Trebnick - Northland Securities","And have you had any betas yet for the new DPI technology?","Karl Triebes","Yeah, we've been in beta for some time with all major features that are coming out\u2026","John McAdam","Yeah, whenever we come out with our significant release like this, beta is obviously one of the critical parts. So that's been going on for quite a while.","Catharine Trebnick - Northland Securities","All right. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Eric Ghernati - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Hi, this is Eric Ghernati for Tal. Sorry, this question has been asked a couple of times in different ways but I kind of want to clarify it a little bit. So assuming the refresh cycle, there's no refresh in the March quarter, do you \u2013 is there a reason to think that your product revenue would increase on a sequential basis or reverse the sequentially downtrend in Q1?","John McAdam","Well, first of all, I think I heard you saying we won\u2019t expect a refresh of the products in the March quarter?","Eric Ghernati - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","That's right, and I know late in the calendar year going into the March quarter?","John McAdam","Yeah. So in other words, if we complete a goal of having these products available at the end of this calendar year, we would absolutely expect that refresh to have an impact in the March quarter, absolutely.","Eric Ghernati - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, that's helpful. The other question that I had for you is with respect to \u2013 if that's the case, then given that the seasonality that's across some of our verticals like government and telcos and financials, all of which are typically down on a sequential basis, where do you think the impacts would be most pronounced? Is it technology and others or\u2026?","Andy Reinland","Yeah, I think it will be pretty broad based. I mean as we come out with this - the previous question was around DPI, obviously that's focused on the telco. I think with the new hardware platforms we're coming out with, that's going to give us great opportunity in more entry level, which will be more international geographies. I think it will be very broad based.","Eric Ghernati - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","So you think this could be even benefit telco in the seasonally slow Q1 \u2013 sorry, Q2?","John McAdam","Well, the one area that I see \u2013 we'll see on that. We have a fairly conservative view of telco for the December quarter and frankly we'll need to take a view as we move into January and we'll give you updates on that as to where we think that's going to be.","Eric Ghernati - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. One last question for me, the disclosure around the security software revenue, 55 million up 98% year-over-year, clearly a lot of that is incremental to your business. I'm sure you're going to hesitate put a firm number around it, but how should we think about the growth outlook for this particular piece of the business going into 2013?","John McAdam","Again, we wouldn't give you a specific. We will talk about it in more detail about security in November. We will do that. We thought it'd be a good idea actually to put some information on it and we're talking about ASM and APM security modules specifically and they obviously had a 90% growth. So we're not going to give you a specific, however do we think it\u2019s going to be a good growth driver? Absolutely. We don't see that momentum \u2013 we think that momentum will continue.","Eric Ghernati - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Can this \u2013 sorry, can the incremental \u2013 do you think the incremental sales from this product or revenue can get you close to your 2010 growth target that you already have?","John McAdam","Yeah, well, we're not commenting on that as we move into this year given the cautious environment we've been seeing. So we're going to do that quarter at a time.","Eric Ghernati - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Thank you. Guys, I wanted to talk about two things. First of all the security for the first time I think you've quantified $55 million and Andy correct me if I'm wrong, this is just ASM, APM just the module, not any service revenue attached to that. Am I correct?","Andy Reinland","Yes, exactly. Not only not service revenue but as John \u2013 yes, service revenue as John highlighted, but also nothing for our new application firewall, nothing on the hardware that's been driven. Those are just module sales.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Very good. And is the margin on this business in the upper 90s, is that the right way to think about this?","Andy Reinland","For the modules?","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Yes.","Andy Reinland","It's pure software, so it's software margins.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Software margins, okay. And regarding your telco business, it's been down now for three quarters in a row if I'm not mistaken and it sounds like from your commentary \u2013 I'm sorry, just two quarters in a row but quite substantially in each of those two quarters and it sounds like you're preparing for another down quarter in the December quarter. I'm having a hard time understanding why would that be the case, why is that business deteriorating so fast?","John McAdam","I don't think there's any sinister or any trend there. It's pure project oriented where we see the project, we see the rollout, the dates and that unfortunately gives you some lumpiness and I think you're going to see that next year as well.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Well, could it be then that your win rates within this vertical is deteriorating, how do you gauge your presence there?","John McAdam","Definitely not, that's not the case. Because of most of the telco deals that we're talking about, they have a significant effect in the quarter because most of them are VIPRIONs, we don't have any competition with VIPRIONs when we're doing this.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Okay. And regarding the transition into the March quarter of 2013, so clearly by the end of this calendar year, I would assume, or around your Investor Day, you're going to announce many of these new products that you're talking about through the call and I'm trying to get an understanding whether you think there is the possibility that that creates a pause in demand from you customers? Number one. And number two \u2013 and maybe that's one of the reasons your large deal flow has somewhat slowed or being delayed or not closing as quickly. And second \u2013 John, when you talk to customers, how much of a concern is there from the elections and the potential fiscal cliff in February? Could it be that this delay in business could last through actually the March timeframe? Why isn't that more of a logical assumption?","John McAdam","Well, that's an economy question and frankly will depend on the economy. I don't think it's impossible, but we'll see. I do think by the way that a lot of uncertainty when we talk about macro, we are including the election and other, but certainly when we talk to customers, we are hearing a degree of entrenchment, there's no question about that. When that was in a really bad scenario in 2009 we only saw that for a couple of quarters and then of course we saw pretty massive suppressed demand. But I really think that the tailwinds we've got going for us puts us in a really good relative position. ","In terms of are people waiting for the product, we have no significant anecdotal information on that at all. I mentioned (inaudible) we met with our sales force, we didn't hear that. I'm not saying it's impossible, there are probably some examples, but I don't think that's going to be a material effect on the actual quarter.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer","Very good. Good luck, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS. Your line is open.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Thank you. I just had a couple of questions. The first one, I think you characterized your expectations of revenues from Traffix being material in the next fiscal year. I was just wondering if you could help us just maybe bracket how you define materiality. Would it be at least 10% of your sales? And then I had a follow-up.","Andy Reinland","Yeah, we don't break it out like that. But material test mean it's going to have an impact on the top line numbers that allows us to increase investment and increase marketing efforts to expand that footprint. We're really looking at it now as an opportunity to grab footprint in that space and it's about getting out there and winning those fields. So that's our approach.","Karl Triebes","We also think by virtue of having that diameter footprint in data center, it really helps enable us with our DPI solution because that requires a tie-in directly to the diameter interface. And our upcoming release were a full diameter proxy which is built right into BIG-IP. So what it means now is we occupy this footprint, where we can do traffic steering, apply our intelligence to the traffic that's going through the carrier data centers, but also being able to communicate with other parts of it to our diameter routing.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, John, I think a lot of people asked you about Cisco ACE. I wanted to ask you a slightly different question. You've been integrating security in your appliances, we're now seeing some of the security vendors, whether that be Juniper or Citrix trying to move towards integrating \u2013 at Palo Alto are trying to move towards integrating load balancing functionality. I'm just curious, how do you kind of \u2013 what do you make of some of these gyrations in the marketplace? Are you seeing any impact yet or do you think it will be a while before any of the security vendors have any success integrating load balancers?","John McAdam","Yeah, I think that's going to be a long time. And frankly and this is what the load balancer can be so generic in meaning, what we have, remember, is a session-based full proxy that basically just doesn't do packet load balancing and so we can do it at incredible speeds and we have the applications fluency associated with that, so we don't see that. One of the things I said when I did my introduction was I mentioned application delivery firewall is going to have performance above the competitors. We are talking about very significant performance and I think that and the functionality of an application fluency in areas like that, but in fact (price) [ph] performance is going to be a major advantage for us.","Manny Rivelo","Amit, this is Manny. Let me just add something to it. And John highlighted here we have this whole proxy capability into our devices. When we orchestrated our technology whether it be hardware or software, it has a layer seven-full proxy which allows us to move through the protocol stack and add additional services in one pass-through router device of a session layer. That is significantly different than taking a traditional firewall and trying to apply layer seven intelligence to it. Putting a load balancer inside a firewall is a complicated issue. You always have to have the right platform from the foundation and what we've done is, we've built the right platform starting with some availability services and we've put security services in it, so we think we have a leadership position. The data will prove that out when we announce it later this year. And I think we're seeing some performance characteristics that are just \u2013 order to magnitude greater than anything in the market.","Amitabh Passi - UBS","Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","John Eldridge","Hey, Victor.","Operator","Yes, sir.","John Eldridge","We're going to take one more question and then we'll terminate the call.","Operator","Absolutely sir. Our next question comes from Ryan Hutchinson with Lazard. Your line is open.","Ryan Hutchinson - Lazard","Great, thanks. A clarification and then maybe a question for Karl. The clarification maybe just some color around the fourth quarter contribution from security. I obviously appreciate the insight, helps us look at the core business as well. And then the question is more on SDN, given there's been a lot of investor debate, there's obviously a potential for an architectural shift here to occur whereby you could write applications to a controller who's going to serve the same function that some of the physical appliances are playing in the network. Some argue that it could even go as far as load balancers, firewalls as we look out over five years. So one, Karl, I'd like to get your insight into, if you think that's even remotely possible? And two, if it is, how do you guys participate? Thanks.","Karl Triebes","That's a big question. We're going to spend a lot of time on this at the Investor Day. We're absolutely \u2013 we have SDN in the roadmap and we're doing a number of things with our partners to support that, but we'll get into a lot more detail in a couple weeks here on exactly what we're going to do.","John McAdam","On the security, Ryan, obviously we don't talk security numbers in the quarter; we're going to talk a lot about it in November. We mentioned the growth rate on the modules of ASM and APM, for example, and how significant that was and we expect that to continue. Still we didn't talk about the data center firewalls and we won projects in that as well, so I can't give you numbers here but it's pretty damn significant on a quarterly basis.","Manny Rivelo","Ryan, this is Manny. Let me just add one additional comment on SDN just so that you're aware and like Karl said, won't go in great detail but the one great thing about our platform is our platform has already a separation of data plane and control plane. Consequently it's very well suited to  play in the SDN environment. And what you'll see is as we enhance to support the SDN protocols whether it'd be VXLAN, NVGRE, and our and our open (flow) we\u2019ll stick in those SDN installations, if you will, and be able to provide services. So customers who are used to traditional F5 services will be able to carry those services forward in a hybrid environment and we\u2019ll go through it in a lot of detail.","Ryan Hutchinson - Lazard","All right. Thanks.","John Eldridge","Okay. Thank you all for joining us today and we hope to see you in New York at the Roosevelt Hotel on November 15. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

And I say that coming from Ciena, where the team's focus rivals F5 in terms of innovation and customer service. Beyond the company's core assets and its people, F5's core expertise in application services is a critical differentiator. With the speed at which this digital economy runs, the number of business-critical applications and the services they need will only increase.","This insatiable demand for more applications and more application services bodes very well for F5. Because we stand in front of more applications than any other company in the industry, we understand better than anyone how to make those applications perform and how to secure them.","In the near term, I intend to build on the foundation laid during John McAdam's tenure as CEO, and my immediate priority is maintaining our focus on the plans outlined in last November's Analyst and Investor Meeting. Those execution priorities are closely aligned with my own view of trends in customer demands and the opportunities ahead.","Specifically, we will continue to expand the breadth of application services, including security, that we offer our customers. And we will accelerate our efforts to make our solutions easily deployable in the combinations our customers choose: in the public cloud, private cloud, co-location facilities and our own cloud-based platform, Silverline, as well as in the data center.","I want to conclude by thanking the global F5 team, partners and customers for their incredibly warm welcome in my first month on board. And in the months to come, I look forward to connecting with F5's wider analyst and investor community, as well as reacquainting myself with those of you with whom I have worked in the past.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy for a review of our second quarter.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Fran\u00e7ois. With Fran\u00e7ois new to F5, my prepared remarks for Q2 are a bit expanded and will flow as follows. I will open with high-level comments on the quarterly results, next share a number of Q2 customer wins, followed by an update on products for Q2. Then, I will give more detail on revenue and other selected financial results, as is normal, and conclude with commentary on new products and functionality being introduced in Q3, combined with our Q3 outlook.","F5 delivered revenue of $518.2 million in fiscal Q2, reflecting year-over-year revenue growth of 7%. The majority of this growth came from sales strength in the U.S., highlighted by strong enterprise and service provider sales, offset by continued weakness in EMEA and lower-than-expected services revenue.","We were particularly pleased to see product revenue growth accelerate to 7% year-over-year in Q2, up from 2% year-over-year growth in the prior quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.43 per share for the quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.95.","During Q2, we had a number of large wins that helped drive product revenue growth and reflect our continuing focus on opportunities in security and the cloud. To cope with the explosive growth of traffic resulting from its unlimited data plans, a large U.S. service provider is deploying VIPRION Gi firewalls across mobile switching centers, which will support over 100 million subscribers nationwide. VIPRION's superior scalability and high-performance enable the customer to replace its existing firewalls on a smaller footprint at significantly lower cost.","As part of its Cloud Edge strategy, a top U.S. financial institution needed to provide secure access to third-party affiliates such as mortgage companies and credit card processors. Their decision to deploy VIPRION in an Equinix based co-location facility provided an extensible platform that can be used to lock their third-party affiliates to specific applications. The VIPRION solution also enables millisecond response times as they build and access applications in the cloud.","In EMEA, a large government agency launched a project that includes plans to go digital in every court and tribunal. This involves initially moving three key services and later expanding to 20 to the Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform. The agency has license virtual additions of LTM, AFM and ASM, allowing it to operating applications seamlessly between on-prem and the cloud ensuring the same level of security.","Closer to home, a large beverage retailer and a Silverline DDoS customer expanded its Silverline services with the new three-year contract that includes Silverline's WAF protection as well. Under the new contract, both the DDoS and WAF services will also be extended to the company's workloads in Azure.","These another major wins during the quarter, as well as significant opportunities in the pipeline continue to validate F5's ability to deliver products that meet the increasingly varied and complex needs of our customers, as they migrate towards hybrid infrastructures.","Contributing to stronger product revenue growth, the entire family of new iSeries appliances was available for the entire quarter. Customer response has been positive, and we continue to be happy with the uptick of the new platforms which was in line with prior appliance refresh cycles. We launched TMOS 13.0 during Q2, which includes a number of important new features. Among them, enhancements to enterprise and service provider protocols, including DNS, HTTP, and TCP and the addition of MQTT support, which is specific for IoT workloads.","We also introduced new security features and functions, including OAuth 2.0 identity support and improvements to Behavioral DDoS, bot detection and fingerprinting. Also included with the launch of the TMOS 13.0 is the new, high-performance 40-gig version of our Virtual Edition. In addition, we continue to see steady demand for a 100-gig VIPRION blade, which now includes availability of our vCMP functionality.","Other new security products introduced during the quarter include our new Herculon product family, which allows our sales force to sell DDoS Hybrid Defender and SSL Orchestrator in a stand-alone form factor or as solutions on BIG-IP. And, finally, we made our WAF solution available as a utility offering in the Microsoft Azure marketplace.","Switching gears to detailed results for the quarter. Product revenue of $241.1 million grew 7% year-over-year and represented 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $277.2 million also grew 7% year-over-year and accounted for 53% of total revenue.","Revenue from the Americas accounted for 56% of total revenue during the quarter, up 7% from the second quarter of 2016. EMEA contributed 24% of revenue, up 4% year-over-year. While APAC contributed 15% of revenue, reflecting year-over-year growth of 16%. And Japan, at 5%, was down slightly year-over-year.","Enterprise customers represented 65% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 22%. And government sales were 13%, including 4% of total sales from U.S. Federal.","In Q2, we had four greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which accounted 17.9% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which represented 16.3% of total revenue; Tech Data, formerly Avnet, representing 12.6%; and Arrow, contributing 10.5%.","Our GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 83%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.6%. GAAP operating expenses were $291.8 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $252.8 million. GAAP operating margin was 26.7%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.8%. And our GAAP effective tax rate for Q2 was 33.4%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 32%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $175.3 million. In Q2, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $138.16 for a total of $150 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion in cash and investments.","DSO at the end of Q2 was 51 days. Inventories were $32.5 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $9.6 million. Deferred revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $929.6 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,515 employees, an increase of 55 from the prior quarter.","Moving on to new products and outlook for Q3. In Q3, we will introduce new products and functionality that further extend our opportunities across on-prem, public cloud and private cloud architectures.","First, we will introduce our support for BIG-IP in the Google public cloud. We will also be releasing App Connector 1.0, which enables our customers to connect the public and private cloud application infrastructures, effectively extending their private cloud workloads into the public cloud.","In addition, we will launch a set of technologies that enable microservice environments, including our Container Connector, which orchestrates BIG-IPs with microservice environments; and a new Application Services Proxy, which links components within microservice environments. And we will release the next version of BIG-IQ, which further increases it's scalability and will provide our customers with enhanced visibility and analytics.","As we look to the back half of the year, we continue to foresee momentum from the business drivers we outlined at the beginning of the year. The continued adoption of our iSeries products, accelerating sales of software solutions and F5's growing relevance in cloud environments, all serve as a foundation for continued product revenue growth.","While, we are pleased with the uptick the products introduced in the first half of the year and excited about the opportunities the continuing influx of new products represent, we feel that the ongoing uncertainty in EMEA merits prudence as we approach our outlook for Q3.","With this in mind, our revenue target for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 is $520 million to $530 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be in the 83% range, including approximately $5.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84.5%. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $286 million to $296 million. This includes approximately $38.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","For Q3, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 34% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 32%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.47 to $1.50 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $2.01 to $2.04 per share. We plan to increase our head count by up to 60 employees in the current quarter. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $170 million.","We would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Participants, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Speakers, our first question will come from the line Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. And Fran\u00e7ois and Jason, good luck to you on your new roles. Andy, I guess, you're going to be the speaker for tonight. Maybe we can dive a little bit into what's going on in Europe and on the weakness that you're seeing there. First of all, is there a way for you to kind of quantify to us how much you missed over there? I'm just trying to gauge, if your report have been fine, where do you think you would have landed relative to your original guide?","And then, is there any color you can give about that weakness, whether it be enterprise, service provider, ADC, security, North Europe, South Europe, UK, FX-driven, competitive-driven, anything that you can give would be greatly appreciated?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, yeah. So two things I'd highlight there related to guide. I'd be reluctant to quantify, but EMEA combined with the shortfall that we saw on services, which \u2013 we had talked last quarter about services continuing to decline, but then through the year we'd see it shallow out and then start to grow again. It ended up dropping a little more than we anticipated, and that was us just misreading the tea leaves on some end-of-life products, so to get that out there.","Coming back to EMEA, the combination of those two, yeah, they would've had impact on the number we think. So that's why we're highlighting it, and it has our focus. And then, in terms of what we're seeing there, John, did you want to?","John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc.","Well, this is John DiLullo, so we have a very experienced team there. And I think they're doing well, but we're definitely seeing a few delays in a couple of areas. I think some of that is connected to some macro conditions. People are trying to understand exactly what it means, what Brexit means, from a data residency perspective and then, also, some of the new data protection regulations that are coming out. And I think that's pausing things for us and that's what's causing a bit of the delay there in order flow.","And we have a couple of execution problems too that we're working through. We've put some new leadership in the UK and in Germany. And we're doing a lot more to map the teams to some of the public cloud growth opportunities out there, and also doing a lot more training. But I think we're making progress.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Andy, just a follow-up on that. On your outlook, you've mentioned it conservative just given the issues that you're seeing. Can you give us a little bit more color about your working assumptions into Europe specifically for the next quarter, or are you assuming no improvement whatsoever in the region? How do we think about your level of conservatism with regards to that region?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I'm not sure conservatism is the word I'd use on this, because I think we've been talking with the sales organization, evaluating the pipeline, looking at the business. We've highlighted this for a number of quarters now. This really isn't a new dynamic for us. And I think taking it all in collectively, we looked at the picture that we thought we could expect from the business at this time and factored that into the guidance. And that's resulted in the guidance we gave you today.","Ittai Kidron - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Very good. Good luck, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jess Lubert of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And, Fran\u00e7ois, welcome to the team. Couple questions. Maybe just first, can you talk about linearity in the quarter, average deal sizes and the percentage of revenue from new appliances? And then, in past product cycles we've typically seen a fairly healthy acceleration in product growth in the quarters following the big initial launch. So I was hoping to understand if you think we'll see a similar trajectory in the second half of this year.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, Jess. And you might have to help me if I miss one of your questions, but I think you started with linearity. And actually, early in the quarter, we felt pretty good about our start in January. As we got through the first month, we felt pretty good about it and then started to see it taper off. It was similar to the prior quarter, in that middle month kind of pull back and then landed okay, I would put it.","And then, to your question on our product refresh. One thing we talk about a lot is the uptake in the product refresh, and I think at times we don't draw the conclusion we want you to draw when we make these comments, because we talk about \u2013 in the first full quarter, we want to see roughly 25% and we see that increasing over four quarters to 80%. And so, when does that really kick in for us is a driver?","And if we look back historically, really it's when we start to get into the higher percentages of the sales being represented by those new appliances that we really see the full driver. So we did feel we saw some good wins this quarter and it did impact the product revenue growth that we saw. But we think we're going to see that get through Q3 and start to build after that.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, average deal size, and I guess would love it if you could touch on just kind of how the public cloud is playing into the results you're seeing and what gives you confidence the public cloud can be an opportunity and isn't the cause of some of the weakness you're seeing here?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So on the average deal size; I think last quarter we were at right around $110,000. This quarter it moved up a little bit, $125,000. So one of the things that is giving us confidence is seeing the average deal size move up a little bit. But our $1 million plus size deals were actually pretty strong across the rest of the world. And when we evaluate our business, that's an important metric for that. And then, for cloud.","John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. On the public cloud, Jess. I think what we're seeing is that customers are at varying stages of their cloud adoption strategy, where when customers haven't made their decision on public cloud migrations or really their architectural decisions, and they're a little bit hesitant. That's not as good for us. When they have made their decisions and they are actually embarking on a cloud strategy, then we're seeing multiple catalysts for us. In fact, we've done some analysis around that. And we're seeing that those customers who have moved to the public cloud that were F5 customers before actually tend to spend more with us once they've made those moves.","So that's kind of a catalyst for us. Silverline is a catalyst for us as our own proposition in the cloud. So we're seeing sort of multiple catalysts emerge. But really, for us, it's really good when customers have made their architectural decision and they actually have moved to the cloud. That's when things accelerate for us.","Jess Lubert - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jeffrey Kvaal of Nomura Instinet. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet","Thank you very much. Fran\u00e7ois, let me add my voice to those congratulating you on the seat. I know that the people on Ciena certainly miss you. And, Jason, I am looking forward to working with you as well. Let me begin, maybe Andy, by digging into your commentary on the product refresh being in line with the prior one. The prior one was a little bit more diffused in terms of its timeliness, this is a little tighter. And yet the product revenue was still able to get up to about 20% growth year-over-year for a few quarters. Is that the kind of in-line that you were referencing, or if you could put some more color around that I'd appreciate it?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Specifically, my in-line was the uptick of the appliances in sales. So not necessarily the \u2013 I don't know that I can verify your 20%. I mean it definitely did, when it got to full steam, drive very solid revenue growth. And so, when we look at it internally, we look at the uptick and start to watch when it gets \u2013 we're in the second quarter, it's in line in terms of percent with what we've seen previously. Your comment's very fair, it was more elongated before. So we're trying to factor that in and then looking at how it's going to drive product. And as I said, we have our guidance and we think we'll see that really start to kick in as we exit Q3.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet","Okay. So would it be fair to say then it will be the June and September quarters where you should see the peak year-over-year of comparables, and that should be materially higher than where we are today?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Well, you have our guidance for June, right? So I'm going to let that stand as it is. Then, I think as we go into Q4, which is our calendar Q4, has its own dynamics. And I think we'll see it play in there. And then really as we expand out 18 months to 24 months and if you look historically, that's when we've seen it be a real strong driver.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet","Okay. And then, lastly, the gross margin. Obviously, very good. Again, are you seeing any reasons why that would drift up given the rising mix of software?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. We always talk about that as software becomes more prominent in our business, that naturally is going to carry up to gross margin. Historically, we've looked look at that as an opportunity to derive top line growth. Probably the most prominent example recently is investments in Silverline. And I think we'll continue to do that and balance that trade-off of investment against higher gross margin.","Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal - Nomura | Instinet","Thank you very much. Talk soon.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks. Okay.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is open.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. Fran\u00e7ois, I wanted to start with you and ask your initial thoughts. I know you haven't been in the seat long. But maybe if you could add some color and then any adjustments you see necessary to make here regarding areas of focus? I heard you mentioned security in your prepared remarks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yes. Thank you, Jayson. Well, sort of early observations. As I said it in my prepared remarks, really, really excited to be here. And I thought before joining and even more now that F5 has a very significant opportunity and has a big platform for growth, largely because of this insatiable demand for applications. And that sort of application networking talent here and understanding around what it takes to make applications perform better, go faster, be more secure, that talent and that understanding is unparalleled.","And so, really for us the focus and the things that I want to make sure we execute on is, making sure we remain in the critical path of applications wherever they are, private cloud, public cloud, data centers. And the company has already started executing on that. But there's a ton of things that we can do to even expand the number of applications that we support.","As an example of that, just yesterday we were meeting with one of our large Fortune 500 customers. They have over 4,000 applications, and we're only sitting and supporting a fraction of those applications. And as they move to both their private cloud and some public cloud implementation, we've got an opportunity to expand the number of applications that we support for that customer.","And so, I'm really excited about that opportunity. And then, the other access of potential growth for us is expanding the number of application services that we offer. Security is one of them. And we've already made a lot of headway in adding security capabilities to the ADC, but there are other things that we can do. And so, I see those two areas are important vectors for the company. And the priority right now is to make sure that we execute on these vectors.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you. And maybe a follow-up for Andy. You've mentioned $400 million run rate in software as an expectation exiting 2017, is there upside or downside to that or are right on track?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","I think we're right on track.","Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much. Given that the moving parts here \u2013 and, by the way, Fran\u00e7ois and Jason, both welcome as well. Let me extend that to you two. I imagine you'll hear this over and over again. But wanted to see if you could talk about the past historical seasonal patterns for the company, in that you've previously indicated operating margin in the second half of the year tend to move back towards the high-30% range versus sort of mid-30s in the first half of the year. Wondering if you're comfortable reiterating that perspective at this point, even if you're not guiding for the balance of the year on revenue?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I think specifically what we say, and this on the October call, is we gave general guidelines of guidance. And we have said pretty consistently over the last three or four years that we expect op margin with seasonality to pull back in Q1 and Q2, because it's important for us to not slow the machine down on our investing and head count to try to overly \u2013 I'll use the term overly manage op margin. And then, on strength of revenue see that increase in the back half. So I believe that plays out on revenue strength again. And you have our guidance, as I said, for Q3. And then, we'll give guidance for Q4 and see where that takes us.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. And then, in terms of a product trends, I'm looking for some indication of how to think about the Herculon family. I know it's new and you're just coming come into market. But what kind of expectations do you have in terms of contributions. And I think part of the thing I'm struggling with is, with security you're entering a market that's relatively mature with lots of competitors. And, historically, it's been difficult I think for F5 to sort of break out from the ADC market. And you certainly have had security features within your platforms, but now you have the security appliance. I'd like to see if you can help us level set, basically get a good expectation of how much contribution we should expect from specifically Herculon products maybe one year out? How should we think about that as a contribution? Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Simon. It's Fran\u00e7ois here. So you're correct, in that we have made some enhancements to the ADC platform that include a number of security offerings. If you look at our overall revenue growth, we had actually very strong growth, let's say, north of double-digit year-on-year growth in the security space overall in our portfolio in the second quarter. And that's primarily driven by security add-ons that we've put on top of the ADC platform.","The Herculon product is just out in the market now. It's really early days. So we don't expect it to have really meaningful contribution for several quarters. And you're right, it is effectively our first family of purpose-built platform for security. And so, there's an element of learning in the market that we're going through over the next few quarters. But we also believe that it addresses an important pain point and a growing pain point for a number of our customers.","So longer term, we actually think we have a very compelling proposition, and that there's going to be strong demand for the platform. It's really early days for us to quantify the contribution it will make to the business overall.","Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Good luck with it.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. You mentioned some challenges in Europe, ranging all the way from Brexit to regulations and all the type of things. Can you help us understand, is there going to be the need to change your go-to-market strategy, your sales force, realign things? Do you feel you got the right efforts in place? And is the majority of the shortfall in Europe under your control, or are you saying it's more regulatory Brexit uncertainty that's going on there? Thank you.","John D. DiLullo - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Jim, it's John DiLullo. So I think it's definitely under control and some of these macro issues feel more like pauses rather than systemic issues. The team that we have there is a very experienced team that was setting records just four, five quarters ago. So we think it's a temporary collection of macro elements that we need to work through.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then, the resolution time you think will be, when?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","So this is Fran\u00e7ois here. Well, on the macro issues, yeah, I think it's several months because, as you know, these macro issues, there's both issues around data residency and sort of regulation that's being passed in Europe. There has also been macro issues around the political environment. And as you know, we're going through, specifically in Continental Europe, a number of elections. And a number of large projects, frankly, have been delayed because the uncertainty surrounding these elections is probably greater than it's ever been in Continental Europe.","So that I think kind of works itself through as we get the results of these elections and the political uncertainty goes away. In terms of the things that we control which are more around the sort of realignment of our resources with the right opportunities, as John was saying, we have some things in motion already. But you probably know this and I know this with experience having spent a lot of time in Europe that these issues take a long time to fix, because they're not \u2013 moving resources in Europe isn't as simple and straightforward as it might be here in the United States.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","And this is Andy. Just one thing to add that we're not seeing \u2013 and I think it's important to highlight and was within John's comments was, the competitive landscape there for us hasn't changed. And obviously with the comments we're putting out here just around the theater, I mean we spend a lot of time talking with sales management making sure we understand what's going on. And the one area that we came away feeling good about is, competitively we feel as strong as ever.","And that's why John was highlighting that we saw deals pushing, not deals losing. And we think that's important to highlight. So we are readdressing everything from the structure, and how we're aligning resources and the view of the market coming through in our guidance, but I think that's worth highlighting on a positive note.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you so much for the details.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Just trying to get a sense here if we can kind of try to figure out what the extrapolation is with the guidance. And it kind of implies pretty much single-digit product revenue growth already so soon here with this product cycle. Does that mean we're going to actually potentially see you guys decline next year from a product revenue perspective or are we missing something?","And then, I just wanted to see if you could talk a little more about market share momentum and your confidence just given that Amazon, AWS, keeps taking share in pretty short order here. If that continues, how can you still grow longer term?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. Yeah. So I'll take the first part of that question, which is our view on growth and product. And, yes, if you back into our guidance with what we give you, that might look like it's pulling back a little bit. But, broadly, we think we're going to be pushing hard on the top line and we think we have every opportunity with the drivers we have in place. We're talking about the Shuttle series and a lot of the other products.","Our viewpoint is not that. I wouldn't comment on next year, up or down, but we believe we're a growth company. At our scale, what does that mean? We'll see. We provide guidance quarterly, but that's our number one priority to push the top line, and we're going to focus on execution and work to make that happen.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","And, Mark, as it relates to AWS, we're confident we can continue to grow over time and actually maintain or grow share. If you look at the dynamics in the marketplace, the overall ADC market is growing, the hardware ADC market is probably flat to down, whilst the virtual ADC market is growing fairly rapidly. Within the growth of the virtual ADC market, there are use cases that potentially are best addressed by a simple implementation with the AWS solution. So if a small enterprise has a single use case that doesn't require a lot of application services, but just simple load balancing, then that's a scenario where there's a good fit for a WAF-type solution.","But there are a large number of use cases in the virtual ADC space that are well addressed by our Virtual Edition, and we're seeing actually very significant revenue growth on our Virtual Edition and generally in software as a percentage of our revenues in general. So we're pretty confident that with what we've done and a number of the things we talked about today in terms of our road map, that we're going to continue to see growth in our Virtual Edition, included in a number of use cases in the public and private cloud. So we're pretty confident that we address a large number of use cases, and we can continue to grow.","Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc.","Take the next question, please.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of George Notter of Jefferies. Your line is open.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to ask a question to Fran\u00e7ois. Obviously, you're new to the company, you're taking a fresh look at the business. I guess, I'm wondering if there is any thoughts of looking at the capital allocation strategy of the company, any new views on M&A, anything you could talk to on that front would be great? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, George. And, hi. So let me start with capital allocation. Look, I think, I will start by saying that we see a great opportunity for F5 as a platform for growth and, therefore, we're going to manage the business for long-term growth. And as we do that, that may or may not require a change in how we allocate capital going forward. At this stage, it's too early to say whether that may or may not be the case. But for the short-term, there isn't going to be a change in our capital allocation model, that \u2013 I can say that definitively.","When it comes to M&A, George, as you know, I come from experience with an organization that has been quite acquisitive over the years. And from my experience, M&A actually can be very effective for growth in the technology space. And a number of these opportunities can help a company a lot, but they can also go very wrong under the right circumstances.","So, for me, it is going to be all about discipline in the case of M&A, really being disciplined about our build versus buy choices, really understanding why in some cases certain assets may be more valuable inside of F5 than outside of F5, and making sure that we have the right expertise in the company both to assess these opportunities and to make them successful if and when we pull the trigger on some acquisitions.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham. Your line is open.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Sneaking under the wire. So I was hoping we could get an angle on your expectation for Verizon's optical transport business in the core optical market for metro?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","No comment, Alex.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. So since we can't do that, and as an alternative, I was hoping you could give us a little bit more granularity on what your revenue expectations are for the growth rate in software-only and the growth rate in public cloud-only, as well as in security-only?","And if software is increasing as a percentage of sales, should we be expecting that to have a positive implication for the longer term gross margins, because I assume that that's a higher-margin product? Thanks.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I think, generally, we look at the broader trends that we're seeing across software security. Fran\u00e7ois highlighted that our security had strong growth year-over-year, continue to expect that from software. We're not going to guide it specifically, but the trends are there and we like what we're seeing. And as it relates to gross margin, we talked about it a little bit earlier. Yeah, it could push up gross margin. We're not guiding that. We talk a lot about reinvesting that back in the business, and we'll continue to evaluate that on a quarterly basis as we see the opportunity present itself to us. But, broadly, the trends are there going in the right direction, and we like where we sit.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Could you give us any more color on the rates of growth as opposed to, yes, it's nice. I mean, that's a pretty anemic way of describing the numbers relative to what you could provide?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Well, Alex, I think we can say that the three areas that you've mentioned, security, software\/virtual additions and public cloud, are all growing faster than our overall revenues. In this case of security, I did mention earlier that we saw very strong double-digit growth in the quarter. In the case of the public cloud, I think we've said before, it is actually growing even faster than security, but from a very small base to start with.","But I actually have some color for you, Alex, having been here just a few weeks. One of the areas of surprise for me was \u2013 a pleasant surprise \u2013 was to see how much we, as a company, are already doing in the public cloud on the various models, perpetual licenses, subscription, also the number of customers buying our Virtual Edition by the drink (47:44) as a utility, by the hour. And the number of hours we're billing in the public cloud is growing extremely rapidly.","So these are all areas of growth with \u2013 right now, some more meaningful than others. I'd say, probably of these three overall software, as you know, as a percentage of our business is pretty large. So that's a meaningful contribution. Public cloud isn't yet a meaningful contribution. And security is growing and kind of in between those two.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jason Willey - F5 Networks, Inc.","Robert, I think we'll take one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much. And, Francois, my congratulations to you as well. Andy, I was hoping you can expand on the weakness you saw in services. I was a little surprised to see it flat sequentially and, looking back, you guys have never had a flat sequential quarter in services before. And when we chatted at a conference in mid-February, I think you were still seeing at that point consistent attach rates and renewals. So maybe just give us a little more detail on what happened with the end-of-life products that you were referencing there and how we should think about that going forward?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. And actually the way to look at this is, we're modeling it is, sequentially it was basically flat, up $0.5 million. We think off of this new base we start to go to more normal growth rates again. And really the driver to that is, we did end of life a number of older boxes. I think they averaged over 7 years old and they did have strong attach rates to them, still renewal rates. The impact of it, frankly, I just \u2013 I missed the modeling on it and the impact was bigger than I anticipated. So that's where we ended up.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So maybe just to be clear on that because I think you've said before that you've got something like 40,000 units in the installed base that are over 5 years. So of these over 7-year-old end-of-life products, are there any additional ones that might stop maintenance in the coming quarters? And has that now been factored into the expectation that this is the bottom?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I don't think we're going to see anything in the short-term, and we'd advise you of that. I would highlight surrounding this discussion that our deferred revenue was pretty strong in the quarter. So we saw that go up 10%, and the majority of that is annual maintenance. So I would look at that too to balance the expectations. But as I said, when we started, we now think, off of this new base, it's a bit of reset, but we're going to start sequentially growing again at least in rough dollar basis consistent with what you've seen in the past.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just a quick one. I might have missed it. But did you say what percent software was as a percent of total revenue this quarter?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","No. We didn't break that out. No.","Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Simona.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yes.

The third quarter of fiscal 2014 was a quarter of solid revenue growth and profitability driven by strong uptake of our expanding array of systems and application services. In particular, demand for our security solutions was a key driver of product revenue growth and sales of our Good, Better, Best bundled solutions weighted heavily toward Best continued to grow ahead of our expectations.","Revenue in Q3 increased 5% from the prior quarter and 19% year-over-year to $440.3 million, above our guided range of $428 million to $438 million. GAAP EPS of $1.05 per share was above our guided range of $0.99 to $1.02 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.39 per share also exceeded our guided range of $1.33 to $1.36 per share. Product revenue of $236.9 million, grew 5% sequentially and 20% year-over-year and accounted for 54% of total revenue. Service revenue of $203.5 million increased 4% sequentially, 17% year-over-year and represented 46% of total revenue.","The Americas region accounted for 57% of total revenue during the quarter. EMEA contributed 23%, APAC 15% and Japan 5%. On a year-over-year basis, Americas revenue grew 17%, EMEA revenue 33% and APAC revenue 17%. Japan revenue was down 3% year-over-year. Enterprise customers represented 68% of total sales during the quarter, service providers accounted for 20% and government sales were 12%, including 3% from U.S. Federal. In Q3, we had three greater than 10% distributors, Ingram Micro, which represented 18.3% of total revenue, Westcon which accounted for 14.8% and Avnet, which accounted for 13.2%.","Our GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 82%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.2% GAAP operating expenses were $234.7 million, within our guided range of $228 million to $236 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $206 million. GAAP operating margin was 28.6%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 36.4%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 37.6%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 35.2%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Cash flow from operations was $138 million. After repurchasing approximately 1.45 million shares of our common stock for a total of $150.5 million, we ended the quarter with $1.12 billion in cash and investments. $481 million remains authorized under the share repurchase program. DSO at the end of Q3 was 50 days. Inventories were $23.1 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $5.5 million. Deferred revenue increased 19% year-over-year to $617.4 million. We ended the quarter with 3,745 employees, an increase of 110 from the prior quarter.","With continuing strength in sales of our security solutions and Good, Better, Best bundling options, momentum with Cisco ACE replacement opportunities and a general trend toward broader adoption of our full solution portfolio by large enterprises, service providers and government customers, we anticipate a strong close to our fiscal year. With that in mind, our revenue target for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 is $453 million to $463 million. GAAP gross margin is anticipated to remain in the 82% range, including approximately $3.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 83.5%. We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $232 million to $240 million. This includes approximately $23.5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.5 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","For Q4, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 38% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 35.5%. Our GAAP EPS target is $1.15 to $1.18 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.46 to $1.49 per share. We plan to increase our headcount by 125 to 150 employees in the current quarter. We estimate DSO will be in the 50 day range. We expect inventory levels within a range $23 million to $26 million and we believe our cash flow from operations will be at or around $150 million.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with our performance in Q3. Revenue growth from both services and products was very solid with strong sequential and year-over-year growth in both cases. I was particularly pleased with our year-over-year product revenue growth of 20%. From a sales perspective, the Americas, EMEA and APAC all recorded double-digit year-over-year sales bookings growth. However, sales in our Japan region was down versus last year due to a number of significant orders slipping into Q4.","Our services business delivered another solid quarter with 17% year-over-year revenue growth and once again added a healthy 19% increase to our deferred revenue balance, which now stands at $670 million. We continue to experience strong momentum with our Good, Better, Best sales motion in Q3, with customer adoption continuing to be very strong in the Best category, highlighting the successes we are seeing with our security solutions.","Q3 was our first two quarter-over-quarter comparison of sales of GBB bundles and I was really pleased to see sales of GBB bundles up 49% sequentially with 73% buying Best. Sales of GBB bundles now account for a very material percentage of our overall quarterly sales. Our security business continues to be our large growth driver with strong sales across the securities solutions portfolio including ASM, APM and AFM. We also started to win sales of our new Secure Web Gateway solution last quarter.","Cisco ACE replacement opportunities were another strong business driver last quarter. As we have seen in previous quarters, customers continue to take the opportunity to add functionality, for example, our ASM and\/or our AFM security modules when they implement the new F5 solutions. Also, our competitive win rate on these engagements is extremely high with win rates above 90%. In fact, we saw a rise in competitive win rates across the board last quarter as our sales force and partners leveraged our product technology leadership, our GBB pricing and our Synthesis architecture with the unmatched depth of our security and application optimization services functionality.","We closed the acquisition of Defense.Net last quarter. This acquisition increases our growing security solutions portfolio with cloud-based security services for protecting data centers and Internet applications from distributed denial of service, DDoS, attacks. Defense.Net's high-capacity cloud service is complementary to F5s existing on premise DDoS protection capabilities. The combination provides customers with the most comprehensive hybrid DDoS solution, engineered to absorb the full threat spectrum of DDoS attacks.","In the service provider market, we are seeing good traction with our integrated service provider solutions. For example, we are seeing project wins of our new policy enforcement module, PEM, to provide traffic steering and policy-based enforcement. Also we are making good progress with our GI firewall consolidation strategy and we believe this to be a very large opportunity in the service provider customer base. We continue to see new project wins to our Traffix Diameter solution, including a new Tier 1 service provider in Europe, which involved a new used case for Wi-Fi offload.","In Q3, we introduced hourly utility licenses on Amazon Web Services AWS. We now have two offerings inside of AWS. Customers can now deployed the F5 BIG-IP platform in the AWS cloud utilizing either their own license via Bring Your Own License or they can hourly licenses on AWS marketplace. Both models cover a wide spectrum of customer needs, allowing us to serve our current enterprise customer requests as well as the needs of new smaller customers. Both offerings have adopted our Good, Better, Best pricing models.","I am very excited about our technology direction and proposed deliverables on our product roadmap in the short, medium and longer term. Our product roadmap priorities align well with the trends in the main areas of our business focus. You will see F5 continue to introduce significant enhancements and world leading technology in our key areas of focus, security, service providers and mobility, the cloud and software defined data center architectures, F5 solutions as a service and management and orchestration.","We will be delivering another major revision of TMOS in the near future known internally as our Alpine release. The TMOS Alpine release includes approximately 124 new features with over 50 new features for security. Examples of new security functionality includes good integration of our Versafe module on BIG-IP for native deployment of WebSafe anti-fraud and detection services. Centralized management support for ASM and BIG-IQ, more GI firewall support for AFM, including significant new centralized management capabilities and BIG-IQ. Security to support extremely large customer deployments with larger rulesets and significant new DDoS capabilities, including over 100 vectors in hardware with new capabilities such as behavioral analysis.","Alpine will also include a new REST API for our ASM web application firewall. The REST API support for ASM allows operators such as enterprises and service provider to provision and scale vast services from the cloud. Alpine will also include significant features focused on our service provider market, including new message based traffic steering capabilities, allowing BIG-IP to natively steer and process SIP and Diameter traffic. Additional enhancements to our new policy enforcement module for fixed line use cases, as well as PEM and Traffix SDC integration. New carrier grade NAT features, including new iRules-based capabilities for additional programmability and flexibility and powerful enhancements to TCP optimization functionality giving service provider significant increases in functionality for optimizing their ever-growing traffic workload.","The Alpine release will also include significant features for SDDC and cloud architectures, including integrated support for Cisco ACI, VMware NSX SDN, Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager, and OpenStack plug-in for the Neutron (Load-Balancing-as-a-Service module. We are making great progress with our SDN partnerships and I believe that these partnerships will prove to be significant business drivers for us in 2015.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver to a sequential and year-over-year growth this quarter. The drivers of our business remain robust as we enter the final quarter of fiscal 2014. We experienced a very strong increase in our new business pipeline in Q3 up significantly from last year which should bode well for Q4 and fiscal 2015. Our Synthesis architecture for software defined application services provides F5 with the opportunity to play a very strategic role as customers continue to strive for competitive advantage and maximum agility by moving to new technology architectures. Also our portfolio of application products and cloud services continues to expand aggressively, which in turn expands our addressable market and increases the types of revenue streams available to our sales force and partner channel.","As Andy mentioned earlier, we are planning to invest for growth in the business moving forward. Our intentions are to continue hiring in Q4 with the target of 125 net adds to the F5 team. We will also be making infrastructure investments in additional data centers and security operation centers to ensure growth in our cloud-based opportunities, including Defense.Net, Versafe and general F5 as a service solutions. As I stated earlier, I believe F5 is in a really good position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter.","And with that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Ben Reitzes from Barclays. Your line is open.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Yes, hi. Could you talk a little bit about, as Cisco's rolling out ACI, what your go-to-market situation is like? And if you are seeing a pickup there in the pipeline of those related sales around ACE and whatnot? And then also if you could just comment on Federal and carrier verticals? What are the trends there? We have noticed Federal picking up with some folks. Thanks a lot.","John McAdam","Okay. Regarding the Cisco and ACI, and if I take -- this comment I am going to make actually apply to the VMware with NSX as well and with both those organizations we are deeply involved in integration at the product development level right now and we feel good with the progress in that. And we are actually starting to train our sales force in both solutions, but also on sales by sales territory scenario meeting up with our counterparts and making sure that our go-to-market is absolutely optimizing. Maybe Dave Feringa would want to comment more on it.","Dave Feringa","Yes, I would say across all three theaters worldwide, we are seeing great engagement with both Cisco and with VMware and a number of large opportunities. The one thing, I think, is really encouraging is it's happening organically. There is not a lot of push from the executive management for it to happen. The sales people themselves are seeing the opportunity to work together and we are seeing a lot of great longer momentum in that business and we think it is going to be great for us over the next year or so.","John McAdam","Yes, and on the vertical, first of all, Federal, I mean, it was typically a little bit lower from a revenue percentage this quarter. However, actually sales bookings were higher than that. So we feel reasonably good about Federal moving into the final quarter. We expect it to be pretty solid actually. We love the team there and it was actually a (inaudible) through the pipeline and the forecast and that feels quite strong. So we will see what happens there.","On telco, it's pretty similar. I mean, you are going to see that lumpiness. It was at 20% this quarter. It has been as high as 27%. We tend to look at it in the 20% to 25%. It is still very project oriented and the thing I did say on my prepared remarks were, we will start to see some nice progress with new solutions like the policy enforcement module linking in with the SDC Traffix solution there as well. And so, they are both, that and finance are really our strongest verticals moving forward.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","That's great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Brian Modoff from Deutsche Bank, your line is open.","John McAdam","Hello.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Can you hear me okay?","John McAdam","We just heard you there, Brian.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Okay, great. So anyway, in terms of the new product release, can you talk about what features are going to be the key to the customers in terms of what their demands are? And how do you expect that to affect hardware loading in demand on terms of people meaning to upgrade their boxes to accommodate some of these new features, particularly around the telcos? Thanks.","Karl Triebes","Sure. Hi, Brian. This is Karl. It's a big release, and it's pretty broad, and basically we are significant enhancements across the board for security, service provider, our cloud products or our core markets products. And so in terms of loading and the impact it might have in terms of customers and CPU, I think you are referring to that, as you turn on more functions you can use more system resources.","And so I don't know that the features would have that big of an impact. I think the packaging and with Good, Better, Best and how this is being taken to market probably has more of an impact, because the customers now are consuming a much greater number of our services across the board. So especially service provider, for example, we have introduced a lot capabilities around GI firewall to make that work better for them (inaudible) features there. So we would expect that to uptake, but the performance that we have in that product is still quite a bit off the charts.","Now PEM uses quite a bit of functionality in the platform. It does things like classification. It's enforcing policies. It's doing bandwidth limiting. It's doing a lot of traffic steering capabilities. So depending how that's leveraged, that can use a number resources as well and encourage people that use it to go for our bigger platform, like the eight slot VIPRION or the four slot larger one. So I think there is just a lot of opportunity there. We have introduced a lot of new enhancements to PEM. We are classifying over 750 protocols and applications, both web-based and non-web-based. And so it's quite a large set of capabilities and differentiated capabilities there.","John, is there is anything you want to add?","John McAdam","I will just add from my perspective, Brian. It's not quite answering the question, but the thing that excites me about the Alpine release, if you listen to some of the story that I did in the prepared remarks, is that we have really focused a lot of the functionality on the real growth drivers that we are seeing right now, like security, like Solutions as a Service, taking the Versafe acquisition and putting into TMOS as a module. We have a long history of that. It has been a very successful technique for us. We are certain we are doing well there. I think Manny, you can highlight.","Manny Rivelo","Yes. The only thing I would add, Brian, to that because you asked specifically about service providers and we are seeing it and this is predominantly -- we are seeing it across the globe, but the use case, I will talk about it, is predominantly right now in Asia where as we have enhanced the feature functionality for those service providers. They are actually telling us that based on the Internet traffic growth, because now we have strategic point of control in those service provider network that they want to see not only faster interfaces, but actually faster even boxes. Whether we cluster those boxes or we actually build faster boxes, they are absolutely right. As consume more services, the need is there for higher performance, both on the throughput level as well as the connection levels and really if the growth that's happening with mobile that's driving that innovation, if you will, in the service provider arena. So we are well positioned there.","Brian Modoff - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Mark Kelleher from D.A. Davidson, your line is open.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give some more detail on the geographic breakout. Japan, down 3%. You said orders were slipping. Is that a competitive situation. I know one of your competitors is strong there. Or is that a macro? And then to flip that, EMEA very strong, up 33%. What's driving that? Is that macro? Is that specific deals? Thanks.","John McAdam","Yes, I think that's a fair question regarding the competitive scenario. We don't have enough details on the actual -- what really happened in Japan apart from the fact we know that a few fairly large deals, and actually large, I mean, multimillion dollar type opportunities did slip. So that was the biggest reason. Having said that, A10 have done well competitively in Japan and we will what our win rate is there as we look in more detail.","But the main message is elsewhere. Our competitive win rate has gone up pretty significantly this quarter against everybody. In the Americas, we looked at on Monday and we saw a fairly material rise in percentage wins. So Japan, I don't know, but maybe they are the one outlier there, they do tend to focus, by the way, in Japan on lower end products. So we will see. But overall, we feel really good about competitive position.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson","And EMEA? Was that --","John McAdam","EMEA has been solid for us for a while now. We are making a lot of progress there. David, do you want to comment specifically on this?","Dave Feringa","I would say one thing, the EMA team has done a really good. They have been leaders with our security solutions for quite a while and they have really been driving it to our customers and I think that's been one of the reasons we have been driven up growth in EMEA at a really nice clip.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson","Okay. That's all I got. Thanks.","John McAdam","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Troy Jensen from Piper, your line is open.","Troy Jensen - Piper","Yes. Congrats on the nice quarter, gentlemen.","John McAdam","Thank you.","Troy Jensen - Piper","A quick one here for John. John, I know over the past year you talked about the number one company objective was accelerating product growth. You clearly achieved this. Bu the comps started to get harder from here. So just curious to know if there is any type of a product growth rate that you are targeting going forward? Or it's something we can benchmark into? And then I have a follow-up for Andy.","John McAdam","This is another one where I am smiling here. We knew we would be asked this question. We are very, very focused in product growth. Product growth is what makes the world go around and companies like ourselves, and we are very focused in doing that. We are not going to give any forward statements. We have given you -- you have got the guidance we have given for Q4 and you can make up your mind in that. We would say the pipeline, I did say the pipeline, we did a new business pipeline. It was very significant, the create rate last quarter it was. So that makes us feel good, but we are not going to give any actual numbers. Another indication, typically, of our confidence is our hiring and you can see that we want to go on a fairly aggressive hiring focus in the next quarter as well.","Troy Jensen - Piper","Perfect, and that goes into my follow-up here, maybe for Andy. Both of you guys have talked about investing for growth. So can you just about implications on operating margins? Do you expect to see much deterioration or modest what the spending there?","Andy Reinland","If you line up the guidance that we have, I think you will see that for Q4, we will see a little more strengthening in the op margin for the quarter. And next quarter, we will talk, on the October call, where we give guidance for the year, but what I would expect is for us to pretty much outline an operating margin year like we saw this year. But again, that's, if we are seeing the revenue growth, we are going to keep investing to drive the top line and that's going to be the focus.","Troy Jensen - Piper","All right. Understood. Good luck going forward, guys.","John McAdam","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Matt Robison from Wunderlich Securities, your line is open.","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities","I was wondering if you could help us understand, characterize the age of the installed base you are replacing these days? And maybe talk a little bit about the security market adjacencies that we can expect with Alpine or any other near-term product releases?","John McAdam","Right, and Matt, I don't know if it was on previous calls or in webcast, I have given information at certain point where we were on the installed base with installations greater than two years, three years, and five years and above. And these are significant numbers. I don't have them to hand right now. But what we will make a point of doing is next public event, we get a chance to do that, we will give out that information. The reason I am saying that is, there is still a long way to go on the product refresh. I know that. I just can't give you exact numbers in terms of the greater than three installed base because it tends to be pretty significant, something because there is redeployment that goes on as they do the refresh. But in terms of, do I feel that the product refresh capability is still a year or two years more, two years plus in it, I think it really has. What's going to drive that is extra functionality as well, but we will try and get that data at the next public event.","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities","Nice to hear you have got such visibility in what's left to do. What about the adjacencies?","John McAdam","Yes, I mentioned it's our biggest driver. We continue to add functionality to it in terms of the solution portfolio. DDoS, I think, is going to be very big for us with our differentiated hybrid solution of on-premise and now with Defense.Net, we think we got a great decision there. By the way within just over a week of the DDoS acquisition, we started to see orders coming in for we were actually approached.","So I don't want to get too carried away on this one, but we did see that at the beginning of it. We were actually balancing in fact how aggressively we bring that to market with the resources that Julian and his service team that are going to drive this, putting in place. But I think that's going to be good for next year.","And then you have things like what we are doing with GI firewall. There is whole load of what's going on in security, specifically.","Karl Triebes","This is Karl. I would jus add a couple of things. With integration of WebSafe from Versafe into BIG-IP, that simplifies our anti-fraud deployments and we actually have a mobile application as well, that we are in the process of integrating as part of that. So we will be able to address both traditional PC-based access as well as mobile as we go forward. That simplifies that. GI firewall, as John said, is big because we have massive scalability but we are also shortly releasing extensive new capabilities on our management platform that give us centralized management for both firewall as well as for our web application firewall. So now it makes it much easier for large service providers to off and deploy these services and there's native capabilities there. So those are just a few examples, as John said.","John McAdam","The other, I am not sure I would call it as adjacent, but I guess to some degree it's an adjacent scenario, but we really believe with the progress we are making with our SDN partnerships, that could be very, very profound, is a word I have used quite often about this in terms of being a growth driver going into next year as well.","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities","Is the outbound and application firewalls fitting there with any of the stuff?","Karl Triebes","For outbound, we have our access policy manager with our Secure Web Gateway integration as part of that. So that's a portion of that outbound used case if you look at. We are actually integrating identity as part of our firewall solutions. So we are actually using the identity components that we have in our access policy manager to allow security policy not just based on application, but user and endpoint as part of that and actually endpoint application as well. So that opens up additional use cases. We are not trying to go head-to-head, say, like with the traditional next-generation firewall from, say, like Palo Alto or somebody like that. It's more inbound user and application focused.","Matt Robison - Wunderlich Securities","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Ehud Gelblum from Citigroup, your line is open.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Hey, thanks, guys. I appreciate it. A couple of questions. First of all, I know you don't give the technology vertical anymore. You stopped doing that a few quarters ago. But if you were to isolate the Web 2.0 type players out there from the other service providers and the other types of customers, is there anything you can give us a sense as to kind of what their activity level is doing? Are they accelerating in line with what we are seeing out of your topline or stronger?","And then on Versafe, now that you have got a couple of NOCs up and running, it actually has real OpEx associated with it as opposed to some of your other product, where it has COGS but not sales, et cetera or OpEx, but there is actual real OpEx in operating the Versafe operation. I was wondering, is it breakeven yet and where do you expect it to, obviously, integrating it into Alpine should provide a huge boost for it? Where do expect it to go? So I am trying to get a sense as to where it is now, where do you expect it to go and if we can look at it from a profitability perspective with respect to its ongoing cost and the return on that, that would be helpful.","John McAdam","Yes, this is John, Ehud. Let me answer the Versafe and I will pass the vertical to Andy, although I will help on that before I do. On Versafe, absolutely we are investing in this right now. It's absolutely not at breakeven because we haven't unleashed Versafe yet to the sales force and frankly we will probably do that as we start the fiscal year at the sales conference. It will be a lot easier for us to do that when we have it integrated as a module in TMOS. Having said that, we have taken orders over the last couple quarters. We are building the customer base but we are at really early stages of increasing the investment in the SOCs and therefore obviously that is some OpEx. But I think something I think we are digesting and balancing well and I think it's going to be a nice growth driver for us.","Regarding the verticals and I will pass it to Andy, if he want to add more to it but we are not breaking out the technology. That means we don't want to talk about it. We believe it's very similar to enterprise and that's why threw it in there. Because we are talking about companies like large server companies as well as some of the dotcom companies we include that in the vertical. But what I will say is, that's still a strong part of our business and I don't see that changing.","Andy Reinland","And that's exactly what I was going to say. It continues to be a strong vertical for us. We just have chosen the tact of not getting into detail, especially because it's a smaller number of large companies, is the implications to that discussion and that really isn't the makeup of that vertical. It's much more broad than that. So we will stick to the enterprise level.","Karl Triebes","This is Karl again. I was going to say one other thing about Versafe. It's not only interesting with its core business, but the technologies involved in that, we are able to leverage these in other areas. So we are working on some new products for the future that will allow us to have much more advanced capabilities around things like, say, botnet detection. Being able to detect so far DDoS capabilities and do these things like that. Being able to detect things like malware. There is a lot of areas that this technology can take us. We are looking at these and how we might productized some of this as we go forward. We will talk more about this at our November conference.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Right. You will talk about it at our conference in September, too. But just to clarify, John, what you said, so it's not breaking even? Or it is breaking even?","John McAdam","Well, it has not breaking even yet.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Okay. That's what I thought where you were going with that. Okay. Thank you. So that's the reason, one of the reasons why that is weighing on OpEx or weighing on operating margin right now, why operating margin is in the 36%. Presumably without this, it could have been a point or so higher.","John McAdam","Well, we are not going to say that but the key thing if you look at in operating margin s the hiring we are doing. That has got the biggest effect.","Ehud Gelblum - Citigroup","Right. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","John McAdam","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Jeff Kvaal from Northland, your line is open.","Jeff Kvaal - Northland","Yes. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help us a little bit, talk about how far through the transition is the Good, Better, Best pricing structure that you are. Obviously it's been very successful in your first two-plus quarters out of the gate. It sounds like it's a material percentage of sales. Is this something that's going to be a tailwind for another two quarters? Another two years? How should we think about that?","John McAdam","We will see. As you say, you pointed out, it is two and half quarters, it's not even two and half quarters. Its just over two quarters and we feel really, really happy about the sequential increase this quarter. More importantly, we feel very, very happy about the sway towards the Best choice, which is way above what we modeled. But when we look at it by geography, and I guess this is no surprise, but the Americas is way in front in terms of the percentage that they do. So we would expect EMEA probably to catch up fairly quickly and then APAC and Japan to catch up as well. So that gives definitely, I think, gives us a headwind there. But the enthusiasm in the sales force is very good on this and the customer reaction is very good.","So I think it's going to be pretty good momentum, but we don't to day for how many quarters.","Andy Reinland","The other thing that I would add is that we saw our average order size increase again this quarter from 110,000 to 115,000. Still too early to pin that directly on Good, Better, Best alone. I think there's broader momentum in the business that's also adding to that, but still is an element to it.","Manny Rivelo","Yes, and the other thing I would add, Jeff, this is Manny, is although we are in this transition and it's becoming one of our primary selling motions from a licensing perspective, and I think that will increase to John and Andy's point, there is an after effect that we believe will also happen in that, is as customers try the new modules because we are with bundling those modules, they are beginning to deploy those modules, we should see additional footprint. So there is the other effect of more presence in these accounts in new places in the network that we classically have not been in and that's the result of having that functionality and extending that functionality using the software defined application services architecture. So hopefully it will be in the future for a long time.","Jeff Kvaal - Northland","I get it. So the idea, then, is they will be using more modules, and therefore they will require more capacity, and therefore the incremental sale will come there --","John McAdam","Well, also as they test out modules, they will buy more of them.","Jeff Kvaal - Northland","Okay. All right. Thank you, gentlemen, very much.","Operator","James Faucette from Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","James Faucette - Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. I just had a couple of quick questions related to your business with service providers. We have heard from a few other vendors that service provider has been weak, and just wondering if you have detected anything in that area. Or if particularly your new products are doing so much to mask that, that's hard to detect for you at all?","And then secondly, on the service provider opportunity, I think you have said in the past that Traffix alone might be worth as much as $100 million to $200 million. Just wondering if you still feel like that may be the case? And how you are thinking about the size of the service provider market overall?","John McAdam","Yes, and first of all, and we get asked this question a lot, when you get a bit of capital spend in service providers. I just don't think it has a significant material effect. We are still very project driven. We are very driven by traffic being money to own the network and going into the data center. We gain from introducing new technology like our GI firewall and like the PEM area. So that does mitigate that that type of spending was constrained, but I don't think that's a big issue for us. I think it's more project oriented.","Regarding Traffix, we have not given out any -- very, very specifically, we have not given out any guidance in terms of what we think the size of that can be. In fact, we have even been asked about the size of the market and you can look at various analyst reports and we don't even comment on that. We are more focused on finding project wins, finding use cases and just growing the business that way.","And the other thing about Traffic, just to remind you this is a much more complex sale for us and that includes revenue recognition. It's not just a matter of shipping the product and invoicing the customer and getting the money. It's all about milestones and consultants. So it's a longer sales campaign and a longer implementation campaign. But we are not giving out any numbers in terms of guidance.","James Faucette - Morgan Stanley","Thank you very much.","John Eldridge","Angie, this is John Eldridge. We are going to take two more questions and then end the conference.","Operator","Thank you. Rohit Chopra from Buckingham, your line is open.","Rohit Chopra - Buckingham","Yes, thanks. I just wanted to ask you a question on security, if you don't mind. Just want to come back to Secure Web Gateway and DDoS. John, these are highly competitive markets. They have embedded players. People have been there for years. How do you get material traction there without having an impact, for example, a negative impact on operating margin? If you could just maybe talk about the go-to-market there? And how do you make a bigger splash in that market?","John McAdam","Yes, let me start with DDoS. First of all, we have been very, very successful with DDoS ever since we introduced our AFM module, our general firewall module. In fact our drive into security, apart from the WAF we have had for years, our drive into the firewall space actually started with DDoS attacks, with the whole WikiLeaks business that went on, where a bunch of our customers were attacked regarding the WikiLeaks fiasco and we actually, in our iRules onto our ADC platform to protect them because the firewall couldn't cope with the volume.","So long story short, an ADC architecture is ideal for protecting against DDoS attacks. And as I say, our on-premise capability along with our roadmap where we have been putting DDoS protection vectors within FPGAs in the hardware because of the volume, very differentiated. So for us, now to have an off-premise solution is very synergistic. WE have already got a great reputation to be able to offer the hybrid capability. It is frankly an easy sale and was well accepted by the sales force. Although remember my remarks earlier, is that we are making sure we invest appropriately before we unleash the off-premise version on the sales force, but we have already seen orders for it.","Manny Rivelo","Yes, and this is Manny. I will just add maybe a little bit more context around each of them. First, starting with DDoS. There is no question that DDoS, as John says, is something we have been doing for a long, long time. And our on-prem footprint is what's led customers to ask us to be out in the cloud. So the cloud has really been customer driven because they want a hybrid solution to being able to do that. And what drives that is our success on prem, what's driving that is our performance capability on prem. The fact that we continue to do things at wire rate on prem, recall in the Alpine release, we will over 100 DDoS vectors, all done in hardware and then having a hybrid solution to differentiate solution in the market. Nobody really provides a hybrid solution today. They have a service on the cloud or service on prem, not truly a hybrid one.","And at Secure Web Gateway, it's a similar set of technologies. Performance is one leadership position we have. We feel very comfortable with the performance we have there relative to anything that's in the market. Obviously we are starting out with an on prem solution. That makes logical sense. By bundling it now as part of GBB, that gives us an advantage. Customers can now test that module and reduce their total cost of ownership while getting the performance benefits that they have out there.","And the other piece is more and more of the traffic, that's leaving the enterprise is encrypted. It's leaving out as HTTPS transactions encrypted and customers need high-performance decryption capabilities to be able to inspect that traffic for data loss prevention and things of that nature. So those are some of the value statements, if you will, from just a raw technology point of view that we bring to the table that lead to very promising conversations.","Rohit Chopra - Buckingham","Thanks, John. Thanks, Manny.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Mark Sue from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Gentlemen, as we conclude, I just have a question on just the pricing dynamics that we have changed. Intuitively, when we have \u00e0 la carte pricing that benefits the buyer and when we bundle and the deals gives you the advantage to the seller, now there's a bit of more for your money here with GBB. So the question is, what happens when customers have fully adopted the pricing change? What happens over the longer term? Are we actually front-loading some consumption?","John McAdam","First of all, I am not convinced on the statement you made, Mark, about bundling GBB. I think that actually benefits the buyer in a big way and the actual incentives we have given to make that happened are quite significant, which I think is why it has been so successful. I think the real thing, the real issue is, and we have to make sure we do this, the real issue is to make sure that the customers and the account managers make sure the customers realize the depth of functionality they have, use as much as possible and then that will increase that uses of the functionality. I think that's the real opportunity for us.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","So John, should we think of it as super-sizing and adding the fries and the Coke and the customers actually wait a little longer to come back? Or do they actually consume more?","John McAdam","They tend to consume more. The best example of this and its not really GBB, is the Cisco ACE opportunity, where I mean its being it has been fascinating for us to watch. The initial conversation is, can you place our load balancer. That quickly moves to, we have much more than that, and then that quickly moves to, oh, we are going to install your WAF, I am giving an example here. WAF is a firewall throughout the organization as we look at the whole portfolio.","Manny Rivelo","And Mark, it's Manny. Just a quick comment. This is not and obviously Dave Feringa can talk about this in great detail if we can when we get together in November, but a typical selling motion that can occur as a customer who comes in and I will talk about an ACE replacement who may come in and want to do like-for-like transaction, replace that ACE load balancer with that F5 load balancer because of the market leadership position we have. And once we explain to them the platform and the Delta in value that reside in that platform as it pertains to the additional services, it is not uncommon for me to hear the words, I am not sure where to start. And what that means is how many any issues or problems we can help alleviate for him. Obviously the place to start is just the replacement and to grow from that replacement as we move forward, but that is highly a very typical situation that we see out there and we are exposing with GBB is that additional value making it easy, taking the friction out of that and as a result of that hopefully, customers can realize that value going forward.","John McAdam","And the value includes not just extra functionality that we are talking about but it typically saves the money on their existing deployments in a big way. In other words, taking out 100 firewalls and replacing it by five of those. That type of thing.","Mark Sue - RBC Capital Markets","That's real helpful. Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. Good luck.","John McAdam","Thank you.","John Eldridge","Well, thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to another good quarter and we look forward to talking with you all again in a couple of months.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect from the audio portion."],"8369":["F5 Networks, Inc.

(Operator Instructions).","I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. John Eldridge, Director of Investor Relations.  Sir, you may begin.","John Eldridge","","Thank you, Angie, and welcome everyone to our conference call for the first quarter of 2013.  The speakers on today's call are John McAdam, President and Chief Executive Officer and Andy Reinland, Chief Financial Officer.  Other members of our exec team are also with us to answer questions following their prepared comments.  ","If you have questions following today's call, please direct them to me at 206-272-6571.

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements.  Factors that may affect our results are summarized in our quarterly release described in detail in our SEC filings.  ","Before we begin, I want to remind you that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.  Now I'll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","","Thank you, John.  ","Q1 marked a quarter of focused execution within a challenging macro-economic environment.  Against the backdrop of our typical fiscal Q1 seasonality, we delivered our 15th consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth reporting revenue and earnings results within our guided range.  ","Before I discuss specific results for the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter, I would like to remind you that non-GAAP numbers exclude stock-based compensation expense and amortization of purchased and tangible assets.  A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in our press release.  ","For the first quarter of fiscal 2013, revenue of $365.5 million was within our guided range of $363 to $370 million, an increase of 1% from the prior quarter and 13% year-over-year.  GAAP EPS of $0.88 per diluted share and non-GAAP EPS of $1.14 per diluted share were within our guided ranges.  ","Product revenue of $204.7 million grew 4% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue.  Service revenue of $160.7 million grew 28% year-over-year and accounted for 44%.  ","Q1 revenue from our Application Delivery Networking business was $359.9 million.  And revenue from our ARX File Virtualization business was $5.5 million.  Book-to-bill for the quarter was less than 1.  ","Accounting for 58% of the total, revenue from the Americas grew 12% from the first quarter of 2012.  EMEA, which represented 23% of revenue grew 22% from the first quarter of last year.  ","APEC accounted for 14% of revenue and grew 16% year-over-year.  Japan revenue declined 11% from a year ago and represented 5% of total revenue for the quarter.  ","Representing 23% of sales during the quarter, Telco was our strongest vertical followed by financial at 20%, technology 13%, and total government was 11% including U.S. Federal, which accounted for 5% of the total.  ","In Q1, we had three greater than 10% distributors, Avnet, which represented 16.9% of total revenue, Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.2%, and Wescon, which accounted for 11%.  ","Reflecting a record contribution from software sales, our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 83.3%.  Our non-GAAP gross margin was 84.4%.  ","GAAP operating expenses of $195.5 million were within our target range of $193.5 to $198.5 million.  Non-GAAP operating expenses were $171.7 million.  GAAP operating margin was 29.8%.  Our non-GAAP operating margin was 37.4%.  Our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 37.2%.  And our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 34.5%.  ","Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was $145 million contributing to total cash in investments of $1.29 billion at quarter end.  ESO at the end of Q1 was 51 days.  Inventories were $18.7 million.  Capital expenditures for the quarter were $7.8 million.  Deferred revenue increased 26% year-over-year to $480.6 million.  ","We ended the quarter with 3,125 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter.  ","In Q1, we repurchased approximately 555,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $90.02 per share for a total of $50 million.  Approximately $131 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program.  ","Now for the Q2 outlook.  At the end of Q1, we began shipping several of the new hardware and software products we will be announcing over the next several weeks.  We believe these new additions to our product portfolio will have a positive impact on our business as demand for the new products builds throughout fiscal year 2013.  ","In addition, we have continued to gain momentum with our security and service provider solutions.  And we anticipate continued solid growth from our services business.  As a result, we believe that we will achieve sequential revenue growth for the remainder of the fiscal year and reaccelerate product revenue growth in the second half of the year.  ","For the second quarter of fiscal 2013, our revenue target is $370 to $380 million.  We expect GAAP gross margin in the 83% range including approximately $3 million of stock based compensation expense and $1 million in amortization of purchased and tangible assets.  We anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $198 to $205 million.  This includes approximately $25.5 million of stock based compensation expense.  ","The recent extension of the R&D tax credit by Congress will have a favorable impact to our tax rates in Q2 driven by a one-time retroactive catch-up for fiscal 2012.  ","For Q2, we are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 32.5% and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31%.  We anticipate tax rates for the remainder of fiscal '13 to normalize closer to 36% for GAAP and 34% for non-GAAP.  ","Our GAAP EPS target is $0.93 to $0.96 per diluted share.  Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.21 to $1.24 per diluted share.  ","We plan to increase our head count by approximately 100 employees in the quarter.  ","We estimate DSO will be in the upper 40 day range.  ","We expect inventory levels within a range of $18 to $20 million. ","And we believe our cash flow from operations will be in excess of $95 million reflecting the large sequential increase in our federal tax payments that is normal in our fiscal second quarter.  ","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon everyone.  ","I was very pleased with the F5 team performance in Q1.  We delivered year-over-year growth of 30%, continued to strengthen our balance sheet with strong cash generation under an increase in deferred revenue.  And made significant progress in product development by introducing a range of new products with the goal of reaccelerating product revenue growth as well as increasing our solution portfolio in the addressable market for our products.  ","From a geographic perspective, we experienced mixed results in our major regions.  Business in the Americas region excluding U.S. Federal delivered solid sequential sales bookings growth over Q4.  However, we saw significant sequential decline in sales in U.S. Federal business.  The U.S. Federal sales in Q1 were below our normal seasonal trends and below our internal forecast.  We believe the reason for this decline was directly linked to the uncertainty caused by the Fiscal Cliff discussions.  The sales pipeline in our federal business remains very strong.  And we feel very confident about our future opportunities in this market.  ","Both EMEA and Asia-Pacific also delivered sequential sales bookings growth over Q4 with several large winds in each of these regions.  In Japan, we experienced a significant year-over-year sequential growth in sales bookings.  The booking forecast was reduced during the quarter as a well-publicized fiscal situation in Japan deteriorated.  Japan in particular still has a large percentage of sales fulfilled by the mid to lower end of our appliance range of products.  We believe Japan should benefit substantially from the product refresh I will talk about in a moment.  ","We had some really good sales in the last quarter when we replaced existing Cisco ACE products with F5 solutions including three ACE replacement winds in Fortune 50 companies.  Our percentage of new business in Q1 was up 6% to 46% last quarter driven by ACE replacement winds globally.  ","We set another record for software sales in the quarter.  Software module sales continued a strong growth.  And sales of our software only virtual edition products set a new record high with some $1 million orders in the quarter.  ","Once again, our security solutions produced strong year-over-year growth driven by continued strength in the security module sales especially with our application firewall ESM module.  ","We also made good progress with our diameter solutions from the traffic systems acquisition with some good comparative LPE project winds.  Service providers are moving to LP architectures on a global basis.  And we believe this trend gives F5 the opportunity to increase our strategic footprint with these operators.  ","We have come to expect stellar results in our services business.  And these results were again delivered in Q1 with 28% year-over-year growth and a 26% increase in deferred revenue compared to Q1 last year.  ","We talked in some detail at our analyst investor meeting in November of the large array of new products and software solutions, which we will be shipping during fiscal 2013.  Our development team made fantastic progress last quarter in meeting their development milestones to deliver a significant new release of TMOS referred to internally as Solar, as well as delivering a number of new ADC platforms.  The Solar release ships with approximately 76 new areas of functionality for TMOS including the debut of our advanced application delivery firewall solution.  Enhanced virtual solutions with the industry brought us high provider's support, deployment options to support physical, virtual, and hybrid environments, and a new service provider solutions that carry a great network address translation, and policy enforcement module with deep pocket inspections.  ","Our policy enforcement module allows bigger IT to inspect and classify application and protocol traffic and dynamically enforce service provider policies.  For example, our policy enforcement module supports a GX interface enabling inter-operability with a broad set of PCRX and our own traffic signaling delivery controller.  ","Development has also made great progress on the platform effect of delivering a range of new products.  You may recall that we started shipping the first of these new platforms last quarter when we announced the BIG-IP 4200v platform.  Our goal is to refresh the current product lines, a new range of products that provide significant price performance advantages with increased functionality.  We were very pleased with the initial demand for the 4200v in Q1, which was above our original forecast.  We believe this bodes well for the new range of products now available this quarter.  The additional new products now available include the new eight blade VIPRION 1400 chassis, which handles performance levels well above any other products in the industry.  ","Also introduced are the new VIPRION blades, our new FPGA hardware based security capabilities that significantly increase the performance of VIPRION to defend against specific types of the [inaudible] service or DDoS attacks while allowing the system to maintain an extremely high level of through put.  ","The new seas of the big IT platform introduces industry leading performance as well as first such as 10-gigabit interfaces on the low end and 40-gig interfaces on the high end of the lineup.  These new ADC platforms enable the dynamic use of IT resources through F5's innovative scale end technology.  ScaleN allows customers to elegantly enhance their application delivery infrastructures by adding capabilities as business needs grow.  Unlike comparative approaches, ScaleN does not require extra hardware or customers to disable features to use it.  This enables organizations to simplify their IT infrastructures and make their technology investments more efficient and cost effective.  ","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to see sequential growth this quarter.  As I mentioned earlier, we saw a very cautious spending environment last quarter especially in our Japan and U.S. Federal business.  However, looking forward, we believe that we have significant revenue growth opportunities starting this quarter.  And these opportunities should increase our momentum as we enter the second half of fiscal 2013.  ","We are now at the initial phase of one of the most significant product line refresh opportunities that we have had in several years.  Product training is underway and will continue over the next few weeks to ensure our sales force and channel partners maximize the advantage of these new products.  ","Also as mentioned earlier, we're seeing good momentum with sales of our software only and hybrid software system solutions.  We expect this momentum to continue with the expansion of our industry leading range of high provider's support.  These solutions can now support customer's bases and [inaudible] environments with unprecedented performance.  Our virtual software ADCs now include closed solutions based on Amazon web services and VMware vCloud suite as well as Microsoft Hyper-V, (NYSE:ZEN), and KVN Learning.  ","We also believe that the new solar release of TMOS significantly expands our addressable market.  In particular, the new application delivery firewall solution gives our enterprise and service provider customers the ability to integrate essential security capabilities and protect our application's data end users.  ","F5's application delivery firewall solution is the first in the industry to combine DDoS protection, network firewall, application security, access management, and DNS security with traffic management while maintaining industry leading performance and scalability.  ","We also see market expansion opportunities in the service provider market with our new Carrier-Grade NAT solution, policy enforcement modules, and our traffic systems to amateur solutions for LTE deployment.  ","In addition, TMOS has been engineered to operate in an SDN infrastructure dynamically enabling application level layer three to layer seven services.  TMOS provides true separation of data, control, application, and management planes enabling our customers smooth migration to SDN.  For example, with the introduction of new capabilities later this year to our big IP and our big IQ platforms, customers will be able to see mostly managed applications in both DX-1 and the NVGLE-enabled environments, and leverage sophisticated automation and application's control capabilities through our new iControl API extension Cloud IQ API.  ","Finally, we believe there's a real growth opportunity for F5 in replacing the large base of existing Cisco ACE solutions.  As I mentioned earlier, we had some great ACE replacement wins last quarter and the pipeline of business for this opportunity is very strong.  F5 has a unique and stellar track record of replacing Cisco ADC products in Fortune 500 accounts over the last several years.  The timing of our new ADC platform availability is ideal for us to exploit this opportunity.  ","Clearly, I feel very optimistic for the future prospects for F5.  I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the F5 team and our partners and look forward to continued support for the rest of the year.  And with that, we\u2019ll now hand the call over for Q&A.

","Brent Bracelin \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Thank you.  John, I really wanted to focus in on kind of the appliance refresh.  Could you kind of frame for us the volume, where the bulk of the volumes within the appliances are coming from, 4,200 was shipping in the quarter, is that the high volume product or how should we think about the two additional appliances that you\u2019ll be shipping this quarter, the 2,000 at the low end and the 10,000 at the high end?  Does that provide you move coverage as you think about the competition in that environment?  Are those important products that should give you a little more cover relative to the competitors and refreshing those appliances?  Any color there would be very helpful.  ","John McAdams \u2013 President, CEO","","The 4,200 PB is the lower end of the midrange, so not quite the \u2013 so you know, it\u2019s a [inaudible] product but it\u2019s not quite the volume product in either actual volume of units or in revenue.  It\u2019s a very important product, I don\u2019t want to put it down, it\u2019s pretty important.  The big volume product, certainly from a unit perspective, but also nontrivial from a revenue perspective is the entry-level product and that\u2019s \u2013 you know, that\u2019s been the case for many years and we think will continue.  So the truth falls in the series because we\u2019re talking about more than one model here, is very significant especially with things like 10 gig and [inaudible] like that.  ","","I can talk about, or maybe Karl could talk about if you want some more detail there.  And then of course there at the high end of appliance range, we\u2019ve set about even higher with the 10,200 which is \u2013 so, these are really important products, very significant ones.  ","Brent Bracelin \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","","Very helpful, and as you think about the competition, where do you think you need the coverage \u2013 is it really the low end where you felt a little pain, kind of, over the last, you know, six to nine months, and that\u2019s really the product that we should focus on going forward as a potential reacceleration growth?","John McAdams \u2013 President, CEO","","I think with a scale and technology \u2013 with the ability to do more modules, I, quite honestly, I think all of our products are going to be pretty hot because of that price, performance change.

You had three ACE wins in Fortune 50, did you recognize revenue on those, any of those three ACE wins in the quarter, are those wins that you do expect to see revenue on in the March time frame?","John McAdams \u2013 President, CEO","","It\u2019s actually yes and yes to most of that \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say 100% certain because it\u2019s - the forecast needs to be careful with forecasting accounts. But we saw revenue last quarter, and given the opportunity, we\u2019ll probably see that increasing in that \u2013 that\u2019s the whole point of getting into the Fortune 50 accounts, or Fortune 500 for that matter.","Brent Bracelin \u2013 Pacific Crest Securities","Okay, fair enough, thank you.

So, in truth, most of that solar stuff is this quarter \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s this quarter and beyond, and we would expect to see sales of that. I mean, it\u2019s very new, it will take a while to ramp up, take some training, as all software does.  We \u2013 oh, by the way, we expect the platforms in sales to be much [inaudible] because they can run not in just solar, but also in previous releases like the 4200 could, and the VIPRION 2400.  But with software, you know, we want to be a little bit cautious with because it does take some time to bleed through the market, but we would expect to see sales win.","Karl Triebes \u2013 EVP, Product Development, CTO","","Yes \u2013 and by the way, Matt, this is Karl.  One thing that I would also mention with the [inaudible] module, the customers tend to have a longer sense of \u2013 search providers tend to have a much longer qualification cycle where they have to go through and run the different applications, and whatnot in their environments.  So, the ramp rate of that will tend to be different than necessarily some of our other features like security, and other things in our platforms.  ","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","If it\u2019s probably solar, than it comes with maintenance agreements I would expect, right?","","John McAdams \u2013 President, CEO","","Absolutely.","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","So, is there any specific hardware that needs to be in place to invoke the policy enforcement \u2013 the DPI capability that is required for that?","Karl Triebes \u2013 EVP, Product Development and CTO","Yes, with the PenModual, obviously our VIPRION platforms and our higher end platforms \u2013 right now, we don\u2019t support it on the low end of the range yet, because it is very much focused on the surge provider market.","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","Yes, so the VIPRION platforms that are available now can do it?","Karl Triebes \u2013 EVP, Product Development and CTO","","That is correct.","Matt Robison \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","And update on DevCentral users?","Dan Matte \u2013 EVP, Marketing and Business Development","","Yes, sure, Matt, this is Dan.

A quick question on WesCon, as they are now 10% customer, were they \u2013 can you give us a sense geographically, was that mainly a US account, or were they more international, and was the growth there responsible for most of the uptick in services, or was that just coincidental?","Andy Reinland \u2013 EVO, CFO","","Hey, Ehud, the first part of your question \u2013 so, WesCon has long been a distributor of ours just to not hit that 10% threshold.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","Right.","Andy Reinland \u2013 EVP, CFO","","And then six months ago you might have recalled a press release where we named them really our first true international distributor, and so the balance of that revenue has \u2013 I don\u2019t have the specific breakdown, but it has gone over that 10% principle driven by international revenue, and I didn\u2019t hear the second half of his question.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","","Well, basically it was following up on that \u2013 as they peak through the 10% mark from where they were before, and I don\u2019t \u2013 we always knew there was significant\u2026","Andy Reinland \u2013 EVP, CFO","","Yes.","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","","But obviously they were in the 7-8% maybe range or so.

With guidance, we booked a bill less than one, how should we be reading the product versus services split as we look at guidance for next quarter?  Should we be looking for product revenue in sequential basis until again we can be sort of flat to perhaps downing \u2013 down a little bit with services making most of the difference given the book to bill, or should we be seeing products starting to move up on a sequential basis?","Andy Reinland \u2013 EVP, CFO","","Yes, when we give our guidance we always assume book to bill equal to one, so I think you can look at our guidance from that perspective, and the strong message I want to reiterate here though is we really expect to see as we go into the back half of this year, Q3, Q4, that is where we\u2019re really going to look to see reacceleration of the product revenue growth.  ","Ehud Gelblum - Morgan Stanley","Alright, okay, finally, on Japan, is \u2013 what\u2019s your expectation on Japan for next quarter \u2013 you said most of the issues were in the low end, I would imagine there\u2019s some competitive issues there.  Is that now shipping and fixed to the point where you can start seeing that to start to rebound, is that an area that we can look if we don\u2019t have much faith in the US Federal in the near term, is Japan an area that can start recovering sooner more in Q \u2013 in the next quarter, or the quarter after?

Jess Lubert from Wells Fargo Security, your line is open.","Jess Lubert - Well Fargo Security","","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions. First I was hoping you could help us understand what drove the weakness in the Technology Vertical, the business has declined year-over-year and four of the last five quarters, so I\u2019d be curious to understand.  Are customers waiting for new product? Is there a competitive issue? And to what extent you believe this Vertical is likely to improve in future quarters?","Dan Matte \u2013 EVP, Marketing and Business Development","","Sure Jess, this is Dan. So, on the Tech Vertical issue, you\u2019re right. I mean, the Tech Vertical has trended down over the past several quarters for us, and we believe it\u2019s driven really by a couple of our larger customers that are taking alternative architectural approaches in terms of how they\u2019re building things. So, generally what (dead air) and they\u2019re building some basic functionality into that app. And, so we\u2019ve been seeing that going on, and obviously we\u2019re doing something about it.  ","We\u2019ve got projects going on internally that we believe will provide this type of customer with bays that will make it easier for them to integrate our functionality into the applications [inaudible] that they\u2019ve got. ","John McAdam \u2013 President and CEO","","And just to be very pointed [Inaudible]competitive at all. It\u2019s more that you know they\u2019ve definitely seeing some architectural in-house changes.","Jess Lubert - Well Fargo Security","So, does that business kind of linger around this level the next couple of quarters, until you can implement some of these new solutions, then it ramps back up?  Is that the right way to think about it?","John McAdam \u2013 President and CEO","Yes, that\u2019s probably the assumption we\u2019re making at the moment.","Jess Lubert - Well Fargo Security"," And, you know, then they just want to touch base on the Carrier business, how you\u2019re thinking about that going into 2013, clearly a better quarter here. Several major Q1 providers have suggested they\u2019re going to spend more in 2013 than they did in 2012, so would love to get some of your thoughts, and what you\u2019re hearing from some of the major service providers. If you\u2019ve seen a change of tone, or an uptick in activity that has you more optimistic about the Carrier businesses as we work through the year?","Manny Riveldo \u2013 EVP, Security and Strategic Solutions","Hey, Jess, this is Manny, just to comment on that. So, we\u2019re actually seeing a lot of excitement based on the solutions that we\u2019re bringing out to the market. And it\u2019s primarily driven by a couple of factors.  As we all know, there\u2019s huge amounts of demand today around the mobile space.  So we\u2019ve been organizing and orchestrating over the course of the last year, is really a set of solutions for a mobile and fixed operators, that really begin to deliver advanced capabilities in terms of traffic management, and being able to send to the subscribers as what the application is.  And then being able to make policy decisions around that. ","So, as we take these architectures out to these customers, they\u2019re very interested in various different solutions.  So, we think we\u2019re going to have a very strong second half.  But to the point that Karl make, a lot of this new technology we introduced in the market \u2013 or we\u2019re introducing over the coming couple of weeks, is going to go into trial environments and it\u2019s going to have to go through validation. And this will be our PAM Module, our [inaudible] Modules, our advance traffic shaping, and traffic steering capabilities, as well as continuing with our Traffix Solution set to our Diameter solutions [inaudible] market.","Jess Lubert - Well Fargo Security","Would you expect the Telco business to grow faster than the Enterprise business in fiscal 2013?","John McAdam \u2013 President and CEO","Possibly, and we\u2019ve had this question so many times over the last couple of years. I think you\u2019ll see quarters where it\u2019s more lumpy than others. And if it\u2019s lumpy on the high side, clearly you know, we\u2019ll see it pick up a little bit. And certainly it\u2019s a key [inaudible] we\u2019ve got.  You know, when we look at the products we\u2019re bringing to market, especially in the software side of things with the application firewall and with RAM and with Carrier grade NAT, and Diameter, there\u2019s more of an array of products, but there is going to be some lumpiness.  So, I think over time yes, but I would like to talk about that in the next two or three quarters.","Andy Reinland \u2013EVP and CFO","","Yes, one additional comment Jess. We\u2019re going to be at Barcelona obviously a mobile well congress, and really rolling out these solution sets broadly.  And around three key tenets:  One is optimization of the carriers networks.  The second is really around the modernization, so they can monetize additional service offerings, and the third is around security.  Security is becoming a very, very important topic for all of the mobile operators out there.

So that\u2019s part of the equation that we look at as part of this.","Mark Sue \u2013 RBC Capital Markets"," ","Got it. And then generally on security, it seems when I look at your competitors, Cisco and Juniper, the security market share seems to have stabilized.

This is Manny.  Let me just take that, so in general no, it\u2019s not getting incrementally harder. Obviously the competition is aggressive, and as we enter the market they\u2019re going to continue to target not only themselves, but also us.  But what we\u2019re seeing is, we\u2019re seeing a new set of buying patterns are developing. And there\u2019s three predominant use cases that we\u2019re positioning our solutions to, and this is the solution that John talked about around out application delivery firewall.","The three use cases are mobile and fixed operators, and that is really all about performance and massive expansion, and throughput connections per second, things of that nature which our platforms are well suited to accommodate.","The second is really what I would refer to as the Enterprise and service provider, IT or internet data center. This is the protection of your dub, dub, dub applications and being able to defend those from [inaudible] attacks all the way to application vulnerabilities.","And the third thing we\u2019re seeing, which is really why we\u2019ve expanded so aggressively with our virtual addition, is being able to protect applications as you spin them out to the cloud.

We still saw that trend last quarter, so in in fact to be more specific, we actually saw 500 to a million dollar deals up quite significantly. But the million dollar plus ones [inaudible] to similar levels to Q4 and Q3, so we\u2019re not dismissing that macro, because we definitely believe that is a macro scenario.

So it sounds like you experienced Federal weakness in the quarter just [inaudible], the quarter you\u2019re guiding, the slight revenue you\u2019re guiding for, is that continuing Federal, underline Federal caution or are you adding to that from the Enterprise weakness?  So I guess there\u2019s a little bit of a question burred in that.  And then as you look to this recovery late in the year, can you talk to us about what the main driver there is?  It sounds like you think maybe the Telecom business is the primary driver for that road of recovery.  And if you could quantify where you get to on growth rate as well, you know, do you get back to like a mid-teens type of growth rate by the end of the year?  You know, any help you can give us there would be good.  ","John McAdam \u2013 President, CEO","","My apologizes for starting off negative, but on the final bit, we\u2019re not going to give the growth to you ever.  We\u2019re going to take that a quarter at a time.  We do think, as Andy said, we believe that in the second half total revenue growth will excel but that\u2019s the best that we\u2019re saying there, Rod.  ","On the forecast, yeah, we\u2019re being cautious in Japan and Federal.  I think we have to be there.  In terms of the Teleco as being the most exciting \u2013 it\u2019s certainly up there.  It\u2019s very, very exciting, Manny talked about that, the wide range of portfolio now that we can sell into these Telco\u2019s that are pretty unique in the whole mode of areas.  But you know, the ACE opportunity is massive for us.  We think the product refresh, if it follows any historical trends what so ever, will be significant as well.  And then the rest of the [inaudible].  So there\u2019s a bunch of stuff, you know, most of which, by the way, helps Telco, but also helps [inaudible].  ","Rod Hall \u2013 JP Morgan","John, it kind of sounds like you guys are \u2013 regardless of what happened in the macro, you\u2019re kind of positioned to grow in the second half of the year is the way you feel.  Is that the right way to think about it?  ","John McAdam \u2013 President, CEO","","From a product revenue growth acceleration perspective? ","Rod Hall \u2013 JP Morgan","Right. ","John McAdam \u2013 President, CEO","","Yes, that\u2019s correct.  That\u2019s how we feel. ","Rod Hall \u2013 JP Morgan","Yeah.  And then I just \u2013 one last little thing is all.  On SDN, you know, you\u2019ve made some comments about how you\u2019re positioned well to be integrated in the SDN.  It does feel like, though, strategically you\u2019re moving to providing [inaudible] services, the wider array of them.  But if you\u2019re not in control of the market you potentially are out of strategic disadvantage.  I just wondered, you know, you guys are pretty good in software, would you ever consider moving into that controller market? ","Karl Triebes \u2013 EVP, Product Development, CTO","","Well, our goal.  Hi, this is Karl, by the way.  With SDN, I mean, the big IP platform is inheritably designed to enable SDN environments.  And we\u2019re not trying to move into the switching business with that.  What that means for us is that we work with an eco-system of partners that allows our customers to implement these broad SDN-enabled applications and networks.  So we\u2019re partnered with \u2013 you know, we talked about at VM World, we demonstrated with VM Ware a service orchestration solution per V Cloud.  We have open-flow partnerships.  There was a press release that went out with, I think it was Big Switch that released a press release that talked about our interoperability with them.  Our platform is designed to work with these different application, these different control protocols and provide that application knowledge and really help optimize, manage, secure, do whatever, but focus on the applications as well.  ","Rod Hall \u2013 JP Morgan","Good.  Okay.  Thanks a lot, guys. ","Operator","","Thank you.  Simon Leopold from Raymond James, your line is open.  ","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","Great. Thank you very much.  I wanted to follow up on a couple things that were touched on earlier.  One is in terms of \u2013 I\u2019d like to get a better understanding of the Telco vertical use cases.  Let me share my understanding of how they\u2019ve been used is largely in the Telco data center, historically, and not really in the network and I think you\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about opportunities and applications in the network.  Could we get really a better understanding of the timeline of your expectations of let\u2019s say greater network participation in the Telco vertical?  ","Manny Rivelo \u2013 EVP, Security and Strategic Solutions","","Yeah, so obviously, this is Manny, Simon.  So obviously, the data center space is something that you mentioned you\u2019re familiar with so I won\u2019t go into that, but obviously there\u2019s a litany of solutions inside the data center space that we provide.  In the core network where our primary use case is, is really in [inaudible] core, sitting inside the [inaudible] core, analysing the traffic flow and being able to understand the application, the subscriber traffic flow.  And based on that, be able to apply a set of network services to monetize if you will or to optimize that.  ","So let me give you an example of that.  A typical example of that would be to understand who the subscriber is, what application they\u2019re trying to access.  If that application tends to be a video application, we may re-steer that traffic to a cacheting engine as an example.  Or if it\u2019s a non-premium customer, we may rate limit that traffics so that they don\u2019t consume all the RAM bandwidth.  At the same time, depending on what the flows are, we may want to provide security services or carrier-grade NAT services.  So what we\u2019re doing is, by understanding the application of the subscriber, we\u2019re able to implement a set of services inside that infrastructure, consolidating that, reducing the cost to the operator at the same time giving them monetization strategies.  ","In addition to that, we\u2019re moving very aggressively into the LTE space and we\u2019re looking at the growth in 4G networks and how 4G networks also integrate with 3G networks and roaming across 4G networks.  So the result of that, our Traffix acquisition that happened now approximately a year ago is something that we\u2019re aggressively pursuing with all of the mobile operators as we move out there.  So that footprint is also active, very active right now and we\u2019ve seen some material wins over the last couple of quarters so we\u2019ll continue to engage in that.  ","So those are two predominate uses cases above and beyond the traditional, if you will, data center solutions that we offer.  ","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","And have any of these use cases that you just described contributed to revenue yet or are they still on the come? ","Manny Rivelo \u2013 EVP, Security and Strategic Solutions","","No, they are.  They\u2019re attributing to revenue and as a matter of fact, a lot of the new modules we\u2019ve introduced over the course of the \u2013 or we\u2019re introducing here in the next couple of week, were being implemented in our platforms through iRules, right, because we have an open data plane and we allow our customers to program to that.  ","So the net of it is that we\u2019ve been monetizing this through the classic platform for numerous years.  Now that we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re exposing that through our [inaudible], making it easier for the operators to manage this environment, which is really what they\u2019re looking for.  They\u2019re looking for visibility and exposure and monitoring capabilities to be exposed natively in the product without it having to be programed if you will.  ","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","Great.  That\u2019s helpful.  And then the second thing I wanted to ask about was, you talked about wins from displacement of ACE products.  I\u2019m just wondering two aspects of that.  One is if you could characterize your win rate given that your competitors are also trying to exploit the same opportunity and displace ACE?  And the second part of that is have you had to sacrifice any margin or pricing as incentives for those trade ins, whether there was any kind of trade off for those wins?  Thank you. ","John McAdams \u2013 President, CEO","","Dan might want to comment on this as well, but we said \u2013 as I say, I mentioned we saw it through the North America \u2013 I keep saying that \u2013 the Americas.  I don\u2019t want to forget Canada and Latin America.  The Americas [inaudible] on Monday and we have the better wins and I didn\u2019t hear any losses.  You know, you\u2019re going to not win deals you don\u2019t see, that happens.  But the win rate seems to be incredibly high. ","Dan Matte \u2013 EVP, Marketing and Business Development","No, we\u2019re doing very, very well in the win rate and you know, we certainly have given incentives to our partners and certainly trade ins to the customers on, you know, to give, you know, bring the business in quicker and sooner to work.  We\u2019re not seeing any real losses to our competitors in the [inaudible] at this time. ","Manny Rivelo \u2013 EVP, Seucrity and Strategic Solutions","","And if I may add something, and this is Manny again.  We\u2019re not only seeing direct replacement if you will for server load balancing around ACE, but what we\u2019re also seeing is a very rapidly evolving landscape around threats and vulnerabilities that are out there.  So some of these decisions that customers are making are not just to replace the ACE functionality but they\u2019re to bring new functionality into that environment, like IPv6, like protection for DDOS attacks, things that we natively do also in our platforms.  So it\u2019s not just an apples-for-apples replacement, it\u2019s really upleveling their infrastructure and positioning for the future.  ","Simon Leopold \u2013 Raymond James","","Great.  Thanks for taking my questions.  ","John Eldridge \u2013 Director, IR","","Angie, this is John Eldridge.  We\u2019re going to take two more questions and then wrap it up.  ","Operator","","Thank you.  Kent Schofield from Goldman Sachs, your line is open.  ","Kent Schofield \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great.  Thank you.  To follow up on a couple of questions around software, you mentioned adding some performance features to the virtual additions.  Can you talk a little bit about what those are and what those mean for your software business going forward?  And then as a follow on as well to an earlier one, you mentioned some alternative approaches in the tech space.  How does that software play of yours fit into hopefully addressing those alternative approaches? ","Karl Triebes \u2013 EVP, Productc Development and CTO","","Right, so hey, Kent, this is Karl.  So with the VEs, we significantly enhanced performance so now we have 3-gigabyte versions pretty much straight across all the different hypervisor types where they can allow that.  So that enabled customers now in the virtual environments to run it three times faster than previously.  And then with regards to \u2013 you\u2019re referring to these customers that presume to Dan\u2019s comments earlier about some of these environments where they\u2019ve changed the architecture, well, in those environments, what they\u2019ve done is they\u2019ve gone and started leveraging some newer technology around Java Script and some technology called Node.  What they\u2019re doing there was essentially with their own development teams, kind of writing their applications to inherently understand or be a part of that framework.  With our newer \u2013 some of the newer functionality coming out in the big IPs, and this is just kind of a sampling of it, we have some new APIs, these rest- based APIs, both with our new big IQ management platform. Also, we have a next-generation version of iControl that\u2019s a part of the big IP project itself that allows it to inherently adapt better to these different Java Script or these Node or these other type of web-based environments more easily than in the past.  So they can automate, manage, orchestrate their applications much easier there.  ","So \u2013 and there\u2019s a lot more behind that in terms of our road map of what we\u2019re putting down with that, you know, we have some new stuff that for the cloud-based orchestration and et cetera.  But we think we have a significant offering coming that, again, helps us in these different environments.  ","Kent Schofield \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Great.  Thank you for the detail there. ","Operator","","Thank you.  Our last question comes from Toa Leone from Merrill Lynch.  Your line is open.  ","Toa Leone \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Hey.  Thanks, guys.  Just a quick question on the risk of \u2013 the risk in launching the products.  When Cisco launched or refreshed their switches, all of their switches at the same time, they [inaudible], people bought the upgraded low-end instead of buying the high end.  I\u2019ve seen the same thing with similar companies, similar launches.  What\u2019s the risk that you see or what are you doing to mitigate the risk that when you launch so many new products together, people downgrade to a lower product, but upgraded? ","John McAdam \u2013 President, CEO","","Yeah, and remember, we\u2019ve done this before, Toa.  Obviously, I don\u2019t want to sound complacent about the risk because you always have to look at that type of thing.  However, our platform is fairly unique in its ability to add more and more services, typically through software modules and we\u2019ve seen from the field, a [inaudible] for the ability to do more software modules at the entry level, more capabilities with DCMP, the [inaudible] multiprocessing where we can build more and more added value to the platforms and that tends to go way far and above the cannibalization effect.  We feel pretty confident \u2013 when we look at the 4,200 sales we\u2019ve had [inaudible], that\u2019s the way it will go.  There\u2019s more \u2013 much more [inaudible] in the terms of cannibalization.  ","Toa Leone \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay.  Thank you.  ","John Eldridge -  Director, IR","All right, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to talking with you all again in a couple of months from now.  "],"8726":["F5 Networks, Inc.

Factors that may affect our results are summarized in our quarterly release and described in our detail on our SEC filings. Please note that F5 has no duty to update any information presented in this call.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andy Reinland.","Andy Reinland","Thank you, John. In the context of our Q1 seasonality, F5 achieved solid revenue results in line with our expectations. Revenue of $489.5 million was at the top of our guided range of $480 million to $490 million, up 6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015.","As a result of both disciplined operational management and the benefit from the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit, we achieved GAAP EPS of $1.28 per share, well above our guidance of $1.13 to $1.16; and non-GAAP EPS of $1.73 per share, also well above our guidance of $1.58 to $1.61.","Product revenue of $234.7 million in the first quarter was down 2.6% year-over-year and accounted for 48% of total revenue. Service revenue of $254.8 million grew 14.9% year over year and represented 52% of total revenue. Accounting for 55% of the total, revenue from the Americas was up 3.8% from the first quarter of fiscal 2015.","EMEA, which represented 26% of revenue, grew 9.3% from the first quarter of last year. APAC accounted for 15% of revenue and grew 7.5% year over year. And Japan revenue, representing 5% of total, grew 4.3% from a year ago.","Sales to enterprise customers represented 62% of total sales during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 23% and government sales were 14%, including 5% of total sales from U.S. federal. In Q1, we had four greater than 10% distributors: Westcon, which represented 19.7% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 14.6%; Avnet, representing 13.9%; and Arrow, which accounted for 11%.","Our GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 82.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 83.9%. GAAP operating expenses of $272.9 million were within our target range of $268 million to $277 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $238.3 million. GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.3%.","Reflecting the one-time benefit from the retroactive reinstatement of the Federal R&D tax credit, our GAAP effective tax rate for Q1 was 32.1%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 30.6%.","Turning to the balance sheet, cash flow from operations was a record $203.9 million. In Q1, we repurchased just under 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $105.94 for a total of $200 million, ending the quarter with approximately $1.175 billion in cash and investments.","DSO at the end of Q1 was 51 days. Inventories were $33.6 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.3 million. Deferred revenue increased 23% year over year to $837.5 million. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,275 employees, an increase of 95 from the prior quarter.","Moving on to our Q2 outlook, with an increasingly uncertain macro-environment, we believe it is prudent to take a conservative approach to our outlook for the current quarter. Our revenue target for the second quarter is $480 million to $490 million.","GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be at or around 82.5% including approximately $4 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be at or around 84%.","For Q2, we anticipate GAAP operating expenses in the range of $272 million to $281 million including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We are forecasting a GAAP effective tax rate of 36.5% and the non-GAAP effective tax rate of 34%.","Our GAAP EPS target is $1.13 to $1.16 per share. Our non-GAAP EPS target is $1.61 to $1.64 per share.","We plan to increase our headcount by at least 50 employees in the current quarter. And we believe our cash flow from operations will be greater than $125 million reflecting the impact of two federal tax payments that we normally incur during our fiscal second quarter. We remain confident in the competitive strength of our product portfolio, our expanding footprint in security and our strategic position for the emerging cloud opportunity.","We expect that these factors combined with improving sales execution, our upcoming new product introductions and platform refreshes will enable us to re-accelerate our top-line growth in the back-half of fiscal 2016 and beyond.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I was very pleased with the F5 team\u2019s performance in our first quarter of fiscal 2016. We delivered year-over-year revenue growth of 6% with strong profitability and operating margins resulting in an all-time high cash flow from operations above $200 million.","From a sales perspective EMEA, Japan and our Asia-Pacific region all delivered year over year sales bookings growth. EMEA and Asia both delivered record-high sales bookings. Sales bookings in our Americas region were down year over year in Q1, as we experienced delays in closing several forecasted transactions in the U.S., especially towards the end of the quarter. However, I was pleased to see that sales transactions above $1 million remain solid in the Americas during the quarter.","Our services business continues to deliver strong results and excellent profitability along with a healthy sequential 7% increase in deferred revenue. Overall, deferred revenue grew 23% year over year in the quarter, which should bode well for future business. Our Good, Better, Best pricing models continues to be a significant percentage of our overall product revenues.","Customer adoption of the Best category remains very strong and in Q1 we continue to see year-over-year growth in sales across all regions with the highest GBB growth coming from our EMEA and the APAC customers. I was also encouraged by our software revenue in the quarter. We continue to see more than one-third of product revenue coming from software sales driven by security module sales, GBB and software-only VE solutions.","We had several wins in the quarter where customers are deploying our APM security module to ensure access security for their applications that have migrated into the public cloud environments. With the option to bring your own license or rent utility licenses by the hour, we offer flexible application services in the public clouds to some of our largest existing enterprise customers as well as new smaller companies who have never used F5 before.","Security continues to be the key growth driver of our business. Million-dollar-plus security deals grew year over year in size and volume in Q1 with EMEA delivering a record quarter in security sales. Deal volume for Silverline our cloud-based subscription DDOS and WAF security services was up by double digits quarter over quarter and new bookings were up significantly year over year.","We\u2019re also starting to see business opportunities for Silverline services across all global regions with wins in EMEA and APAC this quarter. Our Silverline cloud-based subscription is clearly in the early stages of adoption and the revenue numbers are still relatively modest. However, we believe there are real growth opportunities for Silverline subscription services. And we will continue to invest in this opportunity by adding inside sales resources and offering more solutions to the Silverline portfolio.","The security team continues to innovate and add significant malware detection capabilities to protect against threats like remote access Trojans, cross-site scripting attacks and phishing attacks. In Q1, we had some good wins with our WebSafe product, including two notable marquee wins in the banking vertical. Our clientless solution continues to interest enterprise security buyers, and recent attacks such as the pervasive Dyre malware phishing scheme has received much attention.","We detect and inoculate against this type of threat without declining customers to deploy client-based applications, and without requiring them to modify their existing applications. As a result, a much lower cost and faster time to benefit.","Cisco ACE replacements continue to be an important source of product revenue in the quarter with some large million-dollar-plus wins. The program also continues to boost our channel with over a quarter of the deals driven by our partners in Q1.","As far as the outlook is concerned, Andy indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $480 million to $490 million this quarter. In the context of several global macro-economic issues, we delivered solid financial results in Q1. But as we stated last quarter, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious in the short-term.","As I analyzed our business and growth prospects, I have absolute confidence in our strategy to meet the current and future demands of the market. We are focused on expanding our core ADC and cloud solutions to increase the size of our market in the areas like SSL inspection as well as capturing hybrid and public cloud opportunities.","In security, we will extend our focus on areas like the Gi Firewall application protection, and identity and access management. We will continue to grow and expand our Silverline platform and subscription revenue. We will increase our vertical focus in the service provider market and drive repeatability with our Gi Firewall, Gi run services, NFV solutions, and take advantage of our scalability and performance leadership with products like the new 100-gig blade edition to the VIPRION chassis.","We will continue to improve customer experience by delivering comprehensive management solutions with our BIG-IQ management and orchestration platform. We will leverage our strong partner ecosystem with leading vendors such as Cisco, HP, Microsoft and VMware, and areas like SDN as well as OpenStack environments.","Finally, we will leverage our global services organizations to drive product revenue sales while delivering world-class profitability and world-class customer satisfaction.","We have no shortage of business drivers for the second-half of fiscal 2016. Our road-map includes several new additions to our system and appliance range of products as well as significant software deliverables designed to increase our addressable market. We have the following deliverables currently targeted for next quarter.","We have a new high performance FIPS appliance based in the BIG-IP 10000 series appliances. It uses next generation technology, enabling an eight times improvement in the SSL performance of existing solutions. This product is designed to address core requirements in the financial services market. We are targeting the release of a new high performance 100-gig blade for the high-end VIPRION series platforms next quarter. This new VIPRION includes a 100-gig interfaces and more than doubles the performance of the existing cards to enable the first-ever terabit class ADC in the market.","The new blade runs all TMOS modules and is targeted at system providers, applications including Gi Firewall, Carrier-Grade NAT and intelligent traffic steering. We have already seen strong interest from the tier 1 service providers for the 100-gig product. And we are currently testing in tier 1 customer environments.","We will be delivering F5\u2019s next generation iRules called iRulesLX. iRulesLX allows for users to leverage node.js libraries to provide new functionality addressing the needs of the DevOps market as well as customer applications that need customization and programmability. iRulesLX is based in the LineRate technology and is now fully integrated into TMOS.","We also plan to introduce iAppsLX which allows for easy programming of specific use-cases for application services, leveraging the broadly used web application programming language JavaScript. iAppsLX also significantly enhances the F5 orchestration and SDN products, as it allows these use-cases to be dynamically published via BIG-IQ and to the various SDN controllers such as Cisco APIC, VMware NSX and OpenStack. This is a really unique feature, which should give F5 a clear advantage with our SDN partners.","We plan to release our web application firewall in Azure this quarter - sorry, next quarter. This will be available as part of the Azure service catalog and leverages iAppsLX to significantly simplify WAF services management in the Azure public cloud.","We plan to release 5.0 of BIG-IQ next quarter. We have already made significant improvements in the scalability of BIG-IQ in terms of managing hundreds of thousands of users. Release 5 now includes centralized management for all security products including APM, ASM, AFM, Gi Firewall and WebSafe Anti-Fraud. It adds new device management capabilities, ADC management and application analytics.","Starting next quarter, we plan to extend our product portfolio by adding purpose-built security products which will address new markets. The initial releases will include an SSL Intercept and an SSL Air Gap solution, followed by a standalone DDoS solution with new behavioral and threat intelligence capabilities in Q4.","In addition to the product deliverables I have discussed for Q3, we have the following product deliverables targeted for Q4.","A comprehensive appliance refresh will start this summer, replacing all current appliances before the end of the calendar year. The new appliances known internally as the Shuttle [ph] series significantly improve price-performance and will include our FPGA based architecture, allowing for all software modules including vCMP to run across the entire product lineup.","Furthermore, during fiscal year 2017, we will enhance the Shuttle series to offer new hybrid capabilities and hardware that allow for seamless connectivity between the datacenter, private cloud and the various F5 supported public clouds. We are also working hard to release a 40-gig capable version of our software VE solution to support NFV applications for service providers and high-end enterprises. We plan to show a demo of this at Mobile World Congress in February, with the production release at the end of the fiscal year.","We partnered very closely with Intel in this development and showed an early version last year at the Intel Developer Forum. I continue to believe that F5 is in a really strong position to take advantage of industry trends and customer requirements. Our hybrid application services strategy resonates well with existing and prospective customers. Our hybrid application services strategy was reinforced by a recent survey we did of over 3,000 global customers.","10 or more application services are used by well over half of the respondents, who recognize that slow unresponsive and unsecured applications can have a substantial negative impact in their business. In addition, the vast majority of these respondents indicated the plan to implement hybrid cloud architectures in the future, which clearly endorses the F5 hybrid cloud strategy.","This strategy is in place and our focus is on execution of the strategy with an absolute priority in delivering product revenue growth. I summarized several business drivers which will be available in the second-half of fiscal 2016 and we have every intention of taking advantage of these business growth drivers.","In conclusion, I\u2019d like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners, and the customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we\u2019ll hand the call over for Q&A. We\u2019re ready for Q&A.","John Eldridge","Sam, Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Oh, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","John McAdam","Hello.","Operator","Our first question is from James of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. I had two quick questions. First, when you talk about an acceleration in growth that you\u2019re anticipating for the second-half of the year as particularly new products start to roll out et cetera, are you anticipating that that will be evident on the total revenue line or are we talking about just a reacceleration in the product revenue?","And then, on the most recent quarter, we saw a significant uptick in services and deferred revenue. I\u2019m wondering if you can give us a little bit more color as to what that may be attributable to. Is this security products, Silverline virtual editions or something else? Thank you very much.","John McAdam","Okay. This is John in the first one. Then I\u2019ll hand over to Julian to talk about services. No, our absolute focus is on product revenue growth. But by definition that will grow the overall revenue. I mean, you\u2019ve seen the success we have in the service business with the deferred revenue. So we feel really good with that and the visibility of that revenue moving forward and Julian can again comment on that.","It\u2019s all about product revenue growth and clearly these business drivers. We\u2019re absolutely very, very focused in delivering them, and so that we\u2019ll get our product revenue growth, and then will give us total top-line growth.","Julian Eames","And then on the services side, the growth is purely in maintenance services revenue and in professional services consulting revenue, which has grown across the globe, mainly as we\u2019ve expanded working with partners. Pieces like Silverline and subscription are not included in that services number at all.","John McAdam","And one other thing, Julian, you might want to comment, I was impressed by the QBR, was that on the consultancy how much we\u2019re doing remotely.","Julian Eames","Indeed, if you look back over the last 18 months, we - gross margins for services has improved as we\u2019ve improved the delivery of consulting through remote delivery, which is around 60% of all the consulting we now deliver.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much.","John McAdam","Thank you.","Julian Eames","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Simona with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Simona Jankowski","Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the guidance, which was a little bit conservative. Was that just you are reacting to some of the macro headlines and what\u2019s seen in the markets here? Or is that in response to any actual slowdown in purchasing behavior from your customers? And maybe, you can just comment on any potential influence you think you might see in this quarter as a result of the upcoming product introductions. In other words, might there be a slowdown as customers are waiting for the new products?","John McAdam","Yes, so on the first question, I mean, obviously, we\u2019re looking at macro and we did take account of that, no question. We did see and I said in my script, we saw some slowdown on forecasted deals that happened towards the end - especially in Americas towards the end of the quarter. And we took that to some degree into account.","So it\u2019s a combination of all of the above. And we had the whole of sales management. John DiLullo had his team over and we had meetings, significant meetings last week. And we did our usual thing. We think we\u2019re being cautious. We hope we\u2019re being cautious. And yes, we did take the macro into account.","Simona Jankowski","And did you discern any difference in demand by vertical in terms of your end-demand verticals?","John McAdam","Not really. If you look at the verticals, the split of verticals, it was pretty similar to what we normally see. And it was pretty similar to in terms of performance within the geographies as well, so not really.","And then, you asked the question as well, sorry, about the new products coming. Obviously, you check that and that\u2019s something we\u2019ll look at. I don\u2019t think - we\u2019ve taken that into account. We don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see that. We have seen a big interest in the 100-gig product from the service provider. But having said that, we feel it was reasonably a good pipeline of existing business in the service provider pipeline anyway.","Simona Jankowski","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Moskowitz","Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of questions, I wondered if you could drill a little deeper into what was going on with the slowdown in the forecasted sales in the U.S. Can you talk a little about those drivers, and maybe even quantify the revenue that slipped maybe into the current quarter and how much that revenue is?","John McAdam","No. Okay. Well, I mean, basically, very straightforward, I mean, the sales force believed that we\u2019re going to get some closed deals and they didn\u2019t happen. And they can happen for all sorts of reasons. It could be the CFO stopping at the last minute. It could be optimism from the sales force. I mean, these things happen and you try and take account of that.","Nothing - in terms of talking about metrics, remember we did right at top of our range at - in terms of last quarter from the revenue perspective, so clearly any small number of deals above that is a very, very good thing to have. But we\u2019re not talking about massive amounts of slowdown, but, yes. I mean, when you are at the top of the range and you could go over and you see some slow deals, they\u2019re all important.","Mark Moskowitz","Okay. And then, as we think about the second-half of this year, with respect to the vertical mix, is there any one mix that you\u2019re more dependent on in terms of these new products really taking off and achieving some good adoption right out of the gate, or is it more balanced across enterprise and service provider and government?","John McAdam","Yes. I think it is pretty balanced personally. Anybody else can chip into this, but I think it\u2019s quite balanced. I mean, I\u2019ll out - there is one or two obvious things at the 100-gig board, right. That\u2019s clearly service providers mainly. But the big drivers of that remains security. The product refresh is across the board. We did mention a FIPS solution for finance. But I don\u2019t think that will change the dynamics of the verticals.","So not really, no, I don\u2019t see that. It\u2019s more horizontal.","Mark Moskowitz","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Catharine with Dougherty. Your line is now open.","Catharine Trebnick","Oh, thank you for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit, John, on your service provider market and how that\u2019s doing? Two years ago it was - opportunity seem to be with Traffix. The commentary seems to be around security, Gi Firewall.","John McAdam","Yes.","Catharine Trebnick","Just a little insight on what you are seeing there in the carrier environment. Thank you.","John McAdam","That\u2019s true. And the traffic sales have been reasonable, still low numbers to be frank, but reasonable over the last couple of quarters. We\u2019ve got lot of customer base. But, no, the thing that gets us excited at the moment, I mean, the Gi Firewall has done very well. When I retire - I talked a number of times about the Gi Firewall sales in the tier 1 in U.S. The good news is we\u2019re starting to see that globally now with sales in EMEA and sales in Asia and at Asia-Japan as well.","So we feel very good about that security in general. NFV, NFV is another big area for us. We think we got a great position there with NFV. We talked about where we\u2019re - we\u2019re looking to get a leading performance of 10-gig up to 40-gig. That will make a big difference in NFV. So, yes, they are the hot buttons for us right now.","Catharine Trebnick","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rohit with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Rohit Chopra","Thanks. I had a couple of questions for you, John. First one, if you could, talk a little bit more about the competitive environment. Just want to get a sense of what you\u2019re seeing in the traditional ADC market and from traditional vendors, but also cloud vendors. And then, could you also address what you\u2019re seeing in the security marketplace, the competition that you\u2019re facing there?","The second question was on the standalone security products. I just want to get a sense, is that a response to customers demanding something from you, something new from you or is it more of a defensive move to better compete with products from other vendors?","John McAdam","Okay. I\u2019m going to - I\u2019ll go to Karl.","Rohit Chopra","[Indiscernible] and et cetera.","John McAdam","I\u2019m going to pass this over to Karl. He\u2019s going to do this as in a Scottish accent.","Karl Triebes","Hey, Rohit, this is Karl. Hey, let me address the second question first on these kind of purpose-built security offerings, because one of the challenges we\u2019ve had with our current offering which addresses some significant security issues out there both with anti-fraud and web application security as well, just network-level security, is that that as it\u2019s included in on the ADC platform it tends to be targeted more towards the network buying centers versus the security buying centers, even though we do get good access to those.","And what we wanted to do was to take our functionality, help differentiate that by essentially packaging it ways that\u2019s more consumable by these centers. And so for example DDoS, we provide comprehensive DDoS solution both for on-premises as well as in Silverline. And we now connect these, but we want to make it easier now for someone then to take that on-prem solution, configure it and get the benefits of that, without having to do the full ADC configuration.","Same thing for things like SSL Air Gap and in our for proxy services, that we see that these things are difficult to configure sometimes when you start looking at the full sphere of what an ADC does and want to make that easier to consume and target these applications. There are other ones we would like to be able to do that with.","And we want to increase the value of this by including like analytics and other things that that we can differentiate say from our Good, Better, Best offering. So it just allows us more precise Better targeting. It also allows us to contrast and differentiate this against existing solutions in the market versus trying to have this larger conversation around ADC level security. So it\u2019s really more just being able to build on top of what we\u2019ve already done, but differentiate it with the platform.","In terms of the first question on competition, we haven\u2019t really seen a big change there in terms of our traditional competitors. Citrix is still kind of sitting in there. We didn\u2019t see any real change in terms of loss wins or anything like that. In fact, in the field we generally hear that they\u2019ve - the competitiveness is down. They are same with Atenants [ph] and the other smaller competitors; they pop up here and there.","They mainly still compete on price and then lower functionality, and then make target-specific counts. But in general, broadly, we haven\u2019t really seen any changes there. And there is kind of the next generation of these kinds of cloud-based ones that are coming up here and there.","Really haven\u2019t seen much there, some noise out in the market little bit here and there that we see. But in terms of like account wins, there\u2019s been a number of large customer accounts within where we\u2019ve actually seen them pop up and then leave. We\u2019ve been able to win those.","So it hasn\u2019t been a real change for us in terms of business. Obviously, with cloud, Amazon for example, they have a very low-end load balancer that they use to provide very basic services. But Amazon is a big partner of ours and we do quite a bit of business with providing insertion of our products into their cloud, so same with - or same with Microsoft Azure.","So with the cloud there is opportunities and small threats, but quite frankly we don\u2019t see any different the environment that we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Rohit Chopra","Thanks, Karl.","John DiLullo","Yes. This is John DiLullo. I would just add that we did have a lot of energy in the competitive trade-out space, in particular some of the legacy environments versus the greenfield. So it\u2019s a very good quarter for that.","Rohit Chopra","Thanks, John.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Kelleher","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Could you tell us what percent of product revenue is subscription? What part of that is coming in from cloud and Silverline? And is that creating a headwind or do you anticipate that to create a headwind as buying pattern shift?","Andy Reinland","Yes. So we actually don\u2019t disclose it. It\u2019s still, as John said in his script early days, that we like the traction that we are seeing, we like the customers that we\u2019re winning and expect that to continue. In terms of providing headwinds, I\u2019m not sure what you mean by that. Do we think it displaces appliances? No, we don\u2019t. We think it\u2019s complementary to our current offerings and actually it is part of our differentiation.","Mark Kelleher","So when the customer purchases something that is the subscription base, you don\u2019t see that as detracting from current sales in the current quarter.","John McAdam","No, no. Especially if you look at the DDoS wins, a lot of them we never heard of the customers and maybe had an emergency and allows us to actually get into new customers. And that\u2019s one of the reasons we say. We\u2019re really going to pump up the resources in Silverline, because we think we\u2019re going to be a winner there with - in terms of inside sales specifically and obviously more resources in the portfolio as well as we have increased - we\u2019ve put quite a lot of investment into the datacenters globally.","Mark Kelleher","Okay. Can you just talk about the ACE replacement market where that is - are we losing steam in that? Is that kind of playing itself up?","John McAdam","Yes. I mentioned in my opening remarks that, yes, it\u2019s still a pretty material number in terms of millions-of-dollars that we\u2019re booking there. And we saw some nice new big ones as well, but in truth, if you look at it from a year-over-year perspective it certainly doesn\u2019t have the tailwind that did at last year and the previous years. But it\u2019s still an important part of our business.","The other side of it, not to lose sight of is, because we don\u2019t count at this when we talk of ACE replacements, but when we win say a Fortune 50 company, we\u2019ve done a few of those because of ACE, we get more and more business like security. We don\u2019t actually call that ACE replacements moving forward. So it\u2019s being great for us. It\u2019s not the tailwind that it was last year having said that.","Mark Kelleher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Paul with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Paul Silverstein","Thanks. John, and if this was asked and answered, I apologize. But relative to your comment about record bookings in AsiaPac and EMEA, if I heard you correctly, and then on the guidance, would you characterize this conservative?","And we all recognize the macro factor up, but I guess my question is, given the strength in bookings abroad, but not in the U.S. little bit counterintuitive to me, how much - it feels like that guidance is incorporating an element of conservatism given the bookings numbers. But, I guess, I\u2019m trying to - I\u2019m really trying to understand what you\u2019re seeing in terms of in-demand as its developing?","John McAdam","Yes, yes. No, and I hope it\u2019s got a lot of conservatism, because that\u2019s what it should have I think in this environment.","Now, first of all it\u2019s not abnormal for EMEA to have a very strong sales quarter at the end of a calendar year. It\u2019s happened in the past. Having said that, they tend to have a tougher next quarter, this current quarter that we\u2019re in and we\u2019ve taken account of that.","APAC, we\u2019ve seen a lot of changes in APAC. We have put new management in there over a year ago. He is doing a tremendous job and we\u2019re really - we come to see the benefits of that. So that wasn\u2019t that surprising either.","In terms of Americas, one of the things we did see and we haven\u2019t seen this yet, but we did see that from a vertical perspective that service provider was pretty strong. We did see a little bit of the drop in Americas. We actually feel better about that this current quarter as well, so no real big trend to latch onto.","Paul Silverstein","But, John, on the Americas piece where you saw weakness, how much of that was the pause in those large deals, the delays, and how much of it was broader in terms of just a downturn in demand?","John McAdam","I would call it more of a pause. We actually we - we\u2019re reasonably confident moving into these closing stages. And obviously that confidence was misplaced in Americas, but, no, I didn\u2019t - it was more of a pause at the end. And then, what we have done? We just checked actually today. We\u2019ve basically seen a number of those deals that didn\u2019t close, actually closed already.","Paul Silverstein","All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.","John McAdam","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from George with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","George Notter","Hi, guys. Thanks very much. I guess, I wanted to go back to the deferred revenue growth, 23% year on year. And obviously, that number is going up quite a bit faster than - now either product sales also declining or services which are, I guess, mid-teens in terms of year on year. And I would imagine some of the deferred revenue - our performances is - maybe Silverline certainly maybe more longer term services contracts. But can you give us a sense, again, why the diversion and what are the big contributors to that deferred revenue growth relative to the other metrics? Thanks.","John McAdam","So on the deferred revenue balance, the first statement to make is Silverline is not in that at all. So that\u2019s a completely separate balances in the product number, not in the services piece. The reason for the services deferred acceleration versus the revenue is, yes, you\u2019re right, some of it is - support contracts are taking out for year-two and year-three. And we saw some of that in the BRIC countries, where they try and do guarantee the price out into the second and third year.","So, Brazil actually was quite strong for us there. And then the other piece is our consulting revenue has grown, but the consulting bookings have grown fast as we\u2019ve sold more consultants for a year at a time which you cannot obviously take the revenue in the short-term.","George Notter","Got it, okay. Great. That helps. And then, just separately I wanted to ask about the share repurchase this quarter. It looks like you bumped it up to $200 million. It had been $150 million a quarter. Maybe, I guess I\u2019m kind of wondering what\u2019s going on there. Thanks a lot.","Andy Reinland","I\u2019m sorry. I missed the question.","John McAdam","Share repurchase [indiscernible].","Andy Reinland","Yes. When the board decides to move forward with the share repurchase we put it against the 10b5-1 plan that has tiering for different pricing levels and we saw that kick in.","George Notter","Great, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question\u2026","John Eldridge","Excuse me, Sam. This is John Eldridge. We\u2019re going to take two more callers and then call quits.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And our next question is from Jeff with Nomura. Please state your - or please go ahead with your question.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Thanks very much for taking the question. I appreciate that. I have one question for you, John, and then, Andy, one for you. I think for John, could you help us in maybe feel for any sub-seasonal - should we worry about sub-seasonal revenue growth ahead of these product transitions over the next several quarters or do you feel that your pipeline is efficient and full enough that seasonal is a prudent way to go, to the extent that you can comment on that, of course?","John McAdam","Oh, yes. And obviously, you have to be very careful about that. If you look at the time, a few years ago or three years ago I think it was when we did the last product refresh, we did it. We frankly took a year to do the refresh. And I think we paid for that. And we will not take a year this year. We will do it quicker.","But when we look at the pipeline, we don\u2019t - we think we\u2019re okay. We think we\u2019re going to manage through that quite well. And obviously, we will start most of the - a lot of the new products is next quarter. And some of them are on different areas, brand new areas, so that we should be safe with that. And then, the larger product refresh we see happening in this sort of Q4 time scales, and again I think we\u2019ll manage through that.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Okay. And then, my question for you Andy is, you look like you are adding about 50 employees in the March quarter, which if we go back historically that seems in the low end of the range or be even below the low end of the range for you. Can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening there? And then, should we be expecting you to pick that up? I\u2019m wondering if there is a change in view on how you\u2019re managing your OpEx and your margin structure over time. Thanks.","Andy Reinland","Yes, there\u2019s no change in how we\u2019re managing. And I said at least 50, meaning it could be higher. We\u2019re just going to balance that as we watch the quarter roll out, but directly ties to our guidance. So we brought on 95 last quarter; we\u2019re absorbing them this quarter. And with our guidance and wanting to hit our targets that we put out there, 50 is the right number to start with.","Jeffrey Kvaal","Okay. All right. Thank you both very much.","John McAdam","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question is from Brent with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Brent Bracelin","Thanks for squeezing me in. And, John, welcome back. Two questions, if I could. I guess, one, strategically you\u2019ve lived through several cycles and if we think about kind of the next cycle in the next kind of - but your philosophy on what you do with a-billion-plus in cash investments; cash flow remains very strong; really good margin structure. As you think about kind of the current environment and certainly we\u2019re in, do you have a change relative to your appetite to maybe get more aggressive with the buyback, more aggressive with acquisitions, any change in your strategic positioning around being a bigger company with bigger cash flows and your appetite to invoke change more, one? And then, I have one follow-up.","John McAdam","Yes, okay. I wouldn\u2019t see a change. I mean, so I don\u2019t see as - I think you still see the conservatism that we\u2019ve hopefully always had in the M&A space. Frankly, evaluations look a little bit better these days, which is good-news\/bad-news; but that they do.","We may broaden the lens somewhat. Obviously, we\u2019re very, very interested in increasing our security business and that may be an area. But we will be conservative, but we are getting bigger. And, yes, so, I\u2019m saying we\u2019re not changing, but the company is getting bigger. So to some degree we may look at some other stuff that we wouldn\u2019t have looked at five years ago.","Brent Bracelin","Very helpful. Then my last question really is around kind of the logic behind the announcement here on the call that you\u2019re kind of looking at purpose-built appliances. And the reason why I ask, it is a little bit of a departure from the past, historically obviously. And if you look at the fastest-growing parts of the business, it\u2019s kind of software-only; it\u2019s add-on security modules on top of the BIG-IP. Now, you\u2019re talking about kind of coming out with purpose-built appliances. So, I guess, one, kind of why now? And, two, how encompassing will you have a purpose-built appliance portfolio?","John McAdam","Oh, yes. So this isn\u2019t a move to purpose-built appliances in general. I mean, we - it\u2019s not that. However, we see some real opportunities with things like SSL Intercept with SSL Air Gap with specific DDoS behavior analysis type capability. We just - we see opportunities. And, I mean, it\u2019s catalog-only for this. But it\u2019s a fairly easy technology roadmap to move forward to. So we\u2019re going to take advantage of that. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re - we sat back and said, oh, my goodness, we need to move away from our TMOS platform approach to special.","But we haven\u2019t done that at all. In fact, if you look at what we\u2019re doing with that we were building VIPRION with 100-gig, it\u2019s almost the opposite in the other side. And then, when you look at the overall refreshes, they are very much in the same vein as have been before.","Brent Bracelin","Perfect.","Karl Triebes","Yes, I mean, the big push there - Brent, this is Karl - is really to target the buying centers, the security buying centers with it. So it\u2019s not the - not, we\u2019re not killing off TMOS. This is all still a part of that. But it\u2019s to have more application-specific implementations that are easy to deploy. And we\u2019re leveraging iApps and other technologies to kind of help create that packaging to make it easier to get in there, so that they can realize the full value of it, because quite frankly a lot of times some of the security functions would get buried kind of in the mass quantity of ADC features and functions we provide. We\u2019re going to make sure that\u2019s very obvious and easy to go take the market.","John Eldridge","Okay. Thank you very much.","Brent Bracelin","[Indiscernible] thanks so much.","Karl Triebes","Thank you.","John Eldridge","Thank you very much for joining us. And we look forward to the prospect of seeing many of you in the conference circuit and at Mobile World Congress during the coming quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, speakers.

My name is Frank Pelzer, and I'm very excited to discuss with you today our fiscal 2018 Q3 results and Q4 outlook. Q3 marked a return to product revenue growth, as we had another quarter of solid execution and delivery of results. We continued to see growing momentum with our software offerings, particularly solutions for multi-cloud architectures, and our services business delivered another quarter of strong revenue and profit.","Third quarter revenue was $542 million, up 4.7% year-over-year and came in above the midpoint of our guided range of $535 million to $545 million. GAAP EPS of $1.99 per share was above our guidance of $1.79 per share to $1.82 per share. This beat was largely driven by strength in revenue, expense discipline and a lower-than-expected effective tax rate. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.44 per share was also above our guidance of $2.36 to $2.39 per share.","In Q3, product revenue was $239 million, up 1.6% year-over-year and accounted for 44% of total revenue. Software was approximately 15% of product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Systems revenue made up approximately 85% of product revenue and declined 1.5% year-over-year. Services revenue was $303 million, up 7% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue.","On a regional basis, Americas grew 3% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 8% year-over-year and accounted for 24% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 15% of total, grew 8% year-over-year. And Japan, at 4% of total revenue, grew 4% from a year ago.","Sales to enterprise customers represented 64% of total revenue during the quarter. Service providers accounted for 19% of total revenue and government sales were 17%, including 7% from U.S. Federal.","In Q3, we had five greater than 10% distributors: Ingram Micro, which accounted for approximately 17% of total revenue; SYNNEX Corp. and Tech Data, which each accounted for approximately 11%. And Arrow and Westcon each represented approximately 10% of revenue.","I will now discuss our operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 83.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 84.5%, in line with our expectation. GAAP operating expenses of $299 million were at the lower end of our $297 million to $307 million guided range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $265 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q3 was 27%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 36%. Our GAAP effective tax rate was 20.4%, lower than expected due to tax benefits associated with our stock-based compensation expense in the quarter. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 23.3%.","Let's now discuss the balance sheet and other results. We generated $182 million in cash flow from operations, up 12% year-over-year, which contributed to cash and investments totaling over $1.4 billion at quarter-end. DSO at the end of the quarter was 49 days, flat with previous quarter.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were approximately $20 million, driven by our build-out of our new headquarters and international facilities expansion. Inventory at the end of the quarter was approximately $31 million.","Deferred revenue increased 9% year-over-year to just over $1 billion, driven by continued high-maintenance renewal rates. We ended the quarter with approximately 4,475 employees, up approximately 90 people from the prior quarter. In Q3, we purchased approximately 900,000 shares of our common stock and an average price of $166.22 per share, for a total of $150 million.","Now let me discuss our guidance for Q4. Based on strengthening pipeline and discussion with our sales organization, we see continuing momentum in the business as we close out the fiscal year. We expect to deliver another quarter of solid revenue growth with continued strength in product revenue. For the quarter, we are targeting revenue in the range of $555 million to $565 million.","Today, we announced an initiative to further align spend with our transformation to a leading provider of multi-cloud application services. Specifically, we will be accelerating investment in our roadmap and market development efforts in the fastest-growing areas of our business: cloud and security. As a result, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the range of $23 million to $25 million in Q4 that is reflected in our GAAP expense estimates. We do not anticipate that this action will impact our Horizon 1 or Horizon 2 financial guidance that we laid out for you in March.","In Q4, we expect GAAP gross margins of approximately 83%, including $5 million of stock-based compensation expense and $2 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. We anticipate non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expenses of $317 million to $329 million, including approximately $34 million of stock-based compensation expense, $23 million to $25 million in restructuring expense, and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","We expect a GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25% for the fourth quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate at or around 24%. Our Q4 GAAP earnings target is $1.77 to $1.80 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $2.61 to $2.64 per share.","On a final topic, I'm happy to report that my first few months as F5's CFO have gone very smoothly. I've had the opportunity to work with all areas and levels in the business and have been very impressed by the high quality and depth of knowledge of all F5 employees, particularly our world-class finance and accounting team. I would like to thank everyone for their warm acceptance of me to the organization and their tireless efforts in building a fantastic business.","With that, I will turn the call over to Fran\u00e7ois.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Frank, and good afternoon, everyone. During the third quarter, we saw continued momentum across the business with product revenue returning to growth. Software revenue continues to expand, driven by deployments in public and private cloud as our customers increasingly look to support and protect their applications across multi-cloud environments. We also saw strong demand for our security solutions, protecting enterprise customers against application-based threats.","Our software revenue continues to expand, growing 24% year-over-year. The pace of ELA and VE subscription software deals accelerated in Q3 as customers continued to embrace flexible consumption models, a trend we think will be important in driving adoption of our new cloud offerings, including our recently introduced BIG-IP Cloud Edition.","While Cloud Edition was just released to market at the end of May, we are already seeing strong interest and pipeline across the theaters. The early feedback from customers who purchased the product in Q3 confirms our view that right sized application services for every app opens up a large set of use cases that were not previously well addressed by existing software ADC offerings. We expect momentum for Cloud Edition to continue to build and that it will be a meaningful driver of software growth in FY 2019 and beyond.","In addition, we are seeing our customers increasingly choose to deploy a blend of both iSeries systems along with software in multi-cloud environments. Customers continue to utilize F5 security, application services and orchestration to seamlessly manage workloads across these hybrid environments. Our services business had another solid quarter with revenue up 7% year-over-year and deferred revenue of $1 billion. This team provides unparalleled customer support creating a significant differentiator and driving customer satisfaction.","The value of our services capabilities will only grow as the complexities associated with multi-cloud deployments become more prominent with our customers. We've shown strong execution during the third quarter for software solutions across all deployment environments with strength in public cloud both in Bring Your Own License and utility-based consumption. We also saw continued sequential growth for Enterprise License Agreements and subscription offerings. These offerings provide flexibility in procuring and deploying our virtual editions, leading to software expansion in service provider and enterprise accounts.","For instance, our ability to structure an ELA at a large U.S. financial services company helped create a high-capacity DNS infrastructure. The policy-based DNS functionality provides resiliency against outages across regional hubs. The deployment works across the three major clouds allowing the customer to choose the right cloud provider for the task at hand. This ELA is part of a multi-cloud software infrastructure and the customer continues to buy hardware systems to support a hybrid environment.","The traction we are seeing in software is augmented with the early success of BIG-IP Cloud Edition, which we officially launched on May 31. As a reminder, this release improved per-app visibility, analytics and auto scale capabilities. The solution provides app owners a virtual application delivery controller that can apply and automate policy when developing, deploying and securing applications across public and private clouds.","A large online services company in Asia purchased Cloud Edition to automate application deployment and shorten scale-out time. Utilizing BIG-IQ functionality paired with Cloud Edition, the customer was able to auto scale instances at the app level with analytics and seamless interoperability with other F5 solutions.","Application Protection continues to be a driver of security solutions with good momentum in our WAF offerings. A leading independent research firm identified F5 as a WAF leader with multiple consumption models, including the traditional Application Security Manager, Advanced Web Application Firewall and Silverline-managed service. In the first full quarter of sales, Advanced WAF is showing strong adoption from both new and existing customers. The operational ease of configuration and deployment is attracting new stand-alone security buyers.","A great example of this momentum in security is a competitive win at a European web hosting company, driven by our Advanced Web Application Firewall. The customer deployed Advanced WAF to protect their website portals and safeguard their brand reputation from application level compromised by sophisticated layer 7 DDoS attacks. The sales team participated in a competitive evaluation and demonstrated protection from bot-based attacks and superior behavior-based protection to catch subtle application layered DDoS attempts.","Highlighting our stated objective of offering stand-alone security products to a security buyer, today, we are introducing F5 SSL Orchestrator. This dedicated security solution allows ease of deployment and configuration for enterprise customers that demand orchestration with high performance decryption\/encryption and steering of SSL traffic. This product gives customers a security appliance offering dynamic service chaining across the security infrastructure.","Consistent with our approach presented in our Analyst & Investor Meeting in March, we will continue to expand our stand-alone security portfolio and, today, we also announced the availability of F5 Access Manager. Core enhancements include protection of sensitive data with adaptive authentication while providing access for authorized users, devices and APIs, guarding against pervasive threats such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Access Manager enables organizations to bridge on-prem app functionality to the cloud, effectively integrating with Identity-as-a-Service solutions to support evolving heterogeneous environments.","As we outlined over the past year, we are evolving to a multi-cloud application services company that will reach every app anywhere. With this in mind, we are realigning resources to better position F5 for 2019 and beyond. Today, we are taking steps to notify some employees that their roles are under consideration or will be eliminated in order to accelerate our hiring in geographic sales expansion, new sales go-to-market motions, multi-cloud software development and digital transformation initiatives. Our objective with these decisions is to further align our workforce with a long-term strategy and accelerate the transformation that we outlined in our Analyst & Investor Meeting earlier this year.","The long-term first vision set forth is seeing significant traction with continued momentum in software and security sales. Customers continue to view our solutions as mission-critical in hybrid environments as they deploy incremental workloads dynamically, both on premise and in-cloud environments. The expansion of our software asset portfolio and stand-alone security products positions us as the leader in multi-cloud application services.","Before moving on to the question-and-answer session, I wanted to highlight three key additions to the leadership team. First, I am excited to announce that Chad Whalen has been promoted to Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales. Chad joined F5 18 months ago and has built up our cloud sales team, while significantly deepening our partnerships with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services. Chad also brought to F5 a depth of experience that spans complex, large enterprises to fast-moving start-ups. His past leadership roles included Fortinet, World Wide Packets, Jasper and Ciena. Chad brings a combination of cloud, security, IoT and service-provider expertise that we will leverage in our transformation to become a multi-cloud application services leader.","We were also pleased to announce on July 11, that Mary Gardner joined the F5 team as our new Chief Information Security Officer. Mary is a seasoned security leader with extensive experience in the health and finance sectors, where the protection of highly sensitive customer data and compliance with stringent regulations are business-critical issues. Prior to F5, Mary has held security leadership roles at Seattle Children's Hospital, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and kept information and networks safe at Port of Seattle and Washington Mutual, JPMorgan Chase.","Another important addition to our leadership team is James Feger who joined this month as General Manager for our service provider business. James comes to us after 14 years at CenturyLink, where he held multiple leadership roles supporting the design and operations of their network architecture, including his most recent role as Vice President of Network Virtualization. His hands-on insight into the challenges and opportunities service providers face as they roll out 5G, NFV and IoT services will be invaluable to F5 as we expand our reach and role in these environments.","I would like to welcome Chad, Mary and James to their roles on the F5 leadership team. As always, I would like to thank the entire F5 team and our partners for their efforts during the third quarter.","With that, we will now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Samik from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to start off with a question on the restructuring that you announced today. How should I think about the payback on that kind of restructuring? Is it sort of the intention here let's say is to sort of improve margins on the systems product? Or how should I think about impact on the financials longer term?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Samik. Well, the first thing I'd say about the restructuring is that I genuinely don't like having to make these decisions because ideally and philosophically we would like to embark every employee that's been part of the journey with F5 into this exciting future that we're building with the company. The executive team has taken immense consideration on this because we know that we are making decisions that impact the lives of many of our colleagues and friends.","That being said, we are very focused on the transformation of F5 into a multi-cloud application services leader, and as a result, there is legacy spend that we have that is less relevant for the future than it has been for the past, and we are shifting our focus to the growth areas of F5, and specifically, we are intensifying our investments into software and multi-cloud technologies, in new go-to-market motions, and also in building the necessary digital infrastructure that enables those go-to-market motions. And so today's restructuring is really not about cost-cutting. It really is about realignment of resources towards these areas and accelerating the execution of our strategy.","In terms of how you should think about this action as it relates to long-term financial model, it's all very consistent with what we shared at our Analyst & Investor Meeting in March, and so this action has no implied change in our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2 guidance, so this is FY 2019, FY 2020 and also FY 2021, FY 2022.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it, got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow up, you mentioned that you're seeing good traction on your stand-alone security products. Can you maybe share any kind of metrics in terms of either customer count or anything like that so that we can track your progress on that front? And also, are your leaders thoughts that you can sort of pursue that opportunity organically or are you open to sort of looking at maybe bolt on acquisitions to bolster your capabilities on that front?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Samik, I'll start with the latter part of your question. In terms of acquisitions I think we've touched on this before. I've said that I consider acquisitions to be a potential tool in the execution of our strategy as a technology company. If and when we find that there's an opportunity that makes sense, we will execute on that. And the key for me is that we continue to be disciplined in our investments, whether they be investments in organic innovation or potential investments in inorganic innovation in the future, that we take a very disciplined approach to both. And that's part of what you're seeing in our actions today.","In terms of the tractions that we're getting with our new stand-alone security offerings, we don't disclose customer counts, but I can tell you that the new stand-alone security solutions that we have announced we have already won a number of customers with those including a number of customers that are net new customers to F5. And the thing that is for me a significant sign of the traction we're getting there is in a number of these deals we're winning with our SSL orchestration solutions or our Advanced WAF solutions, we are not competing with any ADC vendors. We're really only competing with traditional or next-generation security vendors and our win rate is very strong.","As a good example of that is if you take our SSL Orchestration solution we've just released, it really is a use case that is absolutely critical to the security infrastructure, largely because most of the traffic now is encrypted, and sort of traditional security appliances are not very efficient at doing this encryption\/decryption work in addition to the security service they have to offer.","And so in this case, actually, F5's hardware, security hardware, is extremely efficient than encryption\/decryption and we marry that with an intelligent policy-based chaining of security services. And that allows us to provide a service chain across the full security stack and really nobody else can do that. So that's just a great use case for how our stand-alone security solutions are performing and it is absolutely in line with our strategy to be the leader in application security.","Samik X. Chatterjee - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful color. Thank you. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sami Badri from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you for the question. I was hoping if you could give us maybe potentially an attach rate of the software and security revenues to specifically hardware sales in the quarter. And if you cannot really specifically answer that question with a tangible number, maybe you could give us an idea of this trend this quarter versus prior year. And then I have a follow-up after that.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Sami, I don't think we can give you an attach rate specifically. What I think we can share with you is two things. One is you continue to see growth in our software essentially in line with what we shared at the investor meeting, that software would grow in the mid-20s for the year and we're confident this is essentially where we're going to land. And that's true across both our software growth in ADC and our software growth in security. I think that has been the consistent trend over the number of quarters.","The other thing we can share with you is a large number of deals, even in security, I would say, a growing percentage of our business even in ADC, sorry, is actually driven by security use cases. And so we don't break that out and we don't quantify that, but I'd say the traction in security is growing both in our ADC business as well as in our stand-alone security business.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then, at the Analyst Day, there were some comments alluding to an as-a-service product and the business model shift, et cetera. And I was hoping you kind of give us a little bit of an update around that and maybe any potential milestones or maybe just like a change of mind or anything like that? Could you just give us some color on that?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yes. Sami, we offer today a managed service where we essentially redirect traffic from some of our customers to scrubbing centers that are largely in Equinix data centers. And then, we perform a number of services in these scrubbing centers. And that managed service is Silverline and it continues to grow. We've added a number of customers again in the quarter.","In addition to that, we did say that in 2019 we would be bringing to market a solution we call F5-as-a-Service, which is a \u2013 it's a complete self-serve model that would be hosted in a public cloud and would address all of the DevOps buyers that want to go to a pure public cloud buying motion. We remain on track for that solution in 2019. We haven't announced the date yet, and we will as we get closer to delivering on that.","Sami Badri - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is open.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just give us some qualified sizing around the growth rate in the security business. I know you don't want to break out the dollar value of it, but it would be helpful if you could at least talk about roughly what the rate of change in that business is. And then second, if you could talk a little bit about what portion of your business is coming from SaaS or cloud-related footprint that would be helpful as well?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Alex, thank you. I'm going to disappoint you on both counts because I can't give you numericals. And it's not just that we won't, but let me start with security. In security, our business is both some stand-alone security use cases as well as security-driven use cases in our ADC business. And sometimes breaking that out is actually quite subjective on our part. And this is one of the reasons that we don't disclose that information. I can, on the other hand, share with you that security as a whole is one of the faster growing areas of our business. So it is growing faster than the aggregate revenue, if you will.","As it relates to public cloud, again, we don't today \u2013 we may in the future, but we don't today purely break out public cloud revenues. Public cloud is actually the fastest-growing part of our business. And we continue to drive customers to public cloud, both buying their license and instant sharing it in public cloud or buying into our systems on a utility basis. I've shared that we're now billing millions of hours per quarter on all the major public clouds. And our cloud edition we just released, actually, we expect to accelerate that because it makes it easy for customers to burst some of their applications into a public cloud and leveraging our auto-scale capabilities. So that's where we see significant acceleration of our software solutions in the future. But I just can't quantify it for you yet.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Could I follow-up, though? You last quarter had given positive comments on both your million-dollar deals as well as, I think the term you used was accelerating pipeline of deals that you're chasing. Can you at least qualify something around that? Is there any change? Or is there any reason why didn't mention that this time around?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","No. There's no reason we didn't mention it, Alex. As we kind of predicted last quarter, we saw a growing number of seven-figure software deals. These are typically ELAs, Enterprise License Agreements. And we're seeing, we only released these offerings about nine months ago. And sequentially every quarter over the last three quarters, we have seen the traction in pipeline with this consumption model growing with our customers. And this quarter, we had a record number of such deals on software and on these Enterprise License Agreements. They are particularly important to us because we can land customers on these deals and over time expand them as they add to their initial subscription. So, generally pretty excited about what's happening with the large million-dollar plus software deals that we are seeing.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","So that's a strong number in the quarter and strong pipeline? Just to be sure I got it right.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Correct.","Alex Henderson - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. I'll cede the floor. Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Alex.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Thanks for the question. I appreciate it. I guess I want to ask kind of a question about the progress of software again. But the real question I have is, when you guys think you might release some KPIs that would help us quantify this so that we can understand either maybe what proportion of product revenue the software sales are or some other KPI that you've got in mind that would help us track actual quantifiable progress on that strategy. So that's, I guess, one question.","Another one is related to that, which is deferred revenue, which was flat quarter-on-quarter. And I guess we expect the software products to be pretty small at this point, but that deferred revenue suggests there's not a whole lot of movement in the direction of software yet from the point of view of the overall revenue. So I'm just curious. Is that true or is there a bunch of some more software deferred revenue in there than we think, and if we could see the breakdown, we would see more progress? Thanks.","Francis J. Pelzer - F5 Networks, Inc.","Sure. Rod, it's Frank. Let me take that one. So, on the KPI question, I would say as the business becomes more material, we'll consider certain KPIs that you can continue to track. At this point we're talking about the growth rates that we've experienced in the business, particularly on the software side, as an indication of the strength that we're seeing in that business.","I think on your second question on the deferred revenue, it was actually up I think close to 7%, 1.7% quarter-over-quarter but 7% year-over-year. And we talked about that's really still the continued strength that we've seen in the maintenance on the ELA side, and it's just a smaller portion of our total revenue. And so, it really doesn't have a major move yet in the deferred revenue piece.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Frank, can I follow-up? The other thing we noticed is APAC and Japan. The Japanese decline was lower. APAC growth is better. Just curious if you guys have any further color on what drove those continued changes and trajectory there. It seems like things are improving.","Francis J. Pelzer - F5 Networks, Inc.","I think it's positive market dynamics, particularly in some emerging economies that we haven't necessarily had as much presence in before, particularly China and India. And so we were really excited to report that kind of growth, and I think we've got a really strong team that's executing quite well.","Rod Hall - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason from William Blair. Your line is open.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. Fran\u00e7ois, in our VAR checks, we picked up some challenges with ELA pricing with certain large enterprise accounts. Can you talk about how some of the pricing discussions are playing out? I mean, it sounds like you're positive on the progress there. But are there some kinks that still need to be worked out?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Hi, Jason. Let me start with the latter part first. This is the first year of us offering ELAs and subscriptions, and so no doubt there is an element of learning as we go through the first deals and kind of readjust this as we learn more and also as the volume of these deals continues to increase. That being said, there is not a particular challenge on pricing that we've picked up in those deals. In fact, if anything, if we just look at discounting levels, we think the discounting levels in these types of deals are less than in traditional perpetual software deals. So we're pretty encouraged by the early trends around what we're seeing in terms of customer adoption. So there is not a challenge specifically with ELA or subscription deals.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. I guess what I was talking about is \u2013 what I meant by challenges is, we just heard that in some of the \u2013 there were some transactions where customers just pushed back on the pricing. So was that it was too expensive, not \u2013 it's consistent with what you said, that there's not as much discounting. So maybe we just maybe picked up a couple of isolated instances, but it sounds like you're feeling good about that learning process and adjusting as necessary.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yes, we're feeling very good about it, Jason. There's always an element of course of negotiation with our customers, but we're feeling very good about the pricing, but also the consumption model. Our ELAs are unique in that we allow customers to consume and add sort of consumption or throughput to their licenses during a period of time and then we true it up after that. And once our customers really understand the consumption model that we're giving in these ELAs, they realize there's tremendous value in these ELAs and the adoption is pretty strong. So if your question is, are we losing ELA deals because of pricing? The answer is absolutely no.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up, did you say systems were down 1% year-over-year? Is that what I heard, revenue?","Francis J. Pelzer - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yes, 1.5%.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And how did that compare to your expectations?","Francis J. Pelzer - F5 Networks, Inc.","It was in line with our expectations.","Jason N. Ader - William Blair & Co. LLC","That's it for me. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Fish from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey guys, thanks for the question. I just wanted to first ask on the competitive dynamics because we didn't hear too much about that outside of essentially the stand-alone security space. Can you just give us an update on the landscape there as related to the last question regarding pricing, and especially as it relates to some of the private vendors like Cloudflare and the recent announcement from Cisco and Avi Networks?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yes. Thank you, James. So on the competitive landscape we really like where things are going in the virtual ADC space. In particular, we're very happy with the traction we've gotten with our BIG-IP Cloud Edition. It's just been in the market for one month. We already have a substantial number of wins. And what's happening essentially James is we are offering things that have not been available in the market before. For the first time we are enabling applications teams to self-service on their ADC which is opening up new use cases. We're also for the first time enabling app teams to auto scale their solution.","So for applications that are bursty, that's a very important capability, one of the companies I mentioned in the script is an online services company in Asia. They really purchased Cloud Edition because they have naturally a bursty traffic. They have a sort of seasonable demand to their solutions, and so our ability to burst the capabilities and for them to really pay for only what they're using is absolutely critical. And all of that we're offering at the lower total cost of ownership than a traditional VE.","And so customers have not been able to get that from a vendor that has both the depth of features that we have and the world-class support that F5 brings to the table. And we see that as a substantial change in the ADC market, so we're very positive on our competitive position. And as I said before in terms of ELA and subscription deals, we're doing well there and we're not seeing a significant challenge from any of the other consumption models you mentioned.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. That's very helpful color, Fran\u00e7ois. Just one last one from me on the new F5 Access Manager. Correct me if I'm wrong, you were previously partnering with a leading provider that's cloud-based that essentially F5 was doing the off \u2013 the on-premise environment and the partner was doing the on-premise. Is this new product just integrating them more? Or did you come out with your own off-premise solution in this new release?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","This new release, James, is really targeted at customers that want to deploy on-prem or want to deploy across multi-cloud. And so it allows customers to essentially augment their capacity from on-prem to a private cloud or a multi-cloud in a seamless way and really for them to auto scale the capability as they need it. So it's not affecting a particular partner. It's more that we are really truly obsessed with what our customers want to do next. And we're delivering an innovation in the way they want to consume the technology that they had been asking for.","And in fact, in some cases, because they didn't have that solution from F5, they were looking at potentially other solutions, either from start-ups or open source players. And we're now seeing that we are intercepting some of these proof-of-concepts and having significant win rate, because, ultimately, they want these solutions from a vendor that they trust and that has the capability to support them across multiple environments.","James E. Fish - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, James.","Operator","Our next question comes from Catharine from Dougherty. Your line is open.","Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Just one question on the service provider market, Fran\u00e7ois. What are the opportunities you're really targeting in 2019? Your revenue's been hovering about 19% to 21% aggregate. And I'm just curious of what you think the opportunities are going forward in the carrier segment.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Catharine. So I'll speak a little bit short-term and longer-term. In the short run, we continue to see a great traction with security, firewall solutions, carrier-grade firewall solutions especially in the service provider market, because the increase in traffic \u2013 in mobile traffic in particular, requires the scalability that our hardware, specifically our VIPRION solutions provide. And so that's going to continue to grow.","And then, there's a number of use cases that are pretty immediate short-term that are also driving demand for our hardware, things like IoT with their high transactional-type applications drive significant demand for our hardware in the carrier space. If we take a more of a longer-term perspective, a number of carriers are looking to virtualize their infrastructure. And the more they move to virtualization, the more they need solutions for, a) traffic management and, b) security. Those two challenges become more important as they virtualize their environment. And F5 is a leading player in both areas.","And so we're taking really more deliberate steps and more strategic investment in these areas as evidenced by us bringing onboard James Feger and some of the announcements we've made around what we're doing in the NFV space really to make sure we are aligned with these 5G architectures, with these virtualized architectures, because our customers are asking for more from F5 as a partner as they evolve their architectures.","Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you. And just a quick product question. Orchestrator's been out for almost two years. Is this a newer feature functionality that you're speaking about today?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","No, that's a great nuance. We've had an SSL Orchestrator solution recently, but there were two things with it. One is it required a significant level of, if you will, professional service or customization from F5 to make the solution work in a specific environment. And two, it was only consumable when attached to an ADC. The solution we're now releasing is going to significantly expand the addressable market for F5 in two ways.","Number one, a lot of the customizations that we built with our customers over the last couple of years, we've really now productized all these customization. And therefore, the consumption motion or the ease of deployment is much greater for our customers. And so we would expect to see a lot more velocity in the deployment of these solutions. And number two, we've made substantial changes to the solution with things like ease of configuration, that make the solution consumable by a security buyer not attached to an ADC. And that allows us to address a new part of the market, playing purely with security vendors.","Catharine Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the year-over-year product growth. I want to ask about that. Have we reached an inflection point where that number should now be increasing each quarter? Another way to ask that, is the software growth now sufficient to outgrow the decline in the systems business?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Well, Mark, a couple of things. One is I think we are \u2013 our view is unchanged from what we shared with you in March that our expectation is that in 2019 what we will see \u2013 2019 and 2020, it was said we would see low to mid single-digit growth overall that will most likely be low in 2019 and mid in 2020, in part, because of a, I'd say, small decline in the systems business and continued strong growth in the software business. All the indicators we've seen since March tend to validate that that is what I think we'll see in 2019.","One needs to be careful about taking too much sort of conclusions from a single quarter because now that we're disclosing our software number, which is still a relatively \u2013 it's only 15% of product revenue, so it's still a relatively small number. Quarter-to-quarter that can be lumpy. We can see a high software growth quarter and a low software growth quarter, but when you look at it on an annual basis, the trends that we've talked are really going to continue.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.","All right. And just as a follow up to some of the growth numbers, if we look at Enterprise, Service Providers and Government, if I did the math right, you had a very strong Government quarter, kind of offset the weakness in the other two, which is a reversal of the March quarter. What can we expect in terms of seasonality from those three segments going forward?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","So, Mark, again, I wouldn't take too much from the quarter-to-quarter iterations. Federal has a sort of natural cycle where we see typically stronger Federal in the latter half of the year and less in the first part of the year. Service Provider generally is a segment that's fairly lumpy for us, and I think not just for us but for most vendors that are in that space. I think North American CapEx in particular this quarter was a little soft. I think we're seeing that in our Service Provider numbers, but I wouldn't be able to predict to you where we're going to see seasonality in the Service Provider space.","Mark Kelleher - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Dennis Melton - F5 Networks, Inc.","Operator, can we do one last question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from James from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. This is Meta Marshall for James. Sort of following up on Catharine's question in the Service Provider business, typically that's been around 20% to 25% of the business. With kind of the enhancements that you've made, is there a target percentage of the business that you see being Service Provider? And then just second question, the EMEA business was kind of particularly strong. Do you think that that was some of getting past GDPR? Or was there a particular trigger? Or just weak compares? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, Meta. I'll start with Europe, we're pleased with the growth we had in Europe year-over-year. I think some of that \u2013 if you recall, we said last fall that we were making a realignment of our resources in Europe to address where we thought there was better growth opportunities, and I think to some extent we're seeing the benefit of that play out in the growth. And the team in Europe actually has executed very well over the last few quarters.","We are cautious about Europe because we're still seeing \u2013 the macro uncertainty is not gone completely, specifically with the UK and Brexit. So we don't want to get too carried away with what we're seeing in Europe, but we're pleased with the performance this quarter and specifically the execution of our teams.","In the Service Provider space, Meta, we don't have a specific target for a percentage of our business because over time we expect our Enterprise and Fed business to continue to grow, and we expect our Service Provider business to grow as well.","The one thing I would say is in the Service Provider space, especially as you go through architectural changes, changes in the amount of business happen over a period of time. And right now we're making I think strategic and deliberate investments in that space that will play out over our Horizon 1 and Horizon 2, especially as it relates to NFV.","Meta A. Marshall - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Dennis Melton - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Yes, I'm sorry.","Dennis Melton - F5 Networks, Inc.","Oh, no.

F5 closed fiscal 2016 with a strong finish. Both revenue and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 came in above our guidance as a result of solid year-over-year sales growth in the Americas, APAC and Japan. And healthy demand for our existing products ahead of our appliance refresh that began rolling out in mid-September.","Revenue of $525.3 million was up 6% from the prior quarter, and 5% year-over-year and above our guided range of $515 million to $525 million. GAAP EPS was $1.64 per share, above our guidance of $1.44 per share to $1.47 per share. Non-GAAP EPS of $2.11 also exceeded our guidance of $1.92 to $1.95 per share.","Q4 product revenue of $253 million, up 9% from Q3 and down 2% from Q4 of last year, represented 48% of revenue. Service revenue of $272.4 million increased 3% sequentially, 12% year-over-year, and accounted for 52% of revenue.","On a regional basis, Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue. EMEA revenue grew 4% year-over-year and accounted for 23% of overall revenue. APAC revenue, which accounted for 14% of the total, increased 1% year-over-year, and Japan at 4% of total revenue, was up 13% from a year ago.","During the quarter, enterprise customers represented 64% of total sales. Service providers accounted for 18% and government sales were 18%, including 10% from U.S. Federal. In Q4, we had three greater than 10% distributors. Westcon, which accounted for 18% of total revenue; Ingram Micro, which accounted for 15.2%; and Avnet at 12.5%.","Continuing down the income statement, GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 83.8%, non-GAAP gross margin was 85.2%. GAAP operating expenses of $277.8 million were at the low end of our $276 million to $285 million guided range.","Non-GAAP operating expenses were $242.7 million. Our GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31% and non-GAAP operating margin was 39%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.1% and our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 31.9%.","Turning to the balance sheet. In Q4, we generated $204 million in cash flow from operations, which contributed to cash and investments totaling $1.16 billion at year-end. DSO was 46 days. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $17.6 million. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $34.1 million. Deferred revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $870.2 million.","In Q4, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $124.31 per share, for a total of $150 million. Approximately $774 million remains authorized under the current share repurchase program. And in Q4, we increased our head count by 70 employees to 4,395.","For the full year, revenue for fiscal 2016 was just under $2 billion, up 4% from fiscal 2015. Product revenue of $944.5 million was down 5% from the prior year and accounted for 47% of total revenue. Service revenue of $1.05 billion grew 13% during the year and represented 53% of the total.","GAAP net income for fiscal 2016 was $365.9 million, or $5.38 per share. And non-GAAP net income was $496.2 million, or $7.30 per share. And for all of fiscal 2016, cash flow from operations totaled $712 million.","Moving onto our guidance for Q1 and our fiscal year 2017 outlook, we encouraged by increasing customer demand for all the new products we introduced in the second half of fiscal 2016, in particular for our new family of BIG-IP appliances, the Shuttle series, which we launched in September. We expect to finish the rollout of these products in November and we anticipate a steady ramp in sales as they replace sales of our existing appliance family over the course of this year.","As we look to Q1, we expect to see the normal seasonality that accompanies the start of a new fiscal year. In addition, we anticipate a continued challenging sales environment within EMEA over the short-term, particularly in the UK, which we have also factored in when assessing our revenue expectations for Q1.","With that in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we are targeting revenue in a range of $510 million to $520 million. We expect GAAP gross margins at\/or around 83%, including approximately $5 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $2.7 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets. Non-GAAP gross margins are anticipated at\/or around 84.5%. We estimate GAAP operating expense of $285 million to $294 million, including approximately $38 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $0.8 million in amortization of purchased intangible assets.","We anticipate a GAAP effective tax rate of 33% for the quarter and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31.5%. Our Q1 GAAP earnings target is $1.40 per share to $1.43 per share. Our non-GAAP earnings target is $1.92 per share to $1.95 per share. We believe, we will generate cash flow from operations at\/or around $200 million, and we plan to increase our head count by 60 employees to 80 employees during the quarter.","Looking out to the fiscal year ahead, our general planning assumptions and expectations are as follows. From the base of Q1, we anticipate sequential revenue growth throughout the year with the strong second half of the fiscal year. We anticipate the non-GAAP gross margins will remain in the 84% to 85% range.","We expect non-GAAP operating margins in the mid-30s% range for the first half of the year and increasing to the upper 30s% range over the second half. Stock-based compensation is anticipated to be in the range of $175 million to $185 million for the year.","Capital expenditures are expected to range from $15 million to $20 million per quarter for ongoing infrastructure investments and facilities expansions. And finally, we expect our effective tax rates to average approximately 32% to 34% on a GAAP basis and 31% to 33% on a non-GAAP basis for the year.","As John mentioned, our Analyst Investor Meeting will be November 17 in Chicago, we hope you can join us for this in-depth look at our business and our plans for fiscal 2017 and beyond.","With that, I will turn the call over to John McAdam.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Andy, and good afternoon, everyone. I will discuss the Q4 results in some detail and then outline the progress we have made during fiscal 2016 towards our goal of returning product revenue growth in fiscal 2017.","Overall, I was very pleased with F5 team's fiscal Q4 performance, including record revenues of $525 million, record cash from operations of $204 million, and record profitability with 39% non-GAAP operating margin. Many of the process, systems and training investments that we made throughout the year in our go-to-market engine together with the significant addition of new sales and marketing leadership talent began to bear fruit in fiscal Q4.","I'm especially encouraged by the improvement in sales and execution last quarter from the Americas region, which returned to year-over-year sales growth for the first time in several quarters. I view this as a significant milestone on our path to delivering consistent product revenue growth. I was also happy with the results for the Japan and our Asia-Pacific regions, which both delivered year-over-year sales bookings growth for the quarter and the entire fiscal year.","Sales bookings in EMEA however, were again done year-over-year, driven by weak sales in the UK. Once again our services business delivered strong results and excellent profitability with year-over-year revenue growth of 12%. As well as providing world class customer satisfaction, our service business has been crucial to our profitability throughout fiscal 2016.","We believe that there are several emerging market conditions that have increased the appeal of our products with enterprise and service provider customers in Q4. Firstly, customers are increasingly leveraging our products, not only for native security features, but also for the ability of our products to orchestrate and intercept SSL traffic laws.","Hackers today are more often leveraging SSL traffic for malware delivery, thereby making the F5 SSL orchestration and inspection capabilities more and more relevant. For example, a $5 billion healthcare organization deployed F5's iHealth application and in so doing, determined that 93% of its datacenter traffic was encrypted, and that is existing perimeter firewalls were being defeated by a flood of malicious and non-malicious traffic.","The ultimate resolution included deploying an F5 VE-based SSL solution, working in tandem with the Cisco FirePOWER intrusion prevention offering. This collaborative SSL orchestration solution was repeated more than a dozen times this quarter in several large global enterprises. Similarly, we experienced real traction with our anti-fraud WebSafe platforms in Q4. We believe this reflects both the increasing sophistication of bad actors focused on credential theft, as well as an explosion of SSL traffic in the transport of e-mail and other enterprise and public messaging applications. Our WebSafe product is very effective over SSL encrypted traffic, giving F5 very strong competitive differentiation with these solutions. We had a large win in Q4 with an Australian bank, who leveraged our WebSafe and MobileSafe anti-fraud capabilities to facilitate the protection of 10 million domestic and international banking customers.","The F5 solution provides a clientless private cloud capability to the bank, which uniquely met the requirements of their ever growing mobile banking clientele. A second emerging trend is the growth opportunity we are experiencing with customers, provisioning our proxy-based security solutions to deploy a consistent security stack and security policies across on-premise, off-premise and public cloud infrastructure such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.","Our multinational airline was suffering from brute force attacks against its web-based and private cloud assets. This customer leveraged a combination of our ASM WAF and Silverline WAF-as-a-Service offerings to mitigate unwanted package terms (17:06) and help them meet end-customer service delivery expectations.","This solution provided a set of IT administration abilities across its hybrid, public and private cloud environment, thus reducing management complexity and total cost of ownership.","Similarly two different banks in our Asia Pacific theater deployed BIG-IP ASM modules within the AWS environment to facilitate a public cloud migration of several customer facing internet banking sites.","Our solution allowed both banks to duplicate both their ASM functionality and their home-build library of iRules that they had optimized in their on-premise datacenter for use in the public cloud.","As we gain more and more experience of customers using F5 solutions to move their apps and workloads to public and private cloud architectures, we are convinced that this is yet a third-market trend with significant opportunities for F5.","Within our existing customers, I'm sorry, when our existing customers initiate lift and shift programs to move applications to the public cloud, they continue to view rich F5 ADC functionality such as programmability via iRules as critical for application optimization and application security.","For example, an international provider of SaaS-based workforce automation solutions leveraged our virtualization traffic management capabilities in the AWS environment to activate remote instances of their product in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom. Working together, AWS and F5 help the customer emulate the traffic management protocols and reuse the on-premise configuration details they had optimized and hardened over time.","The resulting solution greatly reduced the latency that the international customers had been experiencing when accessing the application remotely. This trend was further reinforced when our U.S. based provider of entertainment, media and streaming content, deployed our ADC solution in the Amazon Web Services environment. Our cloud-based solution allowed for rapid activation of additional streaming sessions, during on-demand style broadcasts when subscriber demand significantly exceeded expectations.","The content for these events is primarily delivered by the customers' private cloud. However, this joint F5 and AWS solution provided for a standby capacity, leveraging a hybrid cloud architecture.","From a product perspective, we delivered on our goal to commence shipments of a new range of appliances in Q4. This new product line-up known internally as a Shuttle series is perhaps the most comprehensive range of new products we have delivered to the market.","We started shipping the high-end products in the final weeks of the quarter and we expect to have the entire product range available by the end of November. As I have mentioned before the Shuttle series is more than a simple product line upgrade. We believe that the Shuttle series is the world's most programmable cloud-ready ADC. The Shuttle series provides the agility that DevOps organizations demand, together with the scale, security, investment protection that our traditional customers have long enjoyed.","In our quarterly conference call last January, when we announced our Q1 results, I gave a high-level view of the significant array of new products we had in our roadmap for delivery in fiscal 2016. The Shuttle series capped a tremendous year of product introductions in fiscal 2016, which will provide solid business drivers in the coming fiscal year, enabling the F5 team to achieve our goal of delivering product revenue growth throughout the year.","We saw very good traction in sales of our new 100-gig blade last quarter, and it was exciting to see a significant number of these sales taking advantage of the 100-gig blade's world-class performance to enhance solutions like the Gi firewall. Security, Gi LAN consolidation, NFV solutions, traffic steering and TCP optimization continue to be successful areas of focus for F5 in the service provider market.","Our vast array of new products including the Shuttle series, the SSL Orchestrator, the DDoS Defender, MobileSafe, iApps LX, BIG-IQ, and our iWorkflow orchestration engine, as well as our upcoming TMOS 13.0 release all further support our efforts to enable our customers to efficiently migrate their apps to private and public cloud architectures.","As far as fiscal 2017 Q1 outlook is concerned, Andy discussed our high-level financial views for fiscal 2017, and indicated that we expect to deliver revenue in the range of $510 million to $520 million in the first quarter. I believe that F5 is very well-positioned moving into fiscal 2017 to take advantage of the new products and business drivers, as well as the new opportunities including an explosion of SSL encrypted traffic, customers' requirements to have consistent security policies across on-premise and public clouds, and the move of application workloads to private and public cloud architectures.","We will be presenting our strategy in detail at the November Analyst Investor Conference. We have a lot to cover that day including details on our strategy and roadmap on several topics. For example, we will present our plans and progress on DevOp-centric architectures, including containerized Microservices, OpenStack, orchestration, and visibility and analytics. And I look forward to seeing you at the event.","In conclusion, I would like to thank the entire F5 team, our partners and customers for their support last quarter. And with that, we'll now hand the call over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you. Just two if I could. First, if we can just touch on Europe, it sounds like you've had some really good sales execution in the U.S. market. Is anything that could be done differently in Europe? Or is it just really too much macro that's going on there that might make that a little bit more challenging?","And then secondly, could you just update us on how trends for standalone security products and the software offerings trended in the quarter and the outlook for \u2013 into next fiscal year? Thank you.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Okay. On EMEA first of all, and I'll talk about EMEA, not just Europe, because that's where the organization is, first of all, we've had strong management in EMEA for a long time. And they actually had an excellent fiscal 2015, but definitely 2016 was problematic in some areas. I really believe that macro was definitely involved in the UK issue. One of the things that's probably unique to F5 more than a lot of the other companies is that, if you look at our major accounts regions, the financial sector is very, very important in that region. And frankly that was a tough market after the Brexit announcement where they seem to be taking some time to make up their mind as to where they're going to deploy their money moving forward.","So, having said that you always look at execution and we continue to do that, but I think it was more macro. In terms of the standalone product, I mean SSL, you heard me talking about SSL and orchestration and intercept, and also DDoS I mean, the first two solutions that we come out with, we feel very, very good about the trajectory of that type solution base.","We're going to be talking a lot more about this in November, and you'll hear us talking about product additions in that area, I don't want to get into it now, it's not appropriate, but you'll hear us talking about that. But I think it will increase the opportunity in 2017, and also more functionality as well but we think because of our SSL expertise, we are really, really well-positioned to take up the opportunity. Ryan, do you want to mention anything about service chaining and how is that unique capabilities for us.","Ryan Kearny - F5 Networks, Inc.","Sure. Sure. I think, let me just reiterate also, some of the programmability and orchestration capabilities of our product actually from a historical perspective have really landed itself very well to the \u2013 to new environments like NFV and service chaining, et cetera. And we've got a tremendous amount of good kind of response, especially through the quarter with some of those solutions, and we will continue to do so.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, one of the things that I mentioned, that you may have got missed actually was when I talked about one of the examples that use the Cisco Intrusion Prevention product and then there was a sentence after that talking about we've done a number of these collaborative type solutions. I'm talking about working with companies like FireEye and Palo Alto, where we can make those SSL transactions visible to those types of solutions.","Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, hi guys. Just thanks for taking my question. I guess, I had a quick technology question and then maybe a question on the numbers looking into 2017. So, on the tech question, Ryan, there is a lot of people are looking at some of these virtualized ADC guys, and they really like the fact that the software has a very small footprint, it's virtualizable and you guys, I know, you talked about this from time-to-time, but I just wonder if you could update us on where you are with shrinking the footprint of the software, said that it really lends itself to a virtualized environment and automated environment were spinning up new instances of the ADC and so on. So if you could just talk about that and then I'll just follow-up after your answer with the financial questions?","Ryan Kearny - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, no, absolutely. The footprint of software and virtualized ADC functionalities, it's very important now (27:54) to be smaller, more agile, more flexible in these new cloud environments, both public and private cloud. We put a significant amount of investment into this actually over the last few quarters and we'll continue to do so actually.","Including smaller versions within Amazon and more \u2013 smaller versions actually helping us increase the density of these solutions within hardware platforms and stuff like that, it's also not just a smaller footprint, but it's faster boot times. It's easier licensing, it's a more service level APIs for programmability in orchestration. So, in general getting lighter, faster stuff are \u2013 is definitely a part of it, but fitting into these new orchestration environment and increasing capacity and density is also critical. So, it's a big focus area.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","And I'm probably going to say it for the ten times in the call, but again, we'll be giving this in much more detail in November, but yes, smaller \u2013 you'll hear us talk about Microservices, elastic ADC, all that, there is a lot of things coming they have to \u2013 that are very, very cloud friendly.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. As usual we don't have enough patience I guess. And then you guys talked about this mid-30s% operating margin first half of next year and then high-30s% at the end of next year. Can you just walk us through? It looks to us like \u2013 you probably do high-30s% in the first part of the year. And I just \u2013 what's going on with OpEx there, are you planning to \u2013 can you just walk us through the trajectory of OpEx through the year, just that we make sure that we're thinking right on the model?","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. And actually, if you look at the last couple of years, we've given the same sort of guidance rolling into the new fiscal year, where we've said, look we see seasonality in Q1, sometimes rolling into Q2, and then we strengthen in the back half. And historically, when we've tried to maintain operating margin at too consistent of a level throughout the year, it's hurt us, when our primary investment vehicle is head count. And we slow things way down and then try that catch it up again. So, I think it was started in fiscal 2014. We went to this mid-30s% in the first half to allow us to keep investing and then drive strength through the back half on the back of strong revenue, and that's what relying out again for execution for this year.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So we're just seeing normal seasonality on the OpEx as we move through the year then?","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yep.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Exactly.","Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you, guys.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pierre Ferragu with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you for taking my question. Could you give us a bit more details on the how your business is picking up on the cloud, and \u2013 like your virtual additions of your products, so my question will be first, how big is that today for you? And how much or how fast it is growing?","And then, my second question is, how much of your business in the cloud is really like new business coming from new clients and the cloud is for you actually, almost like a new distribution channel, is that allows you to address the market well, not addressing that much before? And how much of that is more like your existing clients using F5 on their own infrastructure, and willing to keep a very similar framework, when they go to the cloud? Thanks.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Right, this is John. This is a pretty broad question in terms of the different areas, because the answer is going to be all of the above in the lot of the questions you talked about, first of all, I mean, when we talked about the three emerging things that are happening that we feel excited about it.","One obviously being asset sale, but the other two are very related to the could where one being, we're seeing customers have this absolute need to have these constant security policies and processes through a hybrid clouds or a public clouds or private, a non-premise environment and that's a big opportunity for us.","And then there's the classic lift and shift capability that we've seen where \u2013 we've seen a very, very, very, almost a 100% successor with the customers lift and shift \u2013 customers lift and shift solution or apps and moved them over. But they want to use a security product, so they want to use iRules. And again, we think that's a big opportunity and we're going to be partnering with Azure and AWS for those types of opportunities. And I'm not going to be specific on numbers.","We've also seen examples with \u2013 for example, our WAF that we prove was on the Azure cloud, I guess a complete new business opportunity. Where we did not let a customer at all. So we've seen that as well. I think that's covering most of all that you asked, that was a pretty broad question, but generally we feel quite good now that this whole mood of this trend is an opportunity after all because of a richness of our software and our security portfolio and our application optimization portfolio.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And the cloud is like a new channel allowing you to address like clients you were not addressing before...?","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","I gave in one of the examples I gave you is a customer that we didn't know, we've not been selling to, buying our WAF solution of Azure.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, okay, sorry. I get it.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","And going forward one of things we're going to be doing is increasing our inside sales organization to basically focus on Silverline and doing more sales that way, which were a lot of that \u2013 by the way a lot of that's new business. And when we see those customers. But also not just Silverline focus on AWS as marketplace as well as Azure as channels.","Pierre C. Ferragu - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Troy Jensen with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, congrats on the nice results, gentleman.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Troy.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So, Andy, maybe for you first here, gross margins ticked up nicely this quarter, I'm assuming that had a lot to do with software, but can you just touch on that? And then I'm looking through product introductions you expect to maybe above or below kind of the corporate margin average.","Andrew Reinland - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. So, really when you look at our margin profile, the gross margin, it was really driven by services. And on a couple of fronts, one we're seeing higher gross margins from our consulting business, efficiencies just overall with technology that we're using for just higher productivity call avoidance those types of things. And then our hiring was a little behind which drove it up as well.","Gross margin on the product side was actually pretty consistent quarter-over-quarter. So in our guidance, you see that we pulled it back a little bit and that's because we'll probably catch up on the hiring side as we drive through Q1.","And then in terms of the profile as it relates to the new product introductions, they are going be pretty consistent, right. We're still in the position that we are able to price to margin and we do that and driving value and we see that consistency in the product margin we've seen for really years.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. And then maybe just a follow-up for you or two part, one here. So, government business was at a record level with respect to revenues and percentage of sales, just curious on what drove that? And then service provider downtick, it looks like it's kind of a seasonal number, but what's your confidence on the service provider vertical?","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","On the Federal business, I mean what we're seeing is bigger and bigger type sales. I mean, so the multimillion dollar sales are pretty common now and just a big opportunity, there's security of course, it's pretty important there. But it's really, I'd call an evolution rather than a revolutionary type increase in the business.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And just on service provider, John?","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","I missed the question, sorry.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","EMEA was down sequentially, it looks like that's seasonal, so the question was just your conviction on the service provider vertical?","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Right. From a revenue perspective, actually sales-wise, it was pretty solid. So the sales, in other words, it was some systems not shipped. I mean 100-gig, we feel very good about that, very good and not just the sales that we made, but where that are being used like in the Gi Firewall, and then more importantly on the pipeline, so we feel very good about that.","And then NFV, I think we're incredibly well-positioned for NFV because of our software portfolio, and of course, we're still working on increasing the throughput to 40-gig and upwards on our VE solution, and I think that's ideal for NFV.","Troy D. Jensen - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Understood, keep up the good work, gentlemen.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Ryan Kearny - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks, Troy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Hutchinson with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.","Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. So I got a question, as I think about the product cycle here, product revenue is down about 5% last year, and this is the most comprehensive product refresh you've had in some time. I don't know if it's bigger than Buffalo Jump, and maybe you could comment on that. I guess what I'm looking for is maybe talking through as we think about this the installed base, and you've touched on it in the past. But just to refresh us, the number of units up for refresh, how ASPs and deal sizes have trended relative to historicals? Any sort of input that we can take to consider and get comfortable that you can indeed grow product revenue this year?","And then, why wouldn't that \u2013 I guess the follow-up to that is just, how \u2013 you're six months into this refresh, and so, or six weeks into this refresh, any sort of color around how things are tracking relative to historical refreshes? Thanks.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. And I'm glad you said that right at the very end you said you are six weeks, that's about right actually in the sense that we only started shipping the products, the high-end portion of the Shuttle series towards the end of the quarter.","So you \u2013 probably three to \u2013 five weeks or six weeks. We've clearly \u2013 we've seen good traction already. And by the way, and the first, it's only recently in the last week or so that we've been training the sales force in this and allowing them to actually push it, but we've taken orders in any event, we're happy with the traction.","We've seen \u2013 remember, it's a high-end product we've announced so far and then the rest of the product line we expect to be done by the end of November. There's just a lot of good reasons for it to be successful. I mean the customer base, as you asked about more than five years is over 40,000, I guess over 42,500 \u2013 44,000 I should say, and that's bigger than it's ever been in the product refresh before. We've got massive amount of systems available now to the sales force to highlight where these customers are, when their service contracts are up, et cetera. So, they've got a lot of ammunition to be able to execute on that refresh. I just think was there any other questions, I think I answered the question.","Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yeah. Just on that installed base, so you said 44,000, I mean how does that compare when you look at metrics and analyze it on the back side, I mean, how does that compare relative to some of the prior...","Ryan Kearny - F5 Networks, Inc.","I think we said last quarter that (39:50) is higher than, it was something more than 60% greater than on our last product cycle, like 63% or 65% higher than last product cycle.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Did you hear that? 65% higher than the last product refresh.","Ryan Hutchinson - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Hello. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. I looked at my notes from last quarter, and there seemed to be great improvement on certain areas. And I want to focus maybe on the North American part. In your prepared remarks, you said that the North America improved, and I'm trying to understand, where did the improvement come from? Because last quarter you reported on hesitancy to close some deals and push outs and migration to cloud as negatives and in this quarter we see the opposite. And I'm trying to understand, if it's an issue of products, maybe something that you have done to your sales organization that you call it execution and anything else that contributed, maybe spending cycles or anything else that's contributed to this improvement in North America, so we can discuss the factors.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, yeah. And sales improved fairly significantly quarter-on-quarter. Sales, I mean, I'm not just talking, I'm not specifically talking revenue and those sales were orders that some shipped in the quarter and some mostly \u2013 some didn't.","But sales increased. I mean a lot of that was execution and I talked about at the beginning of my script that the sales leadership, that John DiLullo has brought into the company including medical (41:37) sales person as well as some real channel expertise. We've added a whole lot of new processes. But one thing you said, Tal, I want to be really clear about, we didn't say the last quarter that we thought the cloud was a headwind. We actually talked about a lot of customer examples showing the opposite where it was a tailwind and what we've seen is that tailwind getting stronger in Q4.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And when you look at the cloud, how does the business model change for existing customers meaning if today you charge certain price on a product and then you have maintenance revenues. What happens when you migrate to the cloud for the same customer? How does it make sense?","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. And that's a complicated question in the sense that depends on the architecture the customer goes for. So, for example, if a customer may move applications that don't have an ADC in front of them, that's an opportunity for us. A customer when he moves applications to, say a public cloud, may want to do more horizontal scaling because it's a software that type shift and that's an opportunity. In fact we've talked about that before, when we see the eType (42:49) solution, we tend to see as much revenue because there is no vertical scalability, it's horizontal.","And other words, instead of a (42:58) sitting in front of 100 apps, you have one app, one image per or VE per app. So, it's quite a complicated scenario, but we feel good about it. Everything we've seen that tells it's an opportunity.","The other thing we can talk about when we do that is adding security. Security when you move to the cloud is critical. So the chance that was adding more functionality from a module perspective is also good.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Just last follow-up, any update on new CEO, are you \u2013 you said in the past about, it will take you three months to six months. I think we're coming to the six months anniversary, any update?","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. We started the process talent in July, at the end of \u2013 towards the end of July actually. So we're not really at the end. We've got the search committee from the board, specific search committee of board members are working in this. We've actually done some interviews, the search committee and the team are being very, very thorough about this. There is no timescales yet, we're not giving \u2013 there's no timescales associated with it. And the main focus of the team in this room is on the business.","Tal Liani - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Dougherty & Company. Your line is open.","Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Yes, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Could you give us some more detail on how you're doing with the service provider segment in the different regions and what would be \u2013 you did talk a bit about the 100-gig blade but what are some of the other used-case applications that are more popular with F5 today as opposed to maybe a year or two years ago when we thought a lot of the activity would come from the diameter. Thanks.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. There's two big areas the way I view it and if anybody wants to chip in, that's fine, but basically on the one hand we have the NFV and that moved a whole range of software and orchestration in management that we brought to the market in fiscal 2016 that helped us dramatically and we talked about speeding up the VE performance as well. That's one hand. And then on the other hand, we've got the Gi line. In the Gi line, you've got Gi Firewall, you get traffic steering, CGNAT, and that's a consolidation play. There's a big consolidation play there. And then the other thing to think about is, obviously is something we're talking about in the cloud applies to the service provider space and so does SSL. The increase of SSL traffic is also a big opportunity in service provider.","Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC","Okay. And one follow on question, last Friday, we had this huge DDoS attack domestically and can you talk to whatever you can on how well your DDoS product is doing? Thanks.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we've had some really, really powerful examples of \u2013 and obviously not going to name the customers here of mitigating very, very large DDoS attacks and we've done it pretty successfully. Obviously, we have an on-premise DDoS capability. I am really talking about Silverline for the really big attack.","Over time, we're going to introduce signaling in DDoS, which I think is going to be incredibly powerful that allows us to if we see some sort of a signature type thing happening on our on-premise solution where we have an \u2013 you know the size of an installed base and we can actually upload that to a Silverline as a service solution and then other customers got access to it, I think that's incredibly powerful. We've done extremely well. I mean, something, I can't go through the details in terms of the gigs, but it was just high as you've seen in some of the more public examples.","Catharine A. Trebnick - Dougherty & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. I had a question about the refreshing, the opportunity around the security bundling. John, you are looking to introduce any kind of special programs to, you can increase your security dollars as you refresh some of your core ADC installed base customers?","Ben Gibson - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, sure. Hey, this is Ben Gibson on this one. We're definitely looking to both continue, the good, better, best smart bundling initiative that we've had in place. But we see a good opportunity to expand on that in the few different areas. And I think the key is, not only for security attached the integrated ADC system but also the opportunity to do the next few quarters to attack new buyers and budgets. So, it's not only security attached in terms of product but I think what's really interesting to coming you is, security attached to new security buyer and budgets within same account. And as the portfolio continues to expand on that front, we think there's some interesting opportunities there.","Alex Kurtz - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","John Eldridge - F5 Networks, Inc.","Okay, Vince. We are going to take two more calls, then wrap it up.","Operator","That's noted, sir. And our next question comes from George Notter with Jefferies. Your line is open.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Hi, thanks a lot. I wanted to follow-up on the product refresh questions. I think if we go back a few months ago there were some open questions about whether or not you'd see a wait for effects from customers kind of holding off for the new product deliveries. I'm wondering if you've indeed seen any of that or you expect to see any of that in the December quarter?","And then also I wanted to ask about evidence of customers trading down, obviously the refresh gives customers access to products that have significantly more performance it, similar types of prices and guess some \u2013 I'm wondering if people are looking to trade down? So thanks.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah. On the Osborne question, it's the delay question. First of all that you have to say sometimes you don't see this, right, so sometimes you don't see it. I don't think we had anything, any material slowdown in last quarter, I don't think we saw that. We didn't actually start shipping until the end, so in fact, the new products, but pretty immaterial to the results last quarter. And we expect them to be more material this quarter.","In terms of this quarter and the delay, yeah, there is no signs of that yet, but I think we do a lot of mitigating to make sure we watch it like a hawk in December because December is obviously when we have the whole product range announced, but I think we've got that managed reasonably well but we'll see what happens there.","The other thing is that from a trading down perspective, interest of note \u2013 this is dangerous almost we're saying this because there is not much data, because it's only a few weeks we've been shipping the product, we've actually not seen quite a high interest at the very high-end model right now, that's probably going to change when we have the whole range available with us \u2013 that's what we've seen so far.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then just a follow-up on, on the Osborne effect idea, are you guys modeling for any of that in the December quarter in that guide?","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Oh! Yeah, we always assume that type, yes is yes. The other thing I was just thinking about on it is that one of the things is very, very a big increase that we've got from a performance perspective with a new product refresh is SSL, you had me going on and on of SSL and I know that feels very excited about it, but that would have been \u2013 we're going to bring more performance with Shuttle there and that could mitigate any Osborne effect as well. And also it's going to be the first ADC with ECC encryption available. So we're going to have quite competitive advantage as well.","George C. Notter - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.","James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you so much for the detail so far on the conference call. I have one question and a clarification question. If you look ahead on your guidance, which is quite encouraging. Is it fair to assume that we're now turning the corner that your product growth year-over-year with all your launches and comps and stuff how it's going (51:19) to turn positive or is there any type of variability, I should think about as we kind of look ahead because it appears like, we'd now be at a point where turning positive products growth year-over-year.","And then the clarification question is, have you had any component shortages or any gating factors that we should be mindful of that either A, impact shipping times or B, potentially margins or costs on your side. Thank you.","John McAdam - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yeah, regarding the product revenue goal, I mean I think if you go back and look at what I said in my opening remarks is that our goal is to be just product revenue growth throughout the year. And I didn't say that in January, I can assure you. So, yes I think there is improvement there. In terms of the product shortage, Julian.","Edward Julian Eames - F5 Networks, Inc.","Yes, sir. This is Julian. Now, obviously it's new product introduction and you're using some old suppliers and some new ones, but we've not seen anything abnormal to the normal ebbs-and-flows that you'd see within the supply chain.","James D.

Thank you for joining us today. I will talk briefly to our business drivers before handing over to Frank to review the quarter's results in detail.","We have been investing to evolve our business to better meet our customer's changing application demands. Today we are delivering our world-class application services across a wider range of deployment and consumption models. As a result, customers are increasingly deploying F5 in multi-cloud environments, driving a shift in our revenue mix towards software. Customer demand for consistent application security and reliable application performance drove 5% total revenue growth in our first quarter. Strong customer demand for security use cases, including WAF and SSLO [ph], as well as ongoing ELA traction fueled our 50% software growth. We are very pleased with our continued software traction. We continue to expect 60% to 70% software growth for 2020, including contribution from Shape Security, which closed on Friday last week. Our software growth was partially offset by our systems business, which was down 11% as customers increasingly look to consume F5 Solutions as software.","Our services business was very strong in the quarter, delivering 8% revenue growth. Services is benefiting from our robust software sales over the last several quarters, including the second full quarter of NGINX-related sales. Overall, we continue to execute well against our long-term strategy and are pleased by the pace of our continued transition to a software-driven business.","I will speak more to our business dynamics and customer wins after Frank reviews the quarter's financial results and our Q2 outlook. Frank?","Frank Pelzer","Thank you, Fran\u00e7ois, and good afternoon everyone. As Fran\u00e7ois noted, we delivered another quarter of strong revenue growth. First quarter revenue of $569.3 million was up approximately 5% year-over-year and near the top-end of our guided range of $560 million to $570 million.","GAAP net income for the quarter was $98.5 million or $1.62 per share. Non-GAAP net income was $155.4 million or $2.55 per share. This was well above the top-end of our guidance range due to our strong revenue performance as well as disciplined operating expense management in the quarter.","Q1 product revenue of $235 million was flat year-over-year and accounted for approximately 41% of total revenue. As Fran\u00e7ois mentioned, software revenue grew 50% year-over-year. Software represented approximately 28% of product revenue in Q1, up from approximately 19% in the year ago quarter. We continue to experience strong uptake on our software solution sold as annual subscriptions, including as ELAs. In fact, contribution from ELAs increased again year-over-year.","Systems revenue of $170 million was down 11% year-over-year as customers continue to transition to software-based solutions. Systems accounted for approximately 72% of product revenue in the quarter. Services revenue of $335 million grew 8% year-over-year, and represented approximately 59% of total revenue. There were three primary contributors to services revenue strong performance in the quarter. The primary factor is improvements to the tools and processes our team uses to identify and secure renewals. In addition, we continue to enjoy healthy services attached in renewal rates to software sold as perpetual or as subscriptions, including NGINX-related sales, and we have also seen a step-up in consulting services demand associated with growing software sales.","On a regional basis, in Q1, America has delivered a solid quarter with 3% revenue growth year-over-year, representing 53% of total revenue. EMEA grew 5% and accounted for 27% of revenue, while APAC grew 8% and accounted for 20% of revenue. Looking at our bookings by vertical, enterprise customers represented 65% of product bookings and service providers accounted for 16%. Our government business was very strong, representing 19% of product bookings, including 7% from U.S. Federal. In Q1, we had three greater than 10% distributors, Ingram Micro, which accounted for 16% of total revenue, Westcon, which accounted for 11%, and Arrow, which accounted for 10%.","Let's now discuss Q1 operating results. GAAP gross margin in Q1 was at 84.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 86%. GAAP operating expenses were $358 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $297 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were at the lower-end of our guidance range for several reasons, including disciplined expense management, and sales commissions back in line with historical levels, down from the highs of the second-half of 2019. In addition, there were some timing differences for expenses expected between Q1 and Q2. Our GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 21.5%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.8%. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 21.4%.","Turning to the balance sheet, in Q1, we generated $144 million in cash flow from operations. This is down from last year for several reasons, including lower year-over-year operating margins, commission payments from strong Q4 bookings, M&A related expenses, and restructuring. Cash and investments totaled approximately $1.5 billion at quarter end. DSO of 56 days and capital expenditures for the quarter were $22 million. Deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. The growth rate is down from 2019 levels, because we had lapped our 606 adoption, which as we consistently called out was accounting for roughly half our deferred revenue growth over the last year.","We ended the quarter with approximately 5,305 employees, down approximately 20 from Q4 as a result of ongoing efforts to better align spend with strategic imperatives. We continue to view cash as a strategic asset for our future growth. Our near-term priority will be paying down the $400 million term loan A related to the Shape acquisition funding. We will look to balance that with rebuilding our cash position for strategic purposes. We also may opt to repurchase shares during any open trading window.","Now, let me share our guidance for fiscal Q2 of 2020. Unless otherwise stated, please note that my guidance comments reference non-GAAP operating metrics. In addition, with the Shape Security acquisition closed on January 24, our guidance is inclusive of Shape. We continue to make strong progress transitioning our business to a software-driven model. We remain confident in our position in the market, and expect increasing demand for our multi-cloud application services will continue to drive revenue growth. We also expect continued strong demand for our software solutions. In fact, in Q2, we anticipate software growth will reaccelerate above Q1's 50% growth, even before any contribution from Shape.","As we noted when we announced the Shape acquisition, Shape has a subscription revenue software model with a significant deferred revenue balance. Purchase accounting will impact Shape-related recognized revenue on a GAAP basis, principally over the next four quarters. Therefore, for that period, we will provide non-GAAP revenue guidance, which excludes the impact of the purchase accounting write-down. We believe non-GAAP revenue will provide a better reflection of our ongoing business results. We will report revenue on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis during this timeframe.","With this in mind, we are targeting Q2 '20 non-GAAP revenue in the range of $580 million to $590 million. In addition, we expect services Q2 '20 annual revenue growth more in line with Q4 of '19. We expect gross margins in the range of 85% to 85.5%. We estimate operating expenses of $325 million to $337 million in Q2, reflecting the addition of Shape, and the opportunity we have to invest in scale of that business. We anticipate our effective tax rate for Q2 will remain in the 21% to 22% range. Our Q2 earnings target is $2.14 to $2.17 per share. In the quarter, we expect share-based compensation expense of approximately $52 million to $53 million.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Fran\u00e7ois. Fran\u00e7ois?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Frank. I am going to begin today with a spotlight on NGINX before highlighting some of the broader trends and customer wins in the quarter. First, today we announced an important milestone for the combine F5 and NGINX, the availability of Controller 3.0. Controller is our orchestration and analytics solution for NGINX. It simplifies how enterprises manage, monitor, and automate large scale NGINX deployments.","Prior to the acquisition of NGINX, F5 was working on a cloud-native virtual ADC offering that featured an application-centric design. We expected the solution appropriately named cloud-native would set a new benchmark for how modern developer teams can deliver new apps to markets faster. Immediately after the close of the NGINX acquisition in May 2019, we merged the F5 team working on our cloud-native project with the NGINX controller development team. Today, as we begin only our third quarter as a combined team, we are very excited to release the converged F5-NGINX solution, NGINX Controller 3.0. This controller brings together the best of NGINX Controller 1.0 and 2.0, and adds the application-centric design and enterprise features pioneered by F5.","For context on why this new approach is so important, we first need to emphasize the fundamental shift in the way our customers manage and deliver applications. Originally, there was a divide between the application teams that develop the code and the operations team that release and manage the finished application. DevOps evolved to bridge this divide, and many organizations embraced DevOps practices to deploy applications faster. As a result, organizations embraced software like NGINX Open Source and NGINX Plus to empower developers with control over their own infrastructure. Although this improved developer productivity, it also created Shadow IT. Many of these developers worked outside of IT, outside of the compliance and enterprise security requirements designed to protect applications and data. That is why we believe Controller 3.0 and its application-centric approach is highly differentiated. The application-centric design introduces a new self service portal, configuration API, application reporting and analytics, and built-in security capabilities. These combined app-centric capabilities empower developers from a centralized solution that maintains control and compliance for security and operations teams.","Controller 3.0 shifts the center of gravity from the instance of infrastructure supporting the app, so the application itself. With role based access spanning AppDev, DevOps, SecOps, and NetOps, it enables deployment of a consistent set of multi-cloud application services across the application lifecycle. This enables different users to manage the tasks relevant to their role. In summary, we expect the availability of Controller 3.0 will be an accelerator for our NGINX business for three reasons.","First, it expands the addressable market for NGINX to include adjacent app services in security and service mesh; ","second, it increases the average deal size by making large scale NGINX deployments easier to orchestrate; and third, it introduces new commercial capabilities that are attractive to NGINX's large open source base. Early feedback has been positive with customers noting that Controller 3.0 expands the number of use cases and deployments of NGINX particularly for Kubernetes Ingress and API Management. In addition to delivering the Controller 3.0 release, NGINX had its strongest quarter yet in Q1 with the team hitting all of its significant integration and value creation milestones.","When we look at the future of F5, we're more confident now than ever before that NGINX will be a meaningful software growth driver. We continue to see evidence that NGINX is expanding our overall footprint and allowing us to serve new applications. This includes enabling application services consumption in native container environments. As an example, during Q1, we secured an NGINX Plus and NGINX Controller win with a new customer, a large Australian mining company, the customer was looking to modernize a legacy business process at its mine sites where a single failure could result in up to $4 million in productivity losses.","By using NGINX for the API and Kubernetes in their applications, they now are able to collect and deliver over 30 different metrics. As a result, they're better able to ensure the speedy and reliable delivery of raw materials to their destinations. We're also seeing an uptick for NGINX inclusion in ELAs both in concert with F5 Solutions and on a standalone basis. During Q1, we closed our first 100% NGINX ELA with a large streaming services provider.","NGINX Plus is enabling seamless capacity and service offering increases without disrupting critical revenue producing applications. The ELA construct was meaningful in this case, because the customer is able to deploy additional NGINX Plus instances as subscribers increase. In fact, when the actual number of subscribers surpassed forecasts out of the gate, the ELA provided the customer with the flexibility to immediately scale services with demand. Beyond NGINX, we continue to gain traction in software across the other growth drivers we have consistently highlighted, including ELA's service provider use cases, security use cases and deployments across multi-cloud environments.","I will highlight customer examples of each of these in Q1. In fact, the first example highlights an ELA win with a large U.K. based telecommunications provider transitioning from hardware to software. In this case, the customers ADC infrastructure based on F5 hardware was nearing end-of-life. The need to refresh provided the customer with the opportunity to rethink the design and build a flexible virtualized environment aligned to its future business needs. Despite a competitor touting analytics and commercial flexibility, F5 was able to demonstrate best-in-class software based security and ADC capabilities. In addition, our analytics and reporting outperformed the competition and reduced the customers' operational costs.","Looking at a security use case win in the quarter, during Q1, we secured a combined systems and software win with a German Health System company, F5 is providing Application Security Solutions including Advanced WAF to secure a platform that allows doctors, hospitals and health insurance companies consolidated access to patient records. Of note, we were the only provider able to meet the customers' security requirements of delivering a highly secure and scalable infrastructure that met stringent government standards.","In an example of F5 Solutions deployed in multi-cloud environments, we secured a win with one of the U.K's most trusted financial brands, a large U.K. based mortgage provider. As part of their digital transformation program, they chose to deploy big IP virtual additions across two public clouds. This provided the growth capability to support an ever increasing number of online banking customers and enabled consistent application services and security across the cloud and data center.","Before we move to Q&A, let me say how very enthusiastic we are to begin our integration work with our colleagues from Shape Security. To recap briefly, we believe the combination of F5 and Shape changes the game in application security. Shape is the leader in anti-fraud and abuse protection, solving a mission critical problem for large enterprises. Together with F5's world-class portfolio of application services, Shape and F5 will deliver the most comprehensive Application Security portfolio available. Beyond accelerating our growth momentum and more than doubling our addressable security market, Shape's machine learning and AI powered capabilities also will scale and extend F5's broad portfolio of application services.","With Shape, we will expand our ability to optimize and protect customers' applications in an increasingly complex multi-cloud world. With the Shape transaction closing last week, the teams already have begun the integration process led by members of our Chief Strategy Officer, Tom Fountain's team under our value creation program. This is the same team that executed the very successful integration of NGINX and we're confident they will do the same with Shape leveraging lessons learned during the NGINX process.","We're very pleased that Derek Smith, Shape's CEO will continue to lead the team as part of F5. In closing, digital transformation has changed the competitive stakes for nearly every business on the planet. Beyond delivering a compelling, reliable user experience, customers need partners and solutions that allow them to do more and move faster.","At F5, we envision a future where all businesses can deploy new applications, or make changes to existing applications in minutes, not days. We're transforming F5 to make that vision a reality for our customers to enable, support, and secure every application across any environment with a consistent set of enterprise grade services; my sincere thanks to the entire F5 team for driving another great quarter, my thanks also to our partners, our customers and our shareholders for joining us on our journey. I'll remind you that our Analyst and Investor Day is scheduled for March 3rd in New York. We look forward to seeing many of you there.","With that, Operator, we will now open the call to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open.","Tim Long","Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, Frank, I think you talked about last time the cloud-related businesses, which are still in early phase were a meaningful portion of the total software revenues, could you just give us an update on how the cloud vertical did for you, and did you see some sequential growth there, and if not, were there ELA impacts or some other impacts? And then secondly, the services strength, it sounds like the year-over-year growth rate will tick back a little bit next quarter, but could you just talk looking out the next several quarters or year, should that line start to become under a little bit more pressure as the weight of the system revenue declines hits the longer term model? Thank you.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Hey, Tim, it's Fran\u00e7ois. I'll take the first question and then Frank will comment on the services question. On cloud revenues, Tim, we said last [technical difficulty] theyrepresented a meaningful portion of our total software revenues, and that portion continues to grow without cloud. Our business is growing even faster than our overall software business, and that's driven by a couple of things. One is, we have made our core solutions much easier to deploy in cloud environments with integrations with essentially all the large public cloud providers. We have added some automation and orchestration capabilities to enable our customers to include our solutions in automation environment, and then in their CICD development pipelines, much easier than that in the past. And third, I think we're continuing to see just significant growth in the marketplaces of the large public cloud providers, where our solutions are also available for purchase on a utility basis.","So, when you look at the consumption models that we've enabled by both the technology and the commercial models that we've enabled, they've significantly reduced or eliminated any friction associated with using F5 in public clouds. Our ELAs are a good example of that, where customers buy an agreement for three years, and then they can deploy licenses in any environment, including in public clouds and port licenses from one public cloud to the other or one public cloud to back to on-prem.","So, all of that leads to a growth in our cloud software revenue, which I think we said in the last quarter or in the six months of 2019 when we had growth in our software business of 90% for Q3 and Q4, that our cloud business had grown even faster than that, and it continues to be on a very strong growth trend.","Frank Pelzer","And Tim, in relation to the services revenue, obviously, we were really pleased with having 8% year-over-year growth in Q1. That was obviously above what we had guided to the last time we talked about the service revenue components, which was all the way back at AIM [ph] of 2018, when we talked about mid-to-low growth during the Horizon One timeframe. So, this is great performance to see.","What we're seeing actually is also an increase in the attach rates across all the cohorts of age contracts, and so, it's not really from our perspective, any decline in hardware that is impacting over a longer period of time, the decrease in the services revenue business, what it actually is more of the mix of things that come through as subscription, where that subscription looks more like a SaaS subscription, and a lot of that revenue gets recognized, almost all that revenue gets recognized in the product side and not the services side, and so, we continue to see strong growth in the services revenue, probably even above where we thought when we thought about this in March of 2018, but over a longer period of time, we do see those services revenues coming down in terms of growth rates, but that's really more of a mix issue than anything to do with a systems versus a software sale.","Tim Long","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.","James Fish","Hey, guys, thanks for the question here. If I can squeeze into as well, you know, enterprise still grew about 5% this quarter, yet the industry not everyone is seeing that kind of strength. I guess can you guys just go into what's going on in enterprise specifically that is showing that resiliency? Thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Hi, James, thanks for the question. Generally on the enterprise, we continue to see spending patterns that are -- we are going to call them relatively healthy in [technical difficulty] healthy as they were in 2018, but we haven't seen a change overall from the spending patterns that we saw in 2019. So, we seem to continue on that trend. There are some changes or variations by geography, and as you know, we pointed several times that we were seeing soft test in Europe and in the U.K. and DACH in particular, and I think we continue to see that today, but overall, the spending patterns are healthy. When you look, by the way, it's your context is that of other perhaps providers in infrastructure of data centers. What we're seeing more and more, James is the spending with us is tied to applications, and the growth of applications not tied to data center infrastructure per se. So, perhaps over time, you'll see more and more of that difference, but the spending patterns I relate to is what we see with our customers application projects.","James Fish","Got it, and just a follow-up on that, I mean, it was a slight miss on what we were all expecting on products for the quarter, were there any pause in orders ahead of the combined NGINX Plus F5 Controller, and why do you expect unattached software to accelerate next quarter?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Jim, that's two separate questions. I will start with the first one on product revenue growth. Product revenue growth was flat, and indeed it could have been a little better than that. What we saw in Q1, I think there were really a couple of factors in Q1; one is, there was some lumpiness in some large deals that we expected. In Q1, we also did a relatively important realignment of our North America sales organization, in part to prepare to better focus on certain verticals, and to also evolve the alignment of our teams, given the evolution that's going on in our portfolio with the new SaaS solution, NGINX coming in, Shape coming in, and I think that realignment caused a bit of a short-term pause on momentum. It's also for the better, and we'll see the benefits of that for the rest of the year. So, I think those were two of the factors specifically on product revenue growth. Your second question about why we expect strong revenue growth in Q2 for software specifically, I think this issue of large deal lumpiness does apply also to large software deals, and we have a very robust pipeline of software deals going into Q2, and so, we're pretty confident that we'll see a very strong growth in Q2.","James Fish","Thanks, guys.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Sami Badri","Hi, thank you. I wanted to touch up on the percentage of enterprise wins that are tied more to security use cases versus more of the legacy business, or I guess you would say more ADC like product sales. So, just trying to understand has the security for your customers shifted even further to the forefront of their decision-making, or would you say it's very comparable to how it was over the last year or so? Just trying to understand, has there been a big shift forward in terms of points of security use cases?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Sami. Even though we don't -- today we don't break out our security revenues specifically. We continue to see strong growth in our security business, and I said before, we see more growth in our security business than the rest of the portfolio. And so, the answer to your question is, yes, we continue to see more and more of our deals driven by security use cases. In a lot of cases, these deals also pull other application services that you would classify more as application delivery services, but increasingly in a meaningful portion of our business, security is the use case that actually pulls the deal together.","The second factor that kind of accelerates that trend, if you will, is that in multi-cloud environments, we are seeing double the security attach rate to our solutions that we are seeing on-prem, and so, given that more and more, our business is becoming multi-cloud in terms of the deployment, we are seeing an increase of our security business, and all of that by the way, we expect to see that accelerate with Shape, and the synergies that we expect to drive between the Shape portfolio and the F5 portfolio.","Sami Badri","Got it, thank you. And then, I kind of just want to touch back onto the services growth rate that you saw in the quarter, obviously 8% is a positive surprise for most people looking at your model. And you identified three factors for what's driving that, one of them was new tools. So, given that this just played out in this quarter, should we expect similar high single-digit growth, or even in the same ballpark of growth and services for the rest of the year as these three factors continue to drive the business forward and continue to drive more services renewals, or should we expect like a moderation on the growth rate?","Frank Pelzer","Jamie, I think we gave some fairly specific guidance for Q2 in particular, that probably gets you to a number that Tim was getting to, which is slightly down from where we printed Q1, but still very healthy in terms of the growth rate for Q2. As we look out over the course of the year, that services growth rate may start to modulate down particularly as we get more and more traction with some of the pure SaaS type revenue models that we discussed, but I think it's safe to say that the overall services growth rate is going to be higher than probably what we thought about at the end of our Horizon One guidance when we talked about this in March of 2018.","Sami Badri","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Samik Chatterjee","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Fran\u00e7ois, if I can just start off with the more longer term question, I mean, you've been making investments both organic as well as in organic since you kind of took over and have been aligning the company to growth areas. Now, as you think about the transformation, can you kind of help us think about which innings you're in, given that Frank's commented to prioritizing debt pay down seem to indicate you're kind of done with most of the heavy lifting in terms of the transformation that you envisioned?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Samik. Well, let me start with what's driving this transformation. So, I think we have a belief, so if you look at, us versus other players in the industry, we have a very strategic position, and that we are in line of the traffic between application and users for a very, very large number of applications. And with the acquisition of NGINX, we extended our reach very significantly, and we're not part of the flow for real hundred million applications. Our belief is simply driven by the fact that the number and complexities of applications in the future is going to increase and increase exponentially from where we are, given everybody this whole transformations, and as a result, we have an opportunity to extend that strategic position to more applications, and also intensify more applications, more application services for these applications, and that's really what we have been doing with this transformation, our priorities to do it organically, but when in the selective scenarios where we see an opportunity to accelerate that unification, for within a window of time, we have decided to do that inorganically, and you've seen two instances of that. Where we are in this translation, I would say, we are in the early innings, because we think we are actually in the very early innings of the digital transformation of our customers. So, I expect that the growth opportunity for F5 as we succeed in unifying these application services for this new multi-cloud environment is well ahead of us, and is very significant","Samik Chatterjee","Got it. And if I can quickly follow-up for Frank, Frank how should we think about the trajectory for OpEx beyond 2Q's level? I think you said $325 to $337, so, on beyond that how should we be thinking about the trajectory?","Frank Pelzer","Yes. Samik, we just go back to what I said, pre the Shape acquisition, in terms of Q2 is always our seasonal low point in the OpEx cycle, and we intend to tick up in Q3 and Q4. In terms of operating margin expansion, we still feel very comfortable with the guidance that we put out for the year of 30 to 32 for the year, and so, directionally, I think Q2 will be the low point and then we're going to back up from there in Q3 and Q4.","Samik Chatterjee","Okay, thank you. Thanks for clarifying.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen. Your line is open. Paul Silverstein your line is open.","Your next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Rod Hall","Yes. Hi, guys. I just wanted to ask a couple things on the Shape acquisition. You guys call out these non-GAAP adjustments to revenue, and I wanted to just come back to those -- I'm not sure I fully understand that. So, maybe if you could go back into a little bit more detail on exactly what that is? And then I wanted to -- also on Shape, just ask -- and maybe you said this earlier, but what was the contribution, or what is the contribution of Shape to the guidance? It seems like -- I think you guys have said there was an IRR of $70 million growing at 50%, and kind of if I do some rough math on that, I get to $5 million as maybe revenue contribution, maybe it's less than that, maybe more, but I'm just trying to get some idea of what's in the guidance from Shape? Thanks.","Frank Pelzer","Sure, Rod. So, we are not specifically actually breaking out guidance for Shape. The reason why we did that with NGINX is because NGINX actually closed after we had given guidance, and so, when we reported NGINX, we tried to be specific on what was the relationship of our recognized revenue versus what we have guided to, and then the contribution from NGINX, but with Shape we've got it with it, and we're not breaking that out at this time.","In terms of what we said and what Fran\u00e7ois talked about when we actually announced the Shape acquisition and the non-GAAP revenue, with a SaaS based business model, and you see this quite frequently, in software, SaaS land where companies acquire with -- companies with a very large deferred revenue balance, given the way revenue comes into those SaaS models, where there's a significant write-down in that revenue as part of purchase accounting. And so, to try to give the users of our financial statements a better sense for what the long-term growth rate is going to be as opposed to a muted revenue, we're going to be reporting both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue to give better compatibility in years to come.","Rod Hall","And, Frank, just one other thing to clarify, you guys said that services would grow at about the same rate, so I guess like 6%, and that including Shape looks to me like it drops out about $260 million of product revenue in the guided quarter, I mean is that a correct way to look at that?","Frank Pelzer","That number isn't exactly what is familiar to me, but I think it's not so far off. I think the rate we had probably for Q4 last time was I think 6 to 6.5.","Rod Hall","Yes, 6.3.","Frank Pelzer","Yes [Multiple speakers]\u2026","Rod Hall","So, you're thinking almost exactly that growth rate?","Frank Pelzer","Yes.","Rod Hall","Okay.","Frank Pelzer","There is no services revenue for Shape.","Rod Hall","Right, okay, yeah, thank you, Frank. That's helpful too. Thanks.","Frank Pelzer","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Fahad Najam with Cowen. Your line is open.","Fahad Najam","Thank you for taking my question. I'm trying to also understand the software revenue transfer. In terms of your software revenue, can you help us understand how much of it is recurring and how much is ELA?","Frank Pelzer","So, we really have to split that out in the past.","Fahad Najam","In terms of -- is it reasonable to assume that majority of your software revenue is still coming from ELAs?","Frank Pelzer","No, it's not. When we take a look, I think I think we talked about a few quarters ago, the pure percentage of recurring revenue of our total revenue was 60% plus, and we continue to build, and that's exactly what we saw in Q1.","Fahad Najam","Okay. And then if I may ask one more question on regarding to Shape Security, if we assume that almost all of Shape Security is security revenue, would you be breaking out your security revenue as a standalone now that Shape is closed?","Frank Pelzer","We don't anticipate doing that at this time, Fahad, but we're talking about several different KPI metrics for AIM in March and TBD on what we decide there.","Fahad Najam","All right, thank you for my questions.","Frank Pelzer","Sure. Thanks, Fahad.","Operator","Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.","Lexi Curnin","Hi, thank you for taking the question. This is Lexi on for Amit. So, I guess what we're wondering about is when we're looking at the 60% to 70% growth in software moving forward, how much of that is organic versus M&A-driven? And then on the organic side, what are the top two or three contributors to that growth?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Well, let me start with, as you know, we're not breaking out Shape and NGINX versus the F5 business prior to Shape and NGINX, but let me give you some indicators. Last year, the F5 software grew about 60% year-on-year. There was a very small contribution of NGINX in the second-half of the year to that growth. We guided after the NGINX acquisition to growth in software in our Horizon One which includes 2020, that was 35% to 40%. As you can see, we're well above that. We were at 60% for the full-year last year, 90% in the second-half, and we're at 50% this quarter. So, this just gives you a sense that the growth in -- I am going to call it F5 traditional software prior to even NGINX and Shape is very significant, and that's driven by a few things. It's driven by the work that we've done on making our software easier to consume in private clouds and automated environments is driven by the work that we've done in putting our software in public clouds, and it's driven by the work we've done in enabling new consumption models, ELA, subscriptions, utilities, et cetera in all environment. And that's -- the F5 was done, but it's also as a primary driver coming from our customer's desire to move from sort of hardware first postures to software first postures and seeing that change in our customers, both in enterprise and in the service provider world as service providers start more and more virtualizing their infrastructure, but there are very strong demand drivers from our customers to move to a software consumption of F5. When you look at 2020, we do expect strong contribution from NGINX and from Shape to achieve or exceed our 60% to 70% guidance.","Frank Pelzer","Lexi, the only thing I'd add is that we did say during the prepared remarks that even without Shape, we did expect Q2 software growth to be above the 50% level that we experienced in Q1.","Lexi Curnin","Great, thank you very much.","Frank Pelzer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham. Your line is open.","Alex Henderson","Great, thank you very much. I was hoping if you could talk a little bit about the NGINX acquisition relative to the selling process and the new products that you're introducing here. So as I understand it, the value of NGINX is predominantly in selling to application coders and DevOps people that generally focused on an application specific project and have had little success selling the controller because that's generally sold back to NetOps and IT administration. Conversely, your historical footprint that F5 has predominantly been selling into the NetOps and IT stuff but you didn't have really good access to the coding community, DevOps community. As you've introduced this 3.0 and are now bringing that back through the F5 distribution architecture, are you going to then integrate that into Beacon and then have the full-value of the controls from the Big IP through the NGINX Controller to centrally manage the people who are in the DevOps, the DevOps\/Coder community, does that bring power back to the NetOps people in a way that they've been losing in the past? Can you talk a little bit about that dynamic?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes, thank you, Alex. The short answer to all this is yes. But let me give you a bit of context. If you look at where NGINX had gotten traction in terms of revenue is really offering their data plane above the open source capabilities in the data plane offering additional features in the data plane, and as well as support and that's really how NGINX so far in the current model had monetized their technology. The Controller hold new dimension to that, to the DevOps community because number one, it makes it a lot easier to deploy and manage large scale implementations of NGINX data planes across a number of applications. And so, if you look at the folks who really to-date have been able to use NGINX, it's folks who are very sophisticated DevOps people and have the skills and expertise to integrate these deployments and manage them on their own. And so, with the Controller, it offers essentially an easy button that allows a much larger group of people that perhaps don't have the same sophistication to now use NGINX technology and use that technology on a large scale.","So that's kind of the first driver, the Controller also integrates application centric design which really is targeted at more of the enterprise users including what we call Super-NetOps users in large enterprises. And so it does, it does gives an ability for the NetOps people to still have visibility of what goes on in the infrastructure under their applications and the DevOps people to have a self service model to deploy their applications faster and make changes for applications very quickly. So we at the time of the acquisitions, we said that F5 and NGINX together we're going to bridge the divide between NetOps and DevOps and the Controller holds really the manifestation of that strategy, and it's really the first offer in the markets that truly bridges the divide, and allow these two communities to work in concert serving the needs for speed of DevOps and serving the needs for visibility and compliance from the NetOps people. This Controller will indeed integrate in a technological Beacon, which will give visibility and analytics across all F5 environments, NGINX, Big IP, and other environments. So that's the convergence. We think this is a very important launch for our NGINX business because in addition to the capabilities around DevOps and bridging the divide, it also does increase the deal size for NGINX products because it makes large scale deployments easier and it offer new and exciting capabilities for a number of open source users that may want to move up a tier and use the Controller as a commercial technology.","Alex Henderson","Great, thank you very much. That's pretty clear.","Operator","Your next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open.","Victor Chiu","Hi, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. Can you just give us an update on where the Telcos stand regarding the shift to software implementations of ADC and kind of the outlook there?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Hi, Simon. We're continuing to see an acceleration in Telcos starting to move to virtualization. We saw a couple of large deals again in that space this quarter with large service providers and this is driven by essentially readiness for 5G and also the desire for service providers to be able to move faster when they need to make changes to their infrastructure and overall be able to reduce their costs. What we're seeing for now is service providers kind of keeping their more hardware based infrastructure in place and starting kind of Greenfield software implementations for virtualization. Over the long time, I think these will converge, but for now those we see in the service providers that we work with, we see these as two separate environments for the time being. Overall the trend is accelerating.","Victor Chiu","It's helpful, thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from Jeff Kvaal with Instinet. Your line is open. Jeff Kvaal, your line is open.","Your final question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Meta Marshall","Look at there; I get the benefit from Jeff. Quick question on AWS partnership, just any update there that you could give? And then I assume because you revalidated the 32% to 33% operating margin target, but just on the mid to high single-digit dilution target and kind of breakeven on 24 months for Shape Security, have any of those expectations changed? That's it. Thanks.","Frank Pelzer","Meta, I just want to be clear when we talked about 30% to 32% operating margin\u2026","Meta Marshall","Sorry, 30% to 32%, yes, yes.","Frank Pelzer","Just want to make sure that we're clear on the numbers, like go ahead, Fran\u00e7ois, if you want to talk about AWS?","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Yes, Meta. So, we've made good progress on execution of our roadmap with AWS on the strategic collaboration agreement. We have been prioritizing the sort of highest impact opportunities. Both teams are now working very well in the field, we're seeing a number of new opportunities surface that we didn't have access to before, and if you recall in Q4, I said that that's what we expected in part because part of this agreement was that number of AWS solutions architects who face customers every day were going to be trained on F5 Solutions, and we expected them to bring opportunities back to F5, but perhaps we would not have seen before, and that's exactly what we have started to see. So, it's early days in the partnership, and we said that I think we expected it to really give us a meaningful result in the second-half of 2020, but from what we're seeing so far, we're pretty bullish about what we can accomplish together with AWS.","Meta Marshall","Great, thanks.","Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou","Thank you, Meta.","Operator","Thank you for joining today's call. This concludes the call. You may now disconnect."]}}
